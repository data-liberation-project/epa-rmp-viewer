              "Description": "Process Hazard Review Summary\n\nA process hazard review was conducted by the VFSA staff in July of 2007 where the existing equipment and procedures were reviewed in order to establish areas of vulnerability in our system. In this review, the staff established improvements that could be implemented in order to reduce risk of leaks of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and mitigate the hazards from any leaks that may occur. As a result of this hazard review, the steps determined to be implemented included the following improvements:\n\n1.    Rewire ventilation system controls and place them in the remote pump room with a hand-off-auto switch. \n2.    Include an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) for the leak detectors thereby allowing for continuous leak detection if a power failure were to occur. \n3.    Send leak detector signals and alarms to the panel view located in the remote Control Room.\n4.    Replace chlorine control valve with a new valve and rewire new valve (decommission old valve and wiring). \n\nAll of these projects were successfully implemented since July of 2007. In addition the effluent chlorine monitor was replaced with an oxidation reduction potential (ORP) monitor, and minor tank modifications were implemented to allow for better hydraulic flow through the chlorine contact tank. \n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Review in December of 2008 included an evaluation of various disinfection alternatives. Since the VFSA will require additional capacity, this will require significant capital expenditure. Therefore VFSA evaluated various disinfection alternatives using a modeling tool developed by the US Department of Homeland Security. The results of this evaluation indicated coupled with VFSAA?s desire to minimize the risks associated with handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide, implementation of a new ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system to replace the existing chlorination system would be a desirable alternative for the VFSA. As of this writing, the system is in engineering design and it is anticipated that the new UV system will be commissioned by 2011. \n\nAt that time, the PSM requirements for chlorine will not longer apply to the VFSA.  \n",

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe health and well being of every employee and the surrounding community is of vital importance to the Valley Forge Sewer Authority (VFSA).  Accordingly, the Authority strives to maintain its facilities in a safe manner.   This program has been especially successful with respect with our chlorination system as indicated the fact that there has not ever been an accident or leak of chlorine from the start up of our chlorination facilities in 1976 that has resulted in injury of any person, or migration of chlorine gas from the chlorination facility. In spite of the VFSA's successful track record with respect to handling chlorine, the existing wastewater disinfection requires additional capacity to meet the ultimate growth needs of the communities that they serve. As a result, in order to establish the optimal means of expanding upon the capacity of the VFSA's disinfection system, they evaluated various alternatives using the US Department of Homeland Security Decision Tool for Water and Wastewater. As a result of the output from the Decision Tool, the VFSA decided to decommission the use of chlorine as a disinfectant at their wastewater treatment plant. Accordingly, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 THE VFSA HAS BEGUN THE EXPEDITED DESIGN AND SUBSEQUENT CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW ULTRAVIOLET (UV) DISINFECTION SYSTEM. THIS WILL REPLACE THE USE OF CHLORINE AT THIS FACILITY AND AS A RESULT, ONCE SUCCESSFULLY COMMISSIONED, THE RMP WILL NO LONGER APPLY TO THE VFSA. Completion is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010.\n\nThe Valley Forge Sewer Authority provides sewage collection, conveyance and treatment for communities located in eight townships all located in Chester County Pennsylvania.  The VFSA is an operating Authority created in 1968 by Charlestown, East Pikeland, and Schuylkill Townships.  The Authority is the owner and operator of a 9.2 million gallon per day wastewater treatment plant located at 333 Pawling Road, RD #1, Phoenixville, PA, 19460.  In addit"

The VFSA employs 26 full-time professionals to operate and maintain the wastewater collection conveyance and treatment facilities in accordance with Permit Number PA 0043974 issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). A condition of the PADEP permit is that the VFSA provide treated wastewater disinfection to eliminate the potential of adverse effects from microorganisms in the treated effluent.  In order to meet these conditions for treated wastewater disinfection, the VFSA utilizes chlorine as an additive to the treated wastewater.  Chlorine is purchased in one ton cylinders that meet the specifications of the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Chlorine Institute.  The maximum number of containers at the VFSA facility is currently 9.  The chlorination system has been designed, sized, and installed in a manner that is appropriate and in accordance with good engineering practice.  \n\n\nThe VFSA is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 pertaining to risk management planning (RMP Rule)Program 2 because it uses chlorine in quantities that are above the regulatory thresholds. \n\nAs part of an upgrade to accommodate new customers, the chlorination system has been improved in late 1999 to early 2000.  These upgrades  improved upon our existing system and further reduce any risk of an accident.  The improvements consist of: \n\nA? Providing new trunnions for chlorine cylinders to allow for easier movement of potential leading cylinders to move leaks to the gas portion of the cylinder.  \nA? Modifying cylinder-lifting tools to allow chlorine to be delivered via two separate locations thereby eliminating the need to lift cylinders and move them above cylinders that are in operation.\n\nMore recently as a result of a process hazard review in July 2"

Installed the instrumentation to send the leak detector signal to the remote operations control room. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe elements of the Prevention Program for the VFSA chlorination system consists of the following components:\n\nA? Safety Information\nA? Hazard Review\nA? Operating Procedures\nA? Training\nA? Maintenance of Equipment\nA? Compliance Audits\n\nWhereas incident investigation would normally be a component of a Program 2 system, the VFSA has not experienced any incidents involving leaks of chlorine.  Accordingly, although the mechanisms are in place for incident investigation, such investigations have not been necessary to date.  The following provides a summary of each element of Prevention Program as implemented by the VFSA.\n\nSafety Information\n\nmaterial safety data sheets\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided and maintained for review by those individuals that may come in contact with chlorine or chlorination equipment.  The MSDS information is posted in the chlorine facilities, in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and in the Wastewater Treatment Plant Emergency Response Plans, maintained at the VFSA.  Of course, on going operator-training programs assure that individuals are thoroughly trained in the potential hazards associated with chlorine as well as all chemicals handled at the facility.\n\nmaximum intended inventory\n\nMaximum intended inventory at the facility consists of nine (9) one ton chlorine cylinders.

Thermostats control the temperature in these facilities, and the relatively low capacity of the heaters would prevent the excessive heating of the one ton chlorine cylinders. However, there are no potentially flammable chemicals or potential sources of fire in or around the chlorination facility that would result in such an occurrence.\n\nPressure in the piping from the chlorine cylinders to the vacuum regulators is controlled by the vacuum regulators, which are part of the system.  The amount of pressure that can build up upstream of the pressure regulator is limited by the vapor pressure of the chlorine in the cylinder.  The upstream piping, which is under pressure, may only be subjected to the pressure generated by the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the cylinder. This vapor pressure is a function of the substance in the cylinder (chlorine) and the ambient temperature.  This pressure is well within the pressure rating of the piping.\n\nAll piping downstream of the pressure regulators is under vacuum.  The vacuum is produced by an eductor, and the amount of vacuum produced is limited by the size of the eductor, and the eductor's water supply, which is limited by the capacity of the pump supplying water to the eductor.  These are single speed pumps, which can supply only one flow rate to the system.  The amount of vacuum produced is well within the vacuum rating of the piping.\n\ncodes standards and equipment specifications\n\nAll components of the chlorination system have been designed and installed in a manner that is appropriate to its intended service.

This \"Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan is a requirement of PA Code 25, Chapters 101.3 and 78.55.  The purpose of the PPC Plan is to minimize and abate hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or release of hazardous waste to air, soil, or surface water.  The appropriate response to leaks is an integral part of the VFSA SOPs, training programs, and PPC Plan.\n\nThe Plan delineates the organizational structure, duties, and responsibilities of those individuals and organizations responsible for responding to emergencies in the facility.  It includes procedures for responding to spills, such as reporting, arrangements with emergency response agencies and hospitals, notification lists, and chemical information.  Spill countermeasures are described in the Plan.  \n\nIn addition, in cooperation with the Chester County Emergency Coordinator, the VFSA has participated in the development of a Community Response Plan.  The Plan was developed to meet the provisions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III, by the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Chester County.  The plan describes the response to a hazardous material incident emergency at the VFSA.  The elements of the Plan consist of:\n\nA? Categorizing types of releases according to the level of potential hazard.\nA? Delineating responsibilities of the various response organizations, including notifications.\nA? Describing the concept of operations for an appropriate response.\nA? Describing training and exercises that will be implemented."
