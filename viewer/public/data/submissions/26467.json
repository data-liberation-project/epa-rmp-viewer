The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that associates that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New associates receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years, whenever there is a change in the process, or as required.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Plant 5 Pilot Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process technicians, maintenance personnel or any other associate whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Plant 5 Pilot Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPlant 5 Pilot co"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nAssociate Participation\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

In addition, our associates have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn rare occasions, our facility hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Goodyear Plant 5 Pilot Plant are strongly committed to associate, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and associate training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Akron Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are Research and Development where small quantities of rubber are produced.  The regulated substance at our facility is 1,3-Butadiene which is used as a raw material for the preparation of these rubbers.  Waste solvent containing 1,3-Butadiene is stored on site.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA and the on-line EPA program RMP COMP have been employed by our facility to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a Waste Storage Tank.  The scenario involves the release of solvent/1,3-Butadiene (assuming all as 1,3-Butadiene).  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have been considered when evaluating this scenario.  It is assumed that th"

Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance was calculated to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  One alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a Waste Storage Tank.  The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure was determined.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPlant 5 Pilot Plant maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The primary methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our cove"
