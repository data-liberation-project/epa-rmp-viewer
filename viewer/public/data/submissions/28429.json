Southern Water Treatment Company, Inc. accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.\n\nb. Southern Water Treatment is a company devoted to removing metals from wastewater. SWT serves companies all over the United states. The facility is located on White Horse Road in Greenville, South Carolina. The facility includes a Chemical Recovery Area, warehouse and storage area, laboratory, and office/administrative area.  The hazardous chemicals SWT handles in this facility is Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine. The facility is manned from 7:00 am to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. All other times, designated personnel are on call and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume that the ..Maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur\". Southern Water Treatment's worst case scenario's involves Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine. SWT's alternative scenario involves Carbon disulfide and Dimethylamine. \n\nd. The model Southern water Treatment used was the EPA's RMP Comp? model. The model used atmospheric dispersion modeling to determine the distance traveled by the Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The worst case scenario involves liquid spill and vaporization of carbon disulfide released in the maximum quantity possible at 79.4 lbs./minute, and Dimethylamine liquefied under pressure released at the maximum quantity from the vessel.

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has been defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\ne.

Operating procedural training\n? Job Hazard Analysis\n? Audit and Inspection program\n. Site Security Training\n? Hazard communication training\n\nf. No accidental release of carbon Disulfide or Dimethylamine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\ng.
