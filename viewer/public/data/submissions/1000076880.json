      "SummaryText": "The Central Bi-Products facility, located in Redwood Falls, Minnesota (CBP RW), is a Rendering facility that handles chlorine, which is considered toxic by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide a service to the animal and poultry processing facilities by taking non-edible bi-products and processing protein conversion into useful products.  The process includes grinding, fluidizing evaporation and additional processes.  \n\n\n\nCBP RW formerly used chlorine as an oxidizer in odor control systems within the facility.  The facility has switched to a different process to produce chlorine dioxide for its odor control systems.  CBP-RW is no longer subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA RMP programs for chlorine.\n\n\n\nRecently, the facility began using a disinfectant containing formaldehyde in its processing operations.  The amount of formaldehyde stored at the site is above OSHA PSM and EPA RMP thresholds.  This RMP resubmission now covers formaldehyde instead of chlorine.\n\n\n\nSince formaldehyde is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and safe handling procedures that we use and training of our contractors and personnel.\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place at the facility for many years.  This processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures "
