Star Storage is a tank car storage facility (specifically, butane in railcars). This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane storage systems only, of up to four hundred (400) detached 33,600gallon storage rail cars on five miles of leased abandoned rail between milepost MP-311 and MP-306.\nThe ETMT Star Storage complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars. \n\nThe Star Storage is an unmanned storage facility.  ETMT does not operate the railcars or perform maintenance at the storage location.  Inspections/Maintenance of the railcars is provided by DOT offsite.  \n\nTo date, the Star Storage has not had an on-site or off-site accident involving butane, which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place. \n \nStar Storage is a non-responding facility. In the event of an emergency involving ETMT Star LPG (butane) tank car storage, ETMT operations would notify the  Star Volunteer Fire Departments as well as Moore County LEPC as necessary to request their assistance.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the First Health Ambulance Company and Montgomery Memorial Hospital. This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include (Biscoe, Robbins, Troy) and the Montgomery and Moore County LEPCs.  \n\nETMT is committed to safety and always looking for ways to improve process safety systems.
