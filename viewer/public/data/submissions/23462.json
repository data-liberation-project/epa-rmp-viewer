      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nCalpine Corporation's South Point Energy Center uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating South Point Energy Center, Calpine Corporation take its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe South Point Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  South Point Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe South Point Energy Center is located at 3779 Courtwright Road, Mohave Valley, Arizona, in Mohave County.  This power plant is located on a 320-acre property on the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation on the lower western slopes of the Black Mo"

      "SummaryText": "untains.  Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and the Topock Marsh lie approximately 1.2 miles south.  South Point Energy Center is a natural gas fired 544 megawatt combined cycle power plant.  Electricity generated by this facility is transported by lines owned by the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).  Power is delivered from the plant to the Topock substation off-site by two 230 kV transmission lines in order to wheel power to the WAPA distribution grid.  The electricity will be sold under a variety of short-, mid-, and long-term contracts into the Arizona, California, and Nevada markets.\n\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP regulations, in two 14,193 gallon (filled to 85 percent capacity) steel bulk storage tanks.  Ammonia is used at the South Point Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at South Point Energy Center exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.\nRelief Valves.  Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure.  All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment  Piping from the storage tank is equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in event of emergency.  \n\nSecondary Containment. The ammonia storage tanks and vaporizer are located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain 120% of the tank capacity.  The dimension of the containment area is 43 feet by"

These monitors provide a signal to the Control Room to manually activate the deluge systems when high levels of ammonia are detected.  These sensors are located north and south of the secondary containment unit and set to alarm when an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm  is detected in the air.\n\nAlarm System.  The ammonia process is checked at least twice during every 12-hour shift as part of the normal rounds at South Point Energy Center. The storage tank is provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tank also has pressure safety valves,  temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors.  Tank level, temperature, and pressure indication is displayed locally and indication and alarms are displayed on  the Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS).  \n\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash. An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tank. \n\nDeluge System.  A deluge water system, consisting of one spray monitor attached to a fire hydrant located west of the containment area, is provided to dissipate an ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak.  The system will be manually activated in the event of an ammonia leakage.\n\nSolenoid Shut-Off Valve.  On each ammonia storage tank there is a solenoid shut-off valve. This is an electronically operated ball valve that is controlled by the DCS system to initiate valve closure in the event of a leak detected in the process piping.\n  \nSite Security.  The main gate, located on Courtwright Road on the south side of the plant,  provides the primary access to South Point Energy Center.  It is kept closed at all times and it equipped with a keypad, call box, and closed circuit camera so that the Control Room personnel may identify and grant access to visitors at the gate.

There are two emergency exits gates; one is located north of the cooling tower, and the other is on the west side of the service water/firewater pond in the northwest corner of the property.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario requires that a release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts.  Only passive or administrative controls can be considered under the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario for South Point Energy Center is the rupture of an ammonia bulk storage tank, resulting in a release of 63,698 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute duration.  In practice, this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant. \n\nThe released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and disperse as a vapor cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 200 ppm. All required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions - Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (128 degrees F), and average humidity (30 percent).  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an impact to receptors offsite.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for each regulated substance is also required.  The alternative release scenario is a release scenario more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenari"

Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The alternative release scenarios used for ammonia was a small leak in the process piping (flange).  The active mitigation provided by leak detectors was considered. The same modeling approach used was similar to the worst-case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 77 degrees F, and average humidity of 50 percent.\n\nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a much smaller offsite impact.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nSouth Point Energy Center is in compliance with Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Chemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained escape breathing apparatus; awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia;  the presence of ammonia detectors and alarms, and a deluge system to mitigate any releases.\n\nThe South Point Energy Center accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n? Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n? Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\n? Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\n? A process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review\n? Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n?
