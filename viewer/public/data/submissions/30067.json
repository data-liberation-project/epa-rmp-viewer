      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\nThis most recent RMP filing represents the required five year resubmission of the RMP submitted in 1999.\n\nThe Conesville Plant is a coal-fired electric utility.  The plant is operated by American Electric Power and is located in Conesville, Ohio.  The plan has operated under a Title V operating permit issue by the Ohio EPA in 1998. The anhydrous ammonia process is the only process utilizing a regulated chemical above the RMP threshold quantity at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia system is used on Unit 4 at the plant to improve the efficiency of collecting coal combustion by-products in the electrostatic precipitator.\n\nTo prevent an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, the plant uses a safety system that incorporates employee training, system reviews and inspections, as well as a facility wide emergency response plan.  This system has produced a process that operates in a safe and efficient manner with no accidents over the past five years.  Evaluation of potential safety improvement is an ongoing process and safety improvements are made as necessary.\n\nThe plan addresses the procedures to be used in the event of an accidental spill.  The plant has a trained spill response team that can react to a spill 24 hours a day.  The plan also includes phone numbers for contacting outside resources to help contain a spill if necessary.  Employees are provided annual refresher training that reviews emergency action plans, spill prevention and response, as well as emergency contacts.  Employees who work with the ammonia system are provide more in depth training.  Any changes to the system will be investigated through a Process Hazard Analysis prior to being made to ensure the changes do not impact the safety of the system.\n\nThe plan will be managed by the Plant Environmental Coordinator and overseen by the Plant Manager.  The plan will be periodically reviewed to ensure all sections are current."
