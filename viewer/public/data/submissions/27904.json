      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nAt the turn of this century water borne diseases were a leading cause of death in the United States.  Epidemics of typhoid, cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases occurred.  After chlorine?s introduction into public water supplies, deaths from typhoid in the U.S. dropped dramatically from 25,000 in 1900 to less than 20 in 1960.  Water-borne disease is even still a leading cause of infant mortality in many countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America where infant mortality rates are 10 to 20 times greater than in the U.S.  In the U.S., however, water-borne disease has been virtually eliminated due to an effective public health strategy of utilizing chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  Chlorine disinfection is arguably one of the greatest achievements for public health worldwide in the last hundred years and is credited with increasing the life expectancy of Americans by more than 50 percent.\n\nThe use of chlorine is not risk free, however.  Historically it is clear that utilities have recognized the risks and have been successful in developing procedures to handle chlorine safely and to protect the off-site public and the environment from potential accidental releases.\n\nAs an added layer of protection, the United States Environmental Protection Agency promulgated Hazardous Chemical Risk Management Program regulations to further ensure that facility owners understand the risks and take proactive efforts to reduce risk through comprehensive training programs, procedures, and risk mitigation measures.  Additionally, EPA wanted the public to be informed regarding these issues.\n\nThe Florida Governmental Utility Authority (FGUA) has always understood these risks and has maintained a well-trained staff and a safely operated and maintained facility.  The FGUA?s track record is exemplary with respect to handling hazardous chemicals.  Furthermore, the FGUA has taken a comprehensive approach to be in full compliance with the RMP regulation "

      "SummaryText": "by June 21, 1999, and a proactive approach to a public information program.\n\nFacility Background\n\nThe FGUA owns the Golden Gate City Water Treatment Facility (GGCWTF).  Severn Trent is under contract with FGUA to operate the GGCWTF.  The Facility?s mission is to protect public health by providing our community with safe drinking water, free of harmful pathogens.  Approximately 50 pounds per day of chlorine gas are used to disinfect the water and make it safe for human consumption.  A maximum of 6,000 pounds of chlorine are stored on-site.  The chlorine is stored as a gas that is liquefied under pressure in containers that contain 2,000 pounds each.\n\nChlorine Process and Safety Equipment\n\nThe following paragraph provides a brief narrative summary of the Golden Gate City Water Treatment Facility?s chlorine system.  The GGCWTF?s chlorine system is a complete vacuum system that feeds chlorine gas through vacuum regulator-check units (VRCUs) mounted on ton containers.  Pressurized chlorine gas (approximately 130 psig) from the container passes through the VRCU where it is reduced to a slight vacuum.  A vacuum, created as water flows into the injectors, pulls the chlorine gas from the VRCUs, through the chlorinators and into the injector assemblies.  At the injectors chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a dilute (approximately 3500 part per million) chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then distributed to the various application points.  The flow rate of chlorine gas is controlled for each application point by adjustment of the respective chlorinator located just upstream of each injector assembly.\n\nThe complete vacuum system is inherently safe by design since most of the system components are under vacuum.  Any break or damage to a vacuum component will allow air into the system but will not cause a chlorine leak.  The chlorine container, which is under positive pressure, is the only system component where a leak could occur.  In the unlikely event of a chlor"

Once the chlorine leak alarms are activated, Golden Gate City WTF staff will implement the facility?s emergency response program.\nRisk Management and Process Safety Management Program Overview.\n\nChlorine is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation which can be found in 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management Program (PSMP) regulation which can be found in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe primary components of the RMP are as follows:\n\n?    A five-year accident history\n?    An off-site consequence analysis for a worst-case and alternative release scenario\n?    A comprehensive prevention program to minimize risks (i.e. minimize the potential for a release)\n?    An emergency response program to ensure that an accidental release is appropriately handled\n?    An overall management program to supervise the implementation of the RMP\nFollowing development of the RMP, the facility must submit a Risk Management Plan (Plan) to the EPA by June 21, 1999.  The Plan is a summary of the facility?s Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be updated every five years, or whenever a process changes or a new process is added.  The OSHA PSM regulation has basically the same requirements as the prevention program element of the EPA RMP.  The Golden Gate City WTF?s RMP meets the requirements of both regulations.\n\nThe following sections briefly summarize the elements of the Golden Gate City WTF?s RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years, the facility has had no accidental releases, which were required to be reported under the RMP regulation.  It is important to note that the facility has never had an accident that resulted in the worst case nor the alternative release scenarios outlined herein.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case release scenario"

      "SummaryText": " for a toxic gas has been defined by the EPA to be an accidental release in which the largest on-site vessel containing chlorine releases its contents as a gas over ten minutes.  Since the largest container stored at the facility holds 2,000 pounds of chlorine, the worst case release scenario is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over 10 minutes.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release is a ?more likely? incident than the worst-case.  The RMP regulation allows the owner to define the alternative release scenario based on historical experience or operations staff knowledge of their system.   The alternative release scenario for the facility was to assume that the vacuum regulator mounted on the chlorine container gas valve failed.  This scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp software to estimate the distance to an endpoint of 3 ppm.  It should be noted that this concentration has been found to typically cause minor eye and nose irritation.  \n\nPrevention Program\n\nThere are always inherent risks associated with handling and using chlorine.  These risks include the potential inhalation of chlorine gas if it is accidentally released.  The prevention program is a key component to reducing the risk associated with a potential chlorine gas release.  Key elements of the prevention program include:\n\n?    Employee participation\n?    Process safety information\n?    Process hazard analysis\n?    Incident investigation\n?    Operating procedures\n?    Mechanical integrity\n?    Management of change\n?    Pre-startup review\n?
