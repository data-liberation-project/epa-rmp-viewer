The Rodeo Flammable SMR process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nREGULATED CHEMICAL\n\nThe hydrogen plant's steam methane reforming process design basis is to provide a safe, clean and efficient way to produce high purity hydrogen using byproduct Refinery Fuel Gas A and methane as feedstock. The purified hydrogen gas is sold to industrial customer(s). The plant also produces steam and electricity, sold directly to Phillips 66, San Francisco Refinery. The plant is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program. The Hydrogen equipment meets or exceeds design codes and standards. The equipment was designed by engineers. \n\n*Documentation pertaining to the design of the process equipment is maintained.\n\n*Process hazard analysis by HAZOP has been used to identify potential concerns and ensure mitigation to low levels of risk per Air Liquide policy.\n\n*Written procedures have been developed to address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\n*Personnel involved in operating and maintaining the hydrogen p"

Employees take part in process hazard analysis and are trained on and are provided access to the hydrogen process safety information.\n\n*Air Liquide has put in place a safe and hot work permit system to help ensure worker and process safety. This system addresses energy control, safe work, hot work, confined space entry and process line break.\n\n*Where contractors are used to support the covered process, the contractors must first undergo a pre-qualification selection and then planned periodic monitoring process. Individual contractor employees must attend annual site-specific safety training.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe Air Liquide Rodeo Hydrogen Plant has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan. In the event of an accidental release, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) includes information for notifying the San Francisco Phillips 66 Refinery, the Rodeo Hercules Police,"

Personnel annually train and drill on the EAP.  EAP information is provided to local administrating agency and coordinated with the Rodeo Hercules Fire Department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidents have occurred at this site since startup.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Rodeo SMR resolves all findings of its PHA and other hazard reviews, some of which result in modifications of the process. For example, the plant has added a phased array inspection to major process vessels and is incorporating risk based inspection methodologies into its Mechanical Integrity program structure.\n\n"
