If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2. Facility information\n*The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n*Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n*The maximum quantity stored would be 42,900 pounds in our 1 tank, which is a 12,000 gallon vessel. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a semi transport with the capacity of approximately 40,000 pounds.\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n*The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contenets of a 12,000 tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 52,400 pounds, which represents the volume the 12,000 gallon storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion  200 ppm) is 1.4 milies.\n*The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion 200 ppm) is .70 milies.\n4.The accidental release prevention program\n*The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5.
