      "SummaryText": "The Town of Bethlehem Dinmore Road Chlorination Station adheres to all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to the storage of chlorine.  If an emergency were to occur, it is facility policy to evacuate personnel, and call the Albany County Emergency Response Center and request the local Fire Department(s) to respond to the situation.  Facility personnel are not trained in the use of emergency response equipment other than personal protective equipment used while inside the chlorine storage area.\n\nThe facility is used to chlorinate the raw water obtained from the Hudson River by the Town.  The 150 pound containers of chlorine are used in the water treatment process to chlorinate the water\n\nThe worst case release scenario at the facility is failure of a 150 pound cylinder when filled to its maximum capacity, resulting in a release of chlorine over a ten minute period.  According to the EPA's lookup tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nThe Bethlehem Department of Public Works reported that the facility has never had an incident involving chlorine which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.\n"
