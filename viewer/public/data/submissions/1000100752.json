Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nIn this cogeneration facility ammonia, considered by EPA to be a toxic substance, is handled and used.  It is mandatory to observe safety precautions in handling ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health as well as co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is Rio Bravo's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which ammonia is handled.  It is also dependent upon the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that are used and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nRio Bravo's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and outside contractors licensed to service ammonia systems.\r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\n- The primary purpose of this facility is to generate electricity.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n- The regulated substance handled at this facility is ammonia.\r\n- The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this plant is 53,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n3. The off-site consequence modeling consists of both a worst case and an alternative case release scenario for the refrigeration system at the facility.  EPA's \"General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention\" (March 2009) was used as the primary source to determine the downwind distances for each scenario. The affected populace was determined using the CAMEO MARPLOT Version 5.1.1 Mapping Software using the 2010 Census data. The EPA website was checked and the 2020 census data was not available for the Marplot system at the time of this report.\r\n\r\n4.

This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA - 58.  All of the ammonia delivery drivers have been thoroughly trained using the NFPA's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\r\n\r\n5. Five year accident history\r\n\r\nBased on an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the PHA Revalidation meeting on March 3, 2022, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the definition of accident as define above in the last five years (March 2017 - March 2022). In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the past five years.\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook, \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Response Procedures\".   A representative of CalOSHA performed an onsite PSM inspection on January 24, 2018.  All citation items were corrected and settlement with CalOSHA was completed in 2018.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nThe initial Process Hazards Analysis, as well as the subsequent revalidations and addendums, included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection. The Process Hazard Analyses provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Rio Bravo - Fresno facility. The Rio Bravo - Fresno facility's safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n-Removing bypass valves to improve emergency flow shutoff systems.\r\n-Improving Emergency Action Plan provisions for assisting people with disabilities and language barriers during evacua"
