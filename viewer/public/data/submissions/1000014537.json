It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nCFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 in addition to training specifically for ammonia, but are not classified as a formal ammonia response team.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees have received training on this plan.\n\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\n* Reduce the threat to the community\n\nCFC is a group of fruit processing and cold storage facilities, headquartered near the city of Chelan in the county of Chelan.  The facility defined in this summary, has recently been purchased from Stemilt Growers, Inc.of Wenatchee WA and is located in an unincorporated area of Douglas County, across the river and one mile upstream from the unincorporated town of Chelan Falls ( hereafter referred to as CFC Beebe Plant ), state of Washington.\n\nThe regulated substance used at the CFC Beebe Plant is anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7). The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant. There is 17,060 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the CFC Beebe Plant system. The largest interconnected system could potentially release all of this product.\n\nCFC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established"

      "SummaryText": " in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, CFC believes in the concept set forth in the A?General Duty ClauseA? of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, CFC has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\nThe CFC Beebe Plant has not sustained any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years according to it's previous owner, Stemilt Growers, Inc. \n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Chelan Fruit Cooperative has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.  We are an active member of and participate in the Chelan/Douglas County Local Emergency Planning Council ( LEPC ).  \n\nThe most recent process hazard analysis did not identify any needed changes or additions.  Since this is a new facility for Stemilt Growers, Inc., a new compliance audit is planned within this calander year and CFC will continue to ensure that its employees assigned to work on the process receive current training. Refrigeration personnel have received appropriate technician level training from the Ammonia Safety Training Institute (ASTI).\n\nAlso, in order to complete the E Submit for RMP I have been instructed by the CDX Help Desk to insert the date CFC purchased this facility from Stemilt Growers Inc.( 5-30-2010 ) for items in Section 7 in order to be able to submit the RMP electronically at this time.  EPA Region 10 has been notified of this situation.  CFC shall actively work to updating this information such as PHA and other programs in order to comply with regulations as soon as possible and then immediately revise our E Submit RMP for the records.
