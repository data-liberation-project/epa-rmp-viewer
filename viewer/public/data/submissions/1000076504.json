Dunlap Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona is an advanced sand ballasted flocculation water treatment facility that treats water to potable use. The facility is operated by the City of Phoenix, Water Services Division (WSD).  The facility contains a covered process subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMP), 40 CFR 68. \n\n\n\nThe covered process contains chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5), which is injected into the finished water for disinfection; the chlorine system is designed to provide continuous chlorine residual for disinfection. Chlorine storage and supply (chlorine feed system) are located within a dedicated building designed to seal and contain a chlorine release. The chlorine disinfection system is supplied by one-ton chlorine containers (tonners) interconnected in \"banks\" of containers; when in operation, there is an \"on-line\" bank, a \"stand-by\" bank, and a \"back-up\" bank. \n\n\n\nThe chlorine building contains up to 38,000 pounds of chlorine (containers in storage and in-use). The chlorine feed system consists of 2 one-ton containers (tonners) \"on-line\", 2 tonners on \"stand-by\", and a single tonner on a \"back-up\" bank for operation during an emergency (with automatic change features). The tonners connected to the feed system are equipped with motorized control valves and the chlorine feed system can be remotely shutdown in an emergency. Up to 14 additional tonners may be in storage awaiting transfer to the stand-by bank or depleted tonners awaiting return to the chlorine supplier.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorine building is an enclosed building designed to contain a worst-case chlorine gas release and the building is connected to an emergency scrubber that is automatically activated upon chlorine gas leak detection (or manually operated).

      "SummaryText": "rubber capacity is 1 ton. Chlorine gas detection systems within the building activate local alarm strobes and horns, and activate the emergency scrubber for the chlorine building. The emergency scrubber and ventilation system will shut off upon detection of chlorine at the scrubber discharge at 5.0 ppm.  The chlorine building is a secured zone within a secured site, and all access doors to the chlorine building are secured with access controls. A two-person rule applies for entry into the chlorine building.\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) to prevent an accidental release and mitigate the consequences of a chlorine release if it were to occur. The ICP follows the fourteen elements of the PSM standard and the RMP elements. The process hazard analysis (PHA) of the covered process was revalidated in November 2018 and the PSM/RMP program was most recently audited in June 2017; both of these activities were led by a qualified third-party PSM consultant and recommendations resulting from those activities are actively managed by the facility with oversight from the Water Services Division Environmental Services Department.\n\n\n\nThe facility is staffed 24 hours/day by a licensed Water Treatment Operator. The Operator controls the chlorine system from the Operator Control Room within a separate building at the facility.\n\n \n\nThe owner/operator of the facility has implemented an Emergency Response Plan, and personnel who respond to chlorine emergencies are trained accordingly; regular chlorine drills are conducted at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, an alarm on the chlorine gas detection system will automatically notify and dispatch the Fire Department. \n\n"
