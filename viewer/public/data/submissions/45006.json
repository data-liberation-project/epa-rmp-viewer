The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. Seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 1910, respectively.\n\nCrystal prepared the RMP/PSM program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Crystal has written an Emergency Response Program and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Sacramento County Hazardous Materials Response team. Crystal will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nCrystal?s D Street plant is located at 1013 D Street, Sacramento California. The area is zoned for industrial use. .  This facility processes and packages milk products.  The milk products are then distributed to wholesale and retail units.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in the facility?s refrigeration system. The refrigeration system, which is a closed syst"

The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping. The liquid product storage tanks hold the raw milk before processing. The ice cream freezers produce ice cream and do the initial finished product cooling. \n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Crystal D Street facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ??the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.?  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility. Crystal D Street has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion. The Crystal D Street ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down pump components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vesse"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre start-up safety review program and an RMP/PSM auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being prepared for the ammonia system at the facility. The SOPs will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nCrystal D Street is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration system. Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of ammonia system equipment. The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. Crystal D Street reported no accidental release of ammonia during the past five years.\n\nCrystal D Street  has completely redone its Process Hazard Analysis in 2005 and has received a new list of suggested mitigating measures.  Crystal D Street will respond"

Management responses and support will be consistent with Crystal Cream & Butter Company?s commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\n\nCrystal D Street recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Crystal D Street continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Crystal D Street will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Crystal's internal review practices, and Crystal will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM and related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to EPA and other regulatory agencies."
