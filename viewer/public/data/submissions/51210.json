This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release does occur we are completely coordinated with the Caldwell County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Granite Falls Fire Department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects.\n\n2.THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass the manufacturing of polyethylene foam products that are used as packaging material.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, a blend of butane and isobutene.  This regulated substance is used as a blowing agent at our facility.  The maximum inventory of this blend at our facility is 66,000 lbs.\n\n3.THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\nThe worst case release scenario submitted is for a Level 3 flammable substance, which involves a catastrophic release from a blowing agent storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 45,000 lbs of a butane/isobutane blend.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes have not been considered when evaluating the worst case source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under the worst case weather conditions, the consequence distance from the explosion of the vapor cloud to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch is 0.3 miles.  \n\nThe Alternative release scena"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPregis performs documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment to ensure proper operation.   Process equipment examined by these checks include but are not limited to storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  The maintenance operations are done by qualified personnel with the previous training in maintenance practices; and these personnel are provided specialized training as needed.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Pregis to manage changes in covered process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Operators, maintenance personnel or any other employees whose job task are affected by a modification in the covered process conditions are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to additions and modifications to the covered process are conducted as a regular practice at Pregis.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operation and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation\n\nCompliance Audits\nPregis will continue to conduct periodic audits to ensure that the provisions set forth under the RMP and SPM rules are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation \nPregis promptly investigat"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions that would prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained at our facility for a minimum of 5 years. \n\nEmployee Participation\nPregis truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and they actively participate in process safety management.  In addition, Pregis employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Pregis hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough safety performance evaluation of the contractor is carried out.  Pactiv has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00bfs work and the covered process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nPregis has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Because Pregis\u00bfs stringent release prevention programs, there have been no significant accidental releases during this period.\n\n6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nPregis maintains a written emergency evacuation plan for the safety of its employees during accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations and notification of local emergency response agencies.  Pregis employees do not respond to the emergency. \n\nEmergency notification equipment is regularly inspected and serviced to insure prope"
