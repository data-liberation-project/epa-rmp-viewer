This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Lineage \u0097Manteca EPA RMP Program Level 3 is a facility-run program with continuous support from the Lineage Compliance Department. It includes Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nLineage \u0097Manteca is located at 730 Spreckels Road, California. \nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is rural, with a mixture of light industrial and residential areas.  \nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of implementing the EPA RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and performed by Lineage-Manteca, which also serves to manage process safety opportunities associated with using anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over 10,000 lbs., the federal threshold for EPA RMP, as a result, the anhydrous ammonia-covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to EPA RMP Program Level 3.\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:\n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis,"

The Facility Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local responding units, such as the local fire department or HAZMAT Team. \n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include:\n\u0095\tA Hazard Assessment, which was performed on 01/09/2025\n\u0095\tA Seismic Assessment, which was performed on 12/18/2024.\n\u0095\tA Process Hazard Analysis, which was performed on 05/09/2022.\n\u0095\tA Compliance Audit, which was performed on 05/13/2022."
