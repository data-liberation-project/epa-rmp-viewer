ExxonMobil, operator of BRPP, has a long-standing dedication to safety and environmental stewardship as the corporation's primary goal. Safety and protection of the environment are an integral part of ExxonMobil's operations and corporate culture.  \n\nBRPP's dedication to safety is demonstrated in many ways.  To help ensure the safety of BRPP operations, BRPP invests significant resources in accident prevention. Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and other operations facilities.  BRPP's policies and our dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help prevent releases of hazardous substances.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with our Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nBRPP, located in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, is owned and operated by ExxonMobil Chemical Company (ExxonMobil).

The largest quantity is evaluated because the regulations guide the operator to consider the largest quantity of the substance in a process or operation if a listed substance is used or located in different processes or operations on a plant site.  The term \"threshold quantity\" is simply the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated under these new regulations.  Based on process knowledge, ExxonMobil identified the regulated substances involved in the operation and determined the quantities of each regulated substance on the site.\n\nBRPP uses six regulated substances above the threshold quantity in 14 separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate.\n\nDETERMINATION OF PROGRAM LEVEL FOR THE SITE\n\nThe new regulations under which this document was prepared (i.e., 40 CFR Part 68) require the operator to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" which the EPA has defined as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure?\"  Based on this required evaluation of a hypothetical and extremely unlikely scenario, the distances to endpoints (i.e., an overpressure of 1 psi) exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial, commercial and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas, inhabited or occupied by the public).  BRPP is also subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.

      "SummaryText": "ALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe ARP Program requires one worst-case scenario for all listed toxic substances.  As required by the ARP Program regulations, the worst case release scenario was used to evaluate such a scenario involving the toxic regulated substance that is on site in a quantity above the threshold quantity (vinyl acetate).  The ERPG-2 for vinyl acetate (0.26 mg/l) was used to determine the distance to endpoint in the event of a release.  The hypothetical scenario involving the release of vinyl acetate was found to have a distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe ARP Program requires the assumption of an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion, regardless of whether such a scenario is realistic.  According to EPA regulations, the endpoint for the \"worst-case release\" of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure, which would result from such a worst-case release scenario.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in this scenario shall be used to determine the distance to the endpoint.  Passive mitigation systems are not applicable to the \"worst case release scenario\" because, according to the regulations, this scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud.\n\nAs required by the ARP Program regulations, the regulatory definition of the \"worst case release scenario\" was used to evaluate such a scenario for those regulated substances that are on site in quantities above their appropriate threshold butane, 1-butene, ethylene and propylene.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for each such scenario was determined.  These distances were calculated using the EPA equations.  The hypothetical scenario that involves the butane was found to be the one with the longest distance to the endpoint, with a 0.54-mile distance to the endpoint.  Accordingly, under the regulations, this scenario involving butane is defined as the \"worst-case release s"

These hypothetical scenarios are termed \"alternative release scenarios.\"  Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems is allowed for alternative release scenarios.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative-case release scenario for each toxic substance that will reach an endpoint off-site is required under the ARP Program.  The alternative-case release scenario for vinyl acetate is a pump failure on TK-932, resulting in the deinventory of 11,000 pounds of vinyl acetate into the pump diked area.  The evaluation is based upon the assumption that the pump containment area is completely filled with vinyl acetate.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.07 miles which is within the plant boundary.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe new ARP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable substances.  Vapor cloud explosions (VCE) produced from releases of various quantities of ethylene in congested areas were evaluated for risks within the explosive domain.  It was determined that there are no alternative-case release scenarios capable of producing a 1 psi overpressure beyond the fenceline.

BRPP has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program regulations for consistency and effectiveness. Because processes at BRPP that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees at BRPP are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, BRPP has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBRPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address written data and engineering drawings on the design of the facility, the chemistry of the process and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key pr"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any of the process safety information.\n\nSafety data is maintained for all chemicals that are used, handled, or produced at the facility.  This data includes permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosive information, thermal and chemical stability, toxicity data (if applicable), personal protective equipment, and measures to be taken in the event of physical contact or airborne exposure to a chemical.  This information is maintained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), as part of OSHA's Hazard Communication Program at the plant.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented the safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automatic shutdown systems.\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBRPP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated w"

This is a systematic procedure in which each process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards, and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBRPP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings and suggestions are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking process is intended to ensure that potential hazards that are considered to have the highest priority receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, BRPP maintains CAPS (Compentency Analysis Profile System) Documentation which contain sections, that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nBRPP employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.  New employees receive job-specific basic training in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through test, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, BRPP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Safety personnel periodically monitor contractor safety performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nBRPP conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure, before startup of the modified process or unit, that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.

These response procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and for accounting for all personnel (employees, contractors, and visitors) after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training to enable them to fulfill their role in an emergency.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for BRPP is coordinated with the East Baton Rouge Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  BRPP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a method for notifying the public in the event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to"
