The plant primarily manufactures anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), that provide farmers with high-quality, cost effective nutrients for the crops they grow to feed families around the world.  As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, producing anhydrous ammonia and other fertilizer products utilizing ammonia as a feedstock, this facility is subject to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for Koch Nitrogen Company Dodge City Nitrogen Plant at Dodge City, Kansas.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nThe Dodge City facility has an ammonia and a UAN plant.  The ammonia plant, in production for about 30 years, produces 310,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia annually.  The UAN plant, in production for more than 20 years, produces 257,000 tons of UAN annually.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nThe Dodge City facility, employees 54 Kansas residents at a combined annual salary of nearly $3.2 million dollars.  KNC supports Dodge City and the state of Kansas with nearly $500,000 in state and local taxes annually.  Nearly $3 million dollars is spent locally on electricity and miscellaneous purchases for the"

The facility also sponsors local youth soccer, baseball and football teams.\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nKNC employees are very involved in community activities.  Many facility employees are active and participate in public and community groups such as the Dodge City Chamber of Commerce and Women?s Chamber of Commerce, Rotary International and the Teen Center.  Employees are also active in charity work including United Way, The Red Cross blood drive and March of Dimes.  In addition, staff members are active with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nKNC employees recognize that community involvement and volunteerism is the most effective way to improve the communities in which they live.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nKNC is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We pledge to eliminate or reduce our use of toxic substances and to minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.  We strive to prevent the generation of pollution at the source, but, where that cannot be achieved, we are committed to environmentally sound methods of recycling, treatment and disposal.  By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility consisting of a large scale, natural gas feed ammonia production unit and an integrated UAN pro"

The UAN unit was added in 1974.\n\nThe facility produces, handles, and stores large quantities of anhydrous ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with by-product carbon dioxide to produce liquid urea in the UAN plant.  Ammonia and air in the same plant are used to produce nitric acid which is subsequently neutralized with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate.  The liquid urea and ammonium nitrate are mixed forming the urea-ammonium nitrate solution product.\n\nEach of these production units along with product ammonia storage and handling constitute the processes covered by the EPA RMP Rule.  Regulated substances include the primary product of the plant, anhydrous ammonia, which is also the main feed stock for urea-ammonium nitrate production.  In addition, flammable substances as a class, methane (natural gas) and hydrogen produced as an intermediate in ammonia production specifically, are regulated under the RMP Rule.  Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as a biological control agent in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.  It is the policy of this facility to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and in particular, hazardous and regulated substances, and to minimize and eliminate, to the extent possible, even minor and inconsequential releases of any type.

The audit is conducted by persons knowledgeable of the facility processes, but not directly connected with the facility.\n\nThe facility is diligent in adhering to and maintaining its Process Safety/Prevention Program.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant has a written Emergency Response Program as required by the RMP Rule and other EPA and OSHA rules.  This Plan is coordinated with the local community response plan and is available to responding agencies.  Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, LEPC, and other appropriate agencies such as the local fire department.\n\nThe facility is an active participant in the LEPC and interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as local fire departments; law enforcement agencies such as the police, highway patrol, and sheriff?s office; and hospitals.\n\nEmployees receive annual training in the response plan and also receive various safety training, both in general, and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodically the plan is practiced in a tabletop, classroom type setting, and it also is drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe RMP Rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant has had no qualifying accidents in the past five years.\n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe RMP Rule requires a hazard analysis for hypothetical ?worst-case? and alternative release scenarios for regulated"

      "SummaryText": " substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as regulated toxics, and flammables as a class, which include methane and hydrogen.  The rule requires an analysis of the hypothetical ?worst case? toxic release as that scenario affecting the greatest distance and a hypothetical ?worst-case? flammable accident as a vapor cloud explosion.  Alternative release scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by the ultimate consumer.  The RMP rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the hypothetical ?worst case? event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of anhydrous ammonia is held in either of the two atmospheric storage tanks.  The quantity for one tank is 30,000 tons.  However, the worst-case release pertains to the 200-ton anhydrous ammonia high-pressure non-diked bullet tank.  The hypothetical ?worst-case? release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank.  This unlikely event was modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events.  Details of the results of this modeling are provided elsewhere in the RMP Submittal.\n\nTo assure that the event indicated above was, in fact, the hypothetical ?worst case? as t"

In addition, a hypothetical ?worst-case? failure of chlorine containers was similarly modeled.  Neither of these resulted in a distance greater than the circumstance noted above.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is low.  Analysis of this scenario was completed as required by the rule.  Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and substantially reduce the probability of such massive and improbable failures.\n\nWorst-Case Flammable Substances\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the hypothetical ?worst case? for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia conversion loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look up Tables.  Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small.  Impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternative Release - Toxics\n\nAmmonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Substantially lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility is the accidental breakage of the four-inch ammonia pipe that goes to the loading rack.  Modeled impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonab"

It is used as a gas from one-ton chlorine cylinders through an injection system to the circulating cooling water.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed is failure of the connecting tubing from the cylinder and release of gaseous chlorine.  This release was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program.\n\nFlammables\n\nVolumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines in comparison to the large release contemplated in the hypothetical ?worst-case? analysis.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed the synthesis loop relief valve has lifted for three minutes.  The impact distance of this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Look Up Tables.  More reasonable and likely events result in minimal impact distances.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\nPartially as a result of this continual review, the Dodge City Nitrogen Plant has rebuilt its diking that provides spill mitigation around its atmospheric ammonia storage tanks.  Completion of this project has provided complete and full containment of the contents of the tanks in the unlikely event of a tank failure.  This has substantially reduced the potential affected distances and consequences o"
