We regard environmental compliance as a prerequisite to commercial success, and strive to ensure the safety of our community and employees by assuring the safe operation of our processes.  We at NovaStar LP attempt to instill a proactive culture toward regulatory compliance which prompts our employees to strive for excellence in the areas of environmental, health, and safety compliance.  \n\nNovaStar LP focuses on the use of sound scientific and engineering principals to manage risks that may arise from our regulated processes.  Our facility is designed and operated to mitigate the potential for any adverse environmental impact.  \n\nThrough the implementation of this Risk Management Plan, NovaStar LP endeavors to comply fully with those regulations set forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR PART 68.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nNovaStar LP has prepared and maintains a SPILL PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND COUNTERMEASURE PLAN (SPCC PLAN) which outlines our accidental release prevention philosophy and policy.  The SPCC plan identifies the potential for an accidental release by identifying the Aboveground Storage Tanks, their contents, and the maximum quantity of chemical that could potentially be released in a catastrophic event.  Engineering controls are also identified in the SPCC plan to document measures taken to mitigate potential accidental releases.  \n\nA STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SW3P) has also been fostered to illustrate best management practices, prevent releases, identify release potential, document past releases, monitor storm water for visual or analytical indications of impact, and to analyze the overall risk of accidental release of chemical.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nNovaStar LP also maintains an EMER"
