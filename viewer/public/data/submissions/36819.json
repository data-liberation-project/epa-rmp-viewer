The \n\nmixtures are used as propellant for aerosol paint cans.  The two processes \n\nare: (1) propellant injection into aerosol cans (the propellant process), and \n\n(2) finished goods warehousing.\n\n\n\nPropellant is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure and is stored in \n\nan 18,200-gallon water capacity storage tank at a pressure of \n\napproximately 70 to 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).  \n\nAdministrative controls in place at the facility, including written loading \n\nprocedures, limit the tank fill volume to 85 percent of capacity, resulting in \n\na maximum on-site propellant mass of 68,548 pounds.  The storage tank \n\nand transfer piping are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nFinished goods are transferred to the on-site warehouse for storage and \n\ndistribution.  Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids \n\nare stored in 15- to 20-ounce cans.  Approximately 250,000 pounds of \n\npropellant may be stored in the well-protected warehouse at any one time.\n\n\n\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is \n\nnot inherently toxic.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe True Value propellant filling system consists of the single storage tank, \n\npiping from the storage tank to a small propellant fill room, and two \n\naerosol can filling machines.  A pump is used to transfer the propellant \n\nfrom the storage tank into the propellant fill room.  The filling machine \n\nregulates the incoming pressure of the propellant and injects the \n\npropel"

The equipment and \n\ninterconnecting piping are part of a closed system, thereby minimizing the \n\npotential of a large release.\n\n\n\nThe propellant filling system is protected by specific safety systems and \n\nhardware which include safety relief valves, excess flow valves, and safety \n\ninterlocks and alarms.  Safety relief valves protect the storage tank and the \n\npiping to the propellant filling machine.  Excess flow valves are located at \n\nall inlet and outlet connections to the storage tank.  The excess flow valves \n\nclose if a larger-than-normal flow of propellant from the vessel were to \n\noccur.  Gas detectors and alarms within the filling room monitor the \n\nambient air to ensure proper operation of the system.  Abnormally high \n\nconcentrations of propellant within the propellant fill room will actuate \n\nspecial exhaust equipment and, if levels continue to rise, shut down the \n\nprocess.\n\n\n\nOnce filled and packaged, cartons of aerosol cans are transferred to the \n\nfinished goods warehouse.  In the warehouse, the cans are stored in a fully \n\nsprinklered rack system until they are shipped off site.\n\n\n\nPropellant filling is accomplished in a closed system.  Historical releases of \n\npropellant have included only small volumes infrequently released from \n\nthe filling machine inside the propellant fill house.
