Nevertheless, Producers Dairy Fresno continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Producers Dairy Fresno\u0092s ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Producers Dairy Fresno\u0092s management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nProducers Dairy Fresno has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Producers Dairy Fresno has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Producers Dairy Fresno now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \u0093living document\u0094. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Producers Dairy Fresno employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Producers Dairy Fresno will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The elevation of the machinery room was designed with the flood hazards in mind.\n\nProducers Dairy is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site.

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Producers Dairy Fresno has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Producers Dairy Fresno, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Producers Dairy Fresno has developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.
