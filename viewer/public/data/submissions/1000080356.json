Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident protection and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs. Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include:  personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant and loading facility personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\r\n\t\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE WETUMKA LIQUID LOADING FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka Liquid Loading Facility (Wetumka LLF), located approximately six (6) miles south of Wetumka in Hughes County, Oklahoma, operates a highway loading facility. This loading facility receives propane by pipeline from the Enable Midstream Wetumka Gas Plant approximately 4 \u00bd miles away. This propane is a natural gas liquid (NGL) product comprised primarily of propane, but can contain small amounts of ethane and butane, all of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Wetumka LLF which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\t Propane Storage Tank comprised of a primarily propane (NGL) mixture.\r\n\t\r\nThis storage vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endpoint potential of a regula"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\t\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\t\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119 does not apply to the Wetumka LLF due to its status of an unmanned facility.\r\n\t\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\t\r\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Wetumka LLF is classified as a Program Level 2 facility.  Under Program Level 2 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release a regulated flammable mixture is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the propane NGL mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 219,094 pounds (80% of the maximum tank capacity).  However, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory (100% maximum tank capacity of 273,868 pounds) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.21 miles or 376 yards.  Additionally, although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS for the Wetumka LLF.\r\n\t\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Wetumka LFF is a VCE resulting from a 10 minute release of propane NGL from a propane loading pump seal leak totaling 34,000 pounds.  The release is expected to be isolated by the gas detection system initiating a facility emergency shutdown within ten (10)  minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 0.09 miles or 159 yards.\r\n\t\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\t\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release preventi"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\t \r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the loading facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in our Operating Procedures and/or Process Safety Information. The loading facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\t\r\nThe loading facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\t\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings/recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval/revision, and the final resolution of the action tasks will be documented and retained.\r\n\t\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, including (1) initial unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\t\r\nIn addition, the Wetumka LLF maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\t\r\nTraining\r\n\t\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Wetumka LLF has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in loading facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\t\r\nContractors\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the loading facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform loading facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Wetumka LLF evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Loading facility/plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\t\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\t\r\nThe Wetumka LLF conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems"

In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing and use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or lessons learned from other Enable Midstream gas plants and facilities.  \r\n\t\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Wetumka LLC is coordinated with the Hughes County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Wetumka LLC has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).
