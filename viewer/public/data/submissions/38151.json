Ashdown Mill (Ashdown Mill) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Ashdown Mill workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the Company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation, 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at Domtar Industries Inc. in Ashdown. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substance regulated by the RMP Rule - see topic 1.2\n \n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substance (covered process) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substance from the covered process - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the program.  These elements include the preparation and maintenance of the hazards assessment, accident prevention program (including OSHA PSM), and emergency response plan; RMPlan preparation, submittal, and communication.

Chlorine Dioxide is produced at the facility and stored as a diluted aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where as high as 12.0 gram-per-liter (1.2 wt. %) strength solution is produced.\n\n1.4 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n1.4.1Chlorine Dioxide\n\nThere was one accident within the last five years involving the release of chlorine dioxide which resulted in an injury to a contractor employee.  This release was limited to three minutes due to the quick reaction of our employees.  The contractor employee was working in a pipe rack when he accidentally struck a valve handle on a washout line.  This accident caused the valve to crack open and release a small amount of ClO2 solution and ClO2 gas.  Because of the location, the individual could not evacuate quickly and he inhaled some ClO2 vapors.  He was treated locally for gas inhalation by emergency personnel and was transported to a hospital for treatment.  It was estimated that no more than ten pounds of ClO2 gas was released with no offsite consequences.  An accident investigation revealed that the cause was human error, however steps were taken to prevent recurrence.\n\nThere was one accident within the last five years involving chlorine dioxide which resulted in an injury to an employee.  A maintenance worker was exposed to chlorine dioxide fumes while working on our No. 63 Paper Machine Saveall.  Chlorine dioxide was used as a biocide and a malfunction of the biocide addition system caused the addition of higher than normal amounts of chlorine dioxide.  The maintenance employee, working above the addition point, was exposed to the fumes from the chl"
