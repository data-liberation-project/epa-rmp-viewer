      "SummaryText": "The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for management and prevention of risks associated with the storage and use of chlorine, a regulated toxic substance, at Caguas RWWTP. The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(1). The Prevention Elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) System prepared in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements. The disinfection process at the Caguas RWWTP uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO, and EQB. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Caguas RWWTP observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the Caguas RWWTP and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release as well as a written emergency program for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Caguas RWWTP discharges into the Bairoa River. Chlorine is used to treat the water in order to eliminate objectionable odors.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in 1-ton containers. The maximum inventory of chlorine is 18,000 pounds. Chlorine containers are connected to vacuum chlorinators, a system that regulates vacuum and chlorine flow in the system.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of many elements and its objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment and the property.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program. Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any"

The emergency response program is coordinated with the local Emergency Response Agency (EQB) for notification of the public. PRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety; issues identified from a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improved preventive maintenance program."
