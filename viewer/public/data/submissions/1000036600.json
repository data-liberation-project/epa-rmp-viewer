The audit involved completing two checklist documents to compare the existing chlorine safety program with EPA and OSHA requirements. The first checklist examined the safety program documentation kept on file by AWWU, while the other evaluated the physical facilities at the AWWTF chlorine system.\r\n\r\nThe PHA completed for this Risk Management Plan update included a \"what-if\" workshop with operators. The PHA identified, ranked, and analyzed potential process hazards associated with the use, storage, and handling of chlorine. Recommendations to improve process safety were generated during the PHA workshop.\r\n\r\nAn ongoing contract will convert the disinfection system to onsite generation of 12.5 percent sodium hypochlorite. This document represents the five-year update to the 2008 submission and will be the final Risk Management Plan submitted to the EPA for the existing chlorine gas disinfection system."

      "SummaryText": "The Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) provides potable water and domestic wastewater utility service to customers within the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska. Constructed in 1971 through 1973, the John M. Asplund Wastewater Treatment Facility (AWWTF) is a conventional primary treatment plant rated for an average day flow of 58 million gallons per day (MGD), with current flows averaging approximately 28 MGD. It is permitted to operate under an NPDES permit with a section 301(h) modification administered by the EPA. \r\n\r\nThe AWWTF currently uses chlorine gas for effluent disinfection. Chlorine is delivered in liquid form via trucks with detachable flatbeds. Each flatbed carries 12 chlorine containers (containing one ton of chlorine each). At the disinfection building, the flatbeds are detached and stored within one of two storage bays. A monorail system is used to transport individual chlorine containers from the flatbed to the adjacent chlorine storage room. The disinfection system normally operates with a total of eight one-ton chlorine containers available at any time. Chlorine containers are arranged in two parallel trains, each including four containers piped together into a common manifold. Each chlorine container includes two discharge valves, one situated at the bottom of the tank, the other near the top of the tank. The chlorine injection system relies on the relatively high vapor pressure of liquid chlorine at room temperature to volatilize liquid chlorine within the chlorine tank. The upper valves on the chlorine tank are configured to withdraw the gas portion of chlorine from the upper part of the container, while the lower valves are configured to withdraw liquid chlorine from the bottom of the tank. Once the containers are in place, operations personnel connect each container such that chlorine gas is withdrawn from the container's upper valves. \r\n\r\nChlorine gas is drawn through the system using negative pressure created by the chemical induc"

      "SummaryText": "tion system used for effluent water chlorine injection. Each train of four containers delivers chlorine gas to a standard water bath heated evaporator. A pressure relief valve is installed at the top of each evaporator pressure vessel to protect against an overpressure condition. A rupture disc is installed at the inlet supply to the valve, therefore the valve is not normally exposed to gas. From the evaporator, heated chlorine gas is drawn into one of two chlorinators that control the flow rate and gas pressure delivered to the chemical induction system. When the tanks are nearly empty, one of the chlorinators operates using a fixed chlorine gas dosage, and the other delivers a variable dosage controlled by an oxidation reduction probe (ORP) mounted in the effluent tunnel box. The chlorine gas solution is injected at the north effluent box using a chemical induction mixing system.\r\n\r\nAccording to US EPA 40 CFR 68, chlorine is considered a toxic chemical and is subject to specific regulations when it is stored on-site in excess of threshold quantities established by the EPA. For the AWWTF, the threshold quantity for chlorine use and storage is 2,500 pounds. The AWWTF currently stores chlorine gas in excess of this threshold storage quantity; therefore, the requirements of US EPA 40 CFR 68 apply. The law states that the facility shall develop and implement a Risk Management Program and maintain documentation of the program by preparing a Risk Management Plan. The current Risk Management Program is kept on file by AWWU and was the primary reference source used in this review. \r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes air modeling using the EPA software RMP*Comp. The goal of the offsite consequence analysis was to estimate the physical extents of the hazardous zone during worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios of chlorine gas from the facility. The theoretical toxic extents generated by the model were then compared to sensitive receptors in the area to q"
