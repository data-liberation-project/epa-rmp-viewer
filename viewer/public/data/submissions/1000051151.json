Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nMorada Produce operates a commercial packing and storage facility for cherries, walnuts, bell peppers, and onions in Stockton, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(1) Palletizing Room\n\n(1) Shipping Cooler\n\n(3) Cold Storage Rooms\n\n(1) Precool Room\n\n(1) Receiving Cooler\n\n(2) Fumigation Rooms\n\n(3) Cherry Hydrocoolers\n\n(1) Receiving Hydrocooler\n\n\n\nEach of the above-named refrigerated zones are equipped with evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation. All control valve groups are mounted on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within a central refrigeration machinery room. Seasonally, Morada Produce rents two (2) high-side ammonia trailers to add additional refrigeration capacity for the cherry season. A partial list of permanent system components includes:\n\n(3) High Pressure Receivers\n\n(2) Suction Accumulators\n\n(2) Dump Traps\n\n(4) Frick Screw Compressors\n\n(1) Emergency Control Box\n\n(1) Machinery Room Ventilation System\n\n(1) Ammonia Diffusion Tank\n\n(18) Flooded Accumulators\n\n(6) Ceiling Suspended Air-Cooling Evaporators\n\n(19) Bunker Mounted Air-Cooling Evaporators\n\n(6) Hydrocooler Coils\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each zone or hydrocooler, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and "

From there, the ammonia is piped to the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe refrigeration system at Morada Produce was originally built in 2003 by Cold Storage Technologies. It was later modified in 2008 and again in 2011. Schrader Mechanical is the preferred refrigeration contractor and performs periodic maintenance on the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to a machinery room contains emergency refrigeration shutdown and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Morada Produce consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, Morada Produce has one (1) ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nMorada Produce has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy b"

Nevertheless, Morada Produce continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Morada Produce's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Morada Produce's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nMorada Produce has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Morada Produce has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Morada Produce now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Morada Produce employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Morada Produce will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
