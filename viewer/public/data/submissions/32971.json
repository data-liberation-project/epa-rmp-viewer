Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Porterville Wastewater Treatment Facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance under (CalARP) and is considered in this (RMP).  Safety precautions are necessary to prevent exposure to facility workers and the community. The facility must adhere to all Federal and State of California rules and regulations.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facilty is an eight million gallon per day wastewater treatment facility for domestic and industrial users.  Chlorine is used to at the headwork for odor control and at the secondary clarifiers to help in  settling of suspened solids and algea control.  To protect public health, chlorine is added to the effluent contact chamber for disinfection of pathogenic organisms. There is a daily maximum of 16,000 lbs of chlorine on-site.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nFor a one-ton container of chlorine the release rate of 2,000 lbs of chlorine at 200lbs/min for 10 minutes is used.  The Distance to endpoint is 3.1 miles at 3 ppm of chlorine.  This release will extend beyond the boundries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release rate is determined on complete failure and seperation of 1/4 inch fuse plug.  At release rate of 252 lbs for 1 hour the treated fumes from the chlorine building will exit the exhaust stack of the chlorine scrubber system at 5 ppm.  Distance to endpoint is 39 feet at 3 ppm.  This release will not extend beyond the boundries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit distances for reported scenarios exist to minimize, the relased from a one-ton container or prevent a release from occuring. \n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nLimit distances for each scenario to restrict the amount of chlorine relased to a minimum.  These measures are based upon design, inspection, testing, and maintenea"

General Accidental Relase Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies will all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  Safety meetings, training, and the PSM are implemented for the chlorine process system and represent the facilites main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidential chlorine releases during the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThis program is based upon alerting personnel to evacuate the facility and await the arrivial of the Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if an evacuation is required.  The Tulare County-Environmental Health incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achive increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system. These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for the accidental relase of the regulated substance."
