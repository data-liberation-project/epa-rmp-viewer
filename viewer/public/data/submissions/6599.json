The facility is inspected annually by the corporate auditor and insurance carrier to evaluate the facility's safety programs.  Mr. Joseph McCorkel, the individual with overall responsibility for this RMP, is an active member of the Elkhart County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nEstablished in 1937, Johnson Controls, Inc. is a major manufacturer of refrigeration control systems.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, as a source of hydrogen fuel  for a metal heat treating operation.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in two 4,000 gallon tanks and is piped to two gas dissociators which break the ammonia into its elemental gasses, hydrogen and nitrogen.  Hydrogen is directed to the heat treating furnaces and nitrogen, the major natural component in air, is vented to atmosphere.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was modeled according to EPA guidelines and involves the catastrophic failure of one, full anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  It is not likely that such an event would occur.  EPA requires that five alternative release scenarios be considered and that one more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario be used in an off-site consequence analysis.  This facility has no history of ammonia under EPA's alternative release scenarios.  Therefore, for purposes of this Risk Management Plan (RMP), the example alternative release scenario provided in EPA's \"Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\" was used.  It is not likely that this alternative release scenario would occur.\n\nJohnson Controls, Inc. has safely operated the anhydrous ammonia system, without incident, since it was installed in 1968.  The facility is continually working to improve the safety of this anhydrous ammonia system.  Recently a roof was installed over the tanks to shield them from the"
