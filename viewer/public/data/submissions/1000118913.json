Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Norbest Division Moroni has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Norbest Division Moroni, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Norbest Division Moroni has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                 | Process Chemical                | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nRefrigeration Process 1        Anhydrous Ammonia                 36,000\nRefrigeration Process 2        Anhydrous Ammonia                  6,800 (THIS PROCESS IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RMP/PSM REGULATION)\n\n* While it is recognized that Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni's Process 2 does not meet the threshold requirement for being subject to the  Federal OSHA PSM and Federal RMP regulations.  Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni has chosen to adopt RMP/PSM policy which incorporates elements from Federal OSHA PSM and Federal RMP requirements. This decision was made willingly to enhance the quality of the facility's RMP/PSM program. No Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) has requested Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni to adhere to Federal OS"

As such, Pitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni should only be held to the OSHA PSM and Federal RMP requirements for Process 1.\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation that also meets the  RMP obligations \n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\nPitman Farms Norbest Division Moroni operates a turkey processing plant in Moroni, UT. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\nSystem 1\n(2) Blast Freezers\n(3) Cool Rooms\n(2) Freezer Rooms\n(1) Processing Room\n(1) Production Floor\n\nSystem 2\n(2) Holding Freezers\n\nMost refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators, which utilize liquid recirculators as required for liquid overfeed operation. Select portions of the system utilize accumulators as required for flooded operation. Most control valve groups are located inside the building near its corresponding equipment. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above the machinery room. \n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhyd"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nNorbest Division Moroni has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Norbest Division Moroni facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.  It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nNorbest Division Moroni has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\nNorbest Division Moroni's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\n- Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a7191"

All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNorbest Division Moroni has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Norbest Division Moroni continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Norbest Division Moroni's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Norbest Division Moroni's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nNorbest Division Moroni has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Norbest Division Moroni has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Norbest Division Moroni now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
