This facility includes the Treatment Plant, eight million gallons of storage in the clearwell, a 10,000 acre ft. water storage reservoir and chemical storage.  This plant uses ozone, chlorine and ammonia to disinfectant the water from Lake Bard to meet regulatory standards prior to distribution.  Chlorine is stored in a scrubber protected; cement block building.\n\nThe Calleguas Municipal Water District Board of Directors, management and all employees are committed to the safe operation of the Lake Bard Water Filtration Plant. This commitment is reflected in the design, operation, maintenance, and procedures used to operate the plant. Calleguas has used chlorine gas safely at this facility since it was constructed in 1964 and aqueous ammonia safely since 1995.  The focus of Calleguas policies are to operate and maintain the chlorine disinfection system of the Lake Bard Water Filtration Plant in such a way as to protect Calleguas employees, the surrounding communities and the environment from a chlorine or ammonia leak.  The policies incorporate the highest level of commitment to establishing safety by insuring multiple, redundant and parallel layers of safety.  The equipment is engineered for safety, procedures are developed for safe operation, safety is incorporated into training, employees are provided personal protective equipment, and emergency response procedures are coordinated with the local responding agencies. \n\nRegulated substances \n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District uses and stores only one federally regulated substance, chlorine gas, requiring the development of this Risk Management Plan.  The chlorine gas is stored and used directly from Department of Transportation certified one (1)-ton cylinders.\n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District also uses and stores 19% Aqueous Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide).

      "SummaryText": "Aqueous Ammonia is regulated by the State of California at quantities greater than 500 gallons and requires the development of a California Accidental Release Plan (California equivalent to the Federal Risk Management Plan). The Aqueous Ammonia is injected into the water directly from storage tank.\n\nAdministrative control and mitigation measures\n\nCalleguas Staff, in conjunction with design engineers have developed a series of operational, and maintenance checklists and procedures.  These procedures insure the proper operation of the disinfection system.  These procedures insure that the equipment is calibrated, inspected and maintained at the top of safe operational efficiency.\n\nThe system is designed to prevent the release of chlorine and ammonia by including layers of safety.  The chlorine is stored in a concrete block building, located away from and remotely monitored by the 24-hour operations center.  The chlorine storage building has automated valves that will close if a chlorine leak is detected.  The building has a scrubber incorporated into the design of the building. The scrubber is designed to absorb and neutralize approximately 3000 lbs of chlorine gas (1.5 full cylinders).   Distribution of the chlorine gas outside of the scrubber protected building is through buried vacuum pipelines designed to stop the flow of gas if a break occurs in any pipe.  Any break in the distribution piping will break the vacuum distribution system and stop the flow of chlorine gas.  A break in the vacuum distribution system will cause an alarm to be sent to the on-duty operator who will immediately investigate the situation and insure that a release does not occur.\n\nThe ammonia portion of the disinfection system includes the storage tank for the aqueous ammonia and the pumps and piping used to transport and inject the ammonia solution into the chlorinated water.  The storage location provides secondary containment for the aqueous ammonia.  The piping connecting the stored aque"

All information concerning the disinfection process and the detailed engineering design information has been consolidated and is available.

In 1995, Calleguas began using aqueous ammonia to create chloramines used in the disinfection process.  Calleguas has never had an accident having offsite consequences and within the last five years has not had an accident involving chlorine gas or ammonia at this facility.\n\nEmergency response program \n\nCalleguas has a very active emergency response program.  Calleguas is an active member of the Ventura County Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Group.  Through this organization we actively participate with the local Hazardous Materials Response Teams to prepare for emergencies at our facility and provide resources for emergency responses throughout the county.  Together with the local emergency responders, we have had full-scale exercises at our facility to prepare and familiarize the planned responding units with our facility.  These exercises have resulted in the emergency response groups having planned and prepared for an incident at our facility.\n\nChanges planned to improve safety\n\nAll changes recommended in the Process Hazard Analysis and Seismic review are relatively minor and will require only slight"
