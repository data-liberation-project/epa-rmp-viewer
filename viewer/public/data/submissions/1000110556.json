      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION \n\nDiamond Vogel, Inc. is the owner of a new distribution center at N102W19200 Willow Creek Way in Germantown, WI, which has EPA Systems Facility Identifier number 1000 0025 3398. The distribution center intends to store products, including aerosol paint cans. A Program Level 1 Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being submitted in accordance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68 since the maximum quantity of flammables contained in the aerosol products intended to be stored in the distribution center could exceed the applicability threshold and the estimated impacts from the offsite consequence analysis are predicted to not go beyond facility boundaries.  \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nAccidental release prevention is inherent within the design of the distribution center. Aerosol products must be handled appropriately to reduce potential exposure hazards to employees, visitors, and nearby members of the community.  Safe operation is enhanced by the careful manner of handling aerosol products, engineering controls at the facility, and effective training of employees. \n\nFurthermore, the facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan is designed to minimize potential hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous material or hazardous material constituents to air, soil, or surface water.  It also is company policy to comply with Federal and State rules and regulations.   \n\n2. The Facility and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe purpose of the distribution center is to store products, including aerosol paints, for distribution to customers.  Aerosol paints contain Aerosol Grade Propellant with up to 30% propane and 10% butane (by weight) and a solvent that is usually flammable such as acetone. The maximum inventory of flammables that can be stored within the aerosol storage area of the distribution center is 1,800,000 lbs., which as noted above is finished product contained in spray"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThis facility\u0092s systems and practices are designed to achieve compliance with EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule, OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Rule, and with related state and local requirements for prevention of accidental chemical releases. The aerosol storage area was designed and constructed in accordance with the Germantown Fire Prevention Code, which has adopted the 2015 International Fire Code (IFC) and by reference the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 30B Code for the Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products. The aerosol storage area includes safety features such as automatic in-rack fire sprinklers, multiple personnel exits, and self-closing fire doors that would be activated by the heat of a fire. \n\n4. Five-year Accident History \n\nSince this is a new facility, there is no accident history.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Program \n\nThis facility's Emergency Action Plan includes response actions for site personnel for multiple types of emergencies.  The primary elements of the plan include emergency reporting and evacuation procedures, emergency personnel responsibilities, command of responses, training, and site-specific details such as emergency contacts and maps with pertinent locations illustrated.  Facility emergency contacts have provided a copy of this plan to the Germantown Fire Department and the Washington County Emergency Planning Committee.  Note, however, the facility is a non-responding source, meaning it relies on local emergency responders in the event of an accidental release. \n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nSince this is a new facility, it was designed to meet the Germantown Fire Prevention Code, which has adopted the 2015 IFC and by reference the NFPA 30B code. The company\u0092s commitment to its proactive safety policy will be ongoing. Safety improvements will be periodically evaluated and completed i"
