(Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan, Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Title III mandates subtitled the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), and the Occupational Safety and HealthA?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management.)\n\n    AES Warrior Run is one of several plants owned and operated by the AES Corporation, Arlington, Virginia, whose principal domestic business is the operation of cogeneration plants that produce electricity for sale to industrial energy users and utilities.  The location and construction of the AES Warrior Run facility came about through negotiations between AES and Allegheny Power Systems, Inc.  Allegheny Power Systems, Inc. is a public utility holding company engaged in providing electric service in portions of Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.  The AES Warrior Run facility iniated operations in February 2000.\n\n    AES Warrior Run ia 180 megwatt coal-fired cogeneration power plant, which uses the Circulating Fluidizing Bed (CFB) technology.  It is located south of Cumberland, Maryland in Allegany County.  The facility is situated off of Industrial Boulevard (State Route 51) on Mexico Farms Road, S.E. in a forested area of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The area is sparsely populated and is shared with other industrial concerns.  The entire AES Warrior Run facility is fenced with one entrance to the facility, which is currently monitored by security on a 24 hour a day seven (7) days a week basis.\n\n    During the production of electricity, AES Warrior Run uses Anhydrous Ammonia in the facility's selective non-catalytic reduction unit (SNCR) for nitrogen oxide emission"

      "SummaryText": " control.  Warrior Run stores the Anhydrous Ammonia in a 12,000 gallon tank, when filled to capacity the tank could hold 68,255 pounds of Ammonia.  AES Warrior Run has placed an administrative filling limit on the tank of 75% which is 9,000 gallons or 52,000 pounds.  \n\nAES Warrior Run is in compliance with the rule, CAA, Section 112 (r).  In accordance with the plans and procedures, AES performs maintenance inspections, conducts equipment inspections and testing.  The facility also conducts personnel training on equipment use and safety, equipment failure and emergency response, and ensures security at the facility.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted at the AES Warrior Run facility in 2004 and was revalidated in 2009.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\n\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at the AES facility for offsite consequence analysis data.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n    Specific measures are taken to ensure the accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia does not occur:\n\n1.    Maintains/updates procedures for equipment use.\n2.    Conducts personnel training.\n3.    Ensures Maintenance Procedures are followed.\n4.Maintains all maintenance and follow-up records.\n5.    Continues to improve inspections, maintenance and personnel training.\n6.    Monitors ammonia deliveries to ensure procedures are followed.\n\n    \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNote that there has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nTo ensure personnel and public safety, AES Warrior Run maintains and updates Emergency Action Plans/Procedures, including plans/procedures for addressing an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The Emergency Action Plan also has procedures for contacting and coordinating with local emergency response agencies (Allegany County Emergency Management Agency) in the event of an accidental release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility expects to improve safety perf"
