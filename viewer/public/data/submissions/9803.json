The facility complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) -58 requirements for Liquid Propane Gas Storage and Handling, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency accidental release it is the policy of the management of the Bath, SD facility to notify the City of Aberdeen Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Bath, SD Facility stores and handles a variety of products and commodities associated with the production of crops.  Anhydrous ammonia and liquefied propane gas are two (2) products regulated by Part 68 of the CAA and are in use at this facility above regulated quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, for retail sales, is stored in four (4) above ground storage tanks (AST) on concrete cradles.  Two (2) ASTs are 30,000 gallons in capacity (total H20) and two (2) are 18,000 gallons capacity.  Incoming product arrives by semi-bulk truck and rail tank car.  The facility also has seven (7) rail cars of 80 ton capacity each and sixty (60) nurse trailers {15-1,450 gallons and 45-1000 gallons} The maximum inventory, based on 85% of total H20 capacity, is 2,000,000 pounds.  Liquefied propane gas,"

Propane arrives by rail and semi-bulk truck and leaves by semi-bulk truck.  The maximum inventory is 840,000 pounds.\n\n(c) The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: Worst case scenario:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia worst case scenario is the failure of the largest vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (160,000 pounds), resulting in a toxic gas release.  According to Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis documentation, the distance to the endpoint is 7.30 miles.  The estimated residential population within this distance is 28,000 and public receptors include schools, residences, hospitals, prisons/correction facilities, recreation, major commercial, office, or industrial, and agricultural production areas.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: Alternative case scenario:\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia alternative case scenario which reached an endpoint off site is the failure of a vessel {nurse tank} when filled to the greatest amount allowed (6,400 pounds), resulting in a toxic gas release.   EXAMPLE: Tornado or collision shears valve(s) from nurse tank and mitigation devices fail resulting in loss of total vessel capacity.  According to Environmental Protection Agency Offsite Consequence Analysis documentation, the distance to the endpoint is 0.50 miles.  The estimated residential population within this distance is 175 and public receptors include major commercial, office, or industrial, and agricultural production areas.\n\nLiquefied Propane Gas: Worst case scenario:\n\nThe liquefied propane gas worst case scenario is the failure of the largest vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (110,000 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.
