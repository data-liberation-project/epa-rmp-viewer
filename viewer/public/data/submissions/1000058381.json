Waste material is generally received and shipped by the facility via tank truck, box truck, and railcar.\n\n\n\n(a) The facility is committed to the safety of its employees and neighboring community. Facility personnel receive training relevant to preventing hazards and emergency response as provided in the facility's RCRA permit. Topics discussed to prevent hazards include: site access, inspections, location and operation of emergency response equipment, utilization of existing safety measure (e.g., berms, containment), and the handling of incompatible wastes. Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and spills; the Reece City Volunteer Fire Department is the primary responder in the event of a release beyond the incipient stage.\n\n\n\n(b) The facility consists of a liquids fuel blending and drum tipping operation, a liquid/solid waste storage/processing area, an aerosol can processing operation, a railcar loading process, and a drum re-conditioning operation. The liquid fuels blending operation consists of eight 20,000 gallon storage tanks, and is interconnected with piping to the drum tipping operation. The regulated substances potentially handled above their regulated threshold levels in the fuels blending operation include: Acrylonitrile; Allyl Alcohol; Carbon Disulfide; Chloroform; and Vinyl Acetate Monomer.  The aerosol can processing operation consists of an aerosol can crushing system and associated liquid and gaseous content storage tanks/processing equipment.  The regulated substances potentially handled above their regulated threshold levels in the aerosol can processing operation include: Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Dimethyl Ether, and Difluoroethane. No regulated substances are managed above their threshold levels in the liquid/solid waste s"

However, to comply with the general duty clause of Clean Air Act Section 112(b), the facility has established a Management System and Prevention Program using the RMP Level 2 requirements as a guide.  This includes the implementation of the following Prevention Program elements:\n\n\n\n?    Chemical and Process Safety Information\n\n?    Hazard Review\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Maintenance Procedures\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?

Additionally, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of RMP chemicals such that these chemicals are maintained below the RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\n(d) The facility has not experienced a reportable incident under the criteria established during the past five years.\n\n\n\n(e) Facility personnel are trained to respond to incipient fires and releases only and GRR is not considered a \"responding facility\" under the Risk Management Plan regulations.  In addition, the facility has coordinated it response activities with the local response agencies and therefore, is not required to implement an \"Emergency Response Plan\" under the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nHowever, as a RCRA-permitted facility Giant Resource Recovery, Inc. has developed and implemented a Contingency Plan under the Federal RCRA regulations.  This Contingency Plan provides detailed response, notification, reporting, and evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency situation at the facility and consists of the main elements of the RMP Emergency Response Plan requirements.\n\n\n\nEmergency response/contingency plan training includes: notification of appropriate personnel (company and off-site responder); hazardous material identificat"

The facility maintains emergency equipment to use in the event or a fire or release (e.g., personal protective equipment (PPE), spill control equipment). The Reece City Volunteer Fire Department, Etowah County Sheriff's Department, and Baptist Memorial Hospital are part of the emergency response plans for the facility and have been provided copies of the facility's contingency plan.\n\n\n\n(f) The facility provides refresher employee training regularly that incorporates safe handling practices, hazard prevention, and emergency response. The facility also performs monthly safety meetings on various topics taken from suggestions provided by facility employees to improve general site safety and RMP-constituent safety procedures.  With respect to RMP chemical handling, the facility attempts to actively manage the processing of these chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is below the RMP threshold quantities. In the event that the facility receives the chemicals listed above in quantities greater than the RMP thresholds, the facility attempts to manage the chemicals such that the volume of the chemicals is reduced and removed from the site expeditiously. \n\n"
