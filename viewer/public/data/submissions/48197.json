DPS recently purchased the facility from U.S. Borax.  The facility operates one Westinghouse aero-derivative combustion turbine generator (CTG) with a maximum nominal gross output of 53 megawatts (MW) (43 MW electricity plus 10 MW steam).  The CTG burns pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively.  It is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and ammonia injection for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  Anhydrous ammonia is supplied to the SCR from a 12,000-gallon storage tank.  The working capacity of the tank is limited by administrative controls to 85 percent capacity, or approximately 10,500 gallons (approximately 60,400 pounds). \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored and used at the DPS facility of 60,400 pounds exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for regulation under the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 68), the 10,000-pound threshold for regulation under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation (29 CFR 1910.112) and the 500-pound threshold for regulation under the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) RMP program.  DPS has developed this plan to document the plans and programs DPS has in place to comply with these three regulatory programs.\n\nThe storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the DPS facility meets the requirements for a Program Level 3 facility under the federal and CalARP RMP programs, based on the storage of 10,500 gallons (60,400 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia, the potential to impact an off-site public receptor due to the worst-case release of ammonia from the process, and a release of ammonia within the last five years.  The release occurred under prior ownership of the facility and details of the release are not known"

      "FacilityID": 48197,
      "SummaryText": ".  It is estimated that approximately 20 pounds of anhydrous ammonia was released and there are no known offsite consequences attributed to the release.\n\nU.S. Borax had in place a CalARP / RMP plan for the facility when DPS acquired the facility.  DPS has elected to develop a new combined CalARP / RMP / PSM plan that reflects DPSs' plans and procedures, and also reflects the administrative changes such as contact information, responsibility and ownership.  This new plan constitutes a 5-year update of the RMP / PSM plan for the Mojave Cogeneration Company facility.\n\n1.1 Accident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nDPS has a commitment to worker and public safety.  DPS is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner.  DPS has implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  DPS is committed to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment.  DPS management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers to ensure a safe operation.\n\n1.2 Covered Process, Substance, and Quantity\n\nThis combined CalARP / RMP / OSHA PSM plan is for the anhydrous ammonia unloading, storage, and handling process at the DPS facility in Boron, California.  The ammonia is stored in an above ground storage tank and is injected into the SCR systems for the control of NOx emissions from the one CTG at the facility.  The covered chemical is ammonia, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number 7664-41-7.  The tank has a design capacity of 12,000 gallons (61,800 pounds), and an operating capacity due to administrative controls of 10,500 gallons (60,400 pounds).\n\n1.3"

The system has a NOx analyzer and ammonia flow controllers to regulate the flow of ammonia to the SCR.  The ammonia tank has redundant pressure relief valves to ensure safe operation of the tank.  The ammonia tank is a horizontally-oriented cylindrical tank.  The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with anhydrous ammonia.  The tank has a design capacity of 12,000 gallons, and is limited by administrative controls to an operating capacity of 10,500 gallons.  The tank is equipped with a deluge system that will flood the tank (externally)"

Of the 37 elements defined for evaluation, the PHA Team did not identify any scenarios with the three highest criticality rankings of ?Unacceptable?, ?Undesirable?, or ?Acceptable with Controls? which would require mitigation.  Twenty-four elements were rated as ?Acceptable? and 13 had ratings of ?Not a Hazard?.  The PHA Team determined that no additional mitigation was warranted to reduce the risk from these scenarios.\n\n1.5.3 Operating Procedures\n\nThe DPS is a commercial power plant, and as such, has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all of the operations necessary to ensure safe and reliable operation of the facility.  The SOPs constitute a significant volume of written documentation, and the SOPs are routinely evaluated and updated.  The SOPs are incorporated by reference into this RMP / PSM.\n\n1.5.4 Training\n\nThe DPS has implemented a training program for all employees covering the anhydrous ammonia process as required by ?2760.4.  The purpose of the training program is to ensure that highly hazardous chemicals (i.e. ammonia) are handled in a consistent and safe manner and to have operators trained in the safe handling of chemicals at the facility.  An effective training program will help operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from process operations and will increase employee awareness with respect to the hazards involved in handling ammonia.\n\nDPS trains employees using a combination of classroom, on-the-job training, and independent study.  The training program includes initial training, refresher training, documentation, and periodic reviews of effectiveness.  Employees receive general safety training during new employee orientation, including chemical safety-related training programs such as hazard communication and use of personal protective equipment.

DPS requires that contractors be properly trained prior to being allowed onsite, and requires that the contractors undergo site-specific safety training prior to starting work.  The contractor is required to obtain a Hot Work Permit from the Control Room prior to beginning work involving live electricity, pressurized pipelines or other energy-related hazards, and are required to use lock out / tag out and confined space entry procedures, as appropriate.  The contractor is also required to provide training to DPS employees if the contractor brings onsite any chemicals or materials in the course of their work that may expose facility employees to hazards that were not previously onsite.  \n\n1.6 5-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility had a release of anhydrous ammonia on February 1, 2005, prior to its purchase by DPS from U.S. Borax.  The time of the release is unknown.  The release occurred due to a failure of the ammonia relief valve on the ammonia injection skid.  When the leak was discovered, the relief valve was immediately isolated using a block valve upstream.  The faulty relief valve was subsequently replaced.  The release is estimated at 20 pounds of ammonia.  There were no offsite consequences attributed to the release.\n\nThere are no additional known releases from the ammonia process in the last five years.\n\n1.7 Emergency Response Plan\n\nDPSs? Emergency Response Plan includes the following core elements:\n\n* Specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia;\n\n* Procedures "

A copy of the registration is included in Appendix H.\n\n1.10 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDPS has recently conducted a thorough 3-year RMP compliance audit, a thorough safety inspection of the ammonia tank and distribution system, and a comprehensive PHA for the ammonia process.  DPS took corrective action immediately for each deficiency identified in these reviews.  As of the date of preparation of this RMP / PSM plan, there are no outstanding corrective actions.\n\nDuring the development of the OCA for this RMP / PSM, DPS evaluated the potential consequences of a worst-case release of ammonia.  Based on this evaluation, DPS determined that it was necessary to install a containment and water deluge system on the Boron facility anhydrous ammonia tank.  DPS made this decision for three reasons:\n\n1. General industry practice is to install a water deluge system on anhydrous ammonia tanks at power plants.\n\n2. A cont"

The entire town of Boron, including the Fire Department station, is within the significant impact threshold radius for the worst-case spill.\n\n4. The Kern County Fire Department Hazardous Material (HazMat) response team is located in Bakersfield, approximately 90 miles away.  Consequently, there would likely be at least a 1.5 hour response time for arrival of the HazMat team if a release were to occur. \n\nThe deluge system mitigates a release of ammonia by absorbing the ammonia in copious amounts of water.  This will lower the vapor pressure of the ammonia, reduce the evolution of vapor to the atmosphere from the resultant aqueous solution, and spread the duration of the release to atmosphere over a much longer period of time.  This mitigation will effectively lower the concentration of ammonia at offsite receptors.\n\nDPS completed construction of the containment structure and deluge system in December 2006.  The deluge system is designed for a flow rate of 0.25 gallons per minute per square foot of area with a total flow rate requirement of 296.8 gallons per minute.  The containment structure has a capacity of approximately 12,000 gallons and provides containment for the ammonia-saturated deluge water captured by the containment system.  The containment structure limits the surface area of the ammonia solution to the dimensions of the structure, and thereby reduces the release rate of ammonia into the atmosphere (relative to an uncontained pool of ammonia-saturated deluge water), which in turn reduces the resulting ammonia concentration at potential offsite receptors.\n\n\n\n"
