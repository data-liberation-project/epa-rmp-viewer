      "SummaryText": "I.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nDixie Chemical's manufacturing plant is situated on 45 acres in the Bayport Industrial Park, 25 miles southest of Houston, Texas.  As a leading manufacturer of performance chemicals, Dixie's products find a variety of end uses.  Uses include:\n\n     Resins                  Coatings and Printing Inks                     Paper Sixing Chemicals\n     Solvents                Food, Drugs, Cosmetics                       Surfactants\n     Lube Additives       Textiles and Dyes                                 Agricultural Chemicals \n\nContract chemical processing is also a vital part of Dixie Chemical's operations.  Dixie Chemical performs sophisticated custom processing under contracts with other chemical manufacturing companies.\n\nDixie produces products via multi-step synthesis operations that could include:  Centrifugation, Crystallization, Distillation, Drying, Extraction, Mixing, Solvent Exchange, Synthesis Reactions.\n\nDixie utilizes the following toxic materials in sufficient quantities to be included under the U.S. EPA RMP regulations:  Acrylonitrile, Epichlorohydrin, and Propyleneimine.  Dixie also uses the following flammable materials in sufficient quantities to be included in the RMP:  Isoprene and 1,3 butadiene.  Of the chemicals listed above, only Propyleneimine is manufactured at Dixie's Bayport Facility.  It is sold separately and also used as a raw material for another product.  The remainder of the chemicals listed are used as raw materials.\n\nDixie is committed to providing a safe workplace, a clean environment, and continued quality improvements.  All plant operating personnel are required to have classroom instruction as well as equipment specific training prior to being able to independently work in any of the manufacturing areas. A complete hazard review and an operating manual, meeting Process Safety Manual regulations, are in place before starting to make any of our products.

RISK INVOLVEMENT\n\nBecause of the nature of these materials, each of the above chemicals are stored in their own dedicated storage tank. Each of these tanks are located within a spill containment area sufficient to contain the voume of the laregest tank within the respective area along with a six inch rainfall. This insures that spills will not leave Dixie's plant site. Because most of Dixie's manufacturing efforts are scheduled in campaigns, and not continuously, the (raw material) inventories of the above hazardous chemicals are kept at a minimum between campaigns thus reducing the risk associated with these aforementioned chemicals most of the year.\n\nA typical manufacturing operation involves storage of the raw materials in either tanks, tank trailers, or drums; reaction of the raw materials; purification; and packaging of selected product. Inventory of both raw materials, intermediates, and final products are kept at minimum levels to reduce risk.\n\nThe RMP regulations require that risk be assessed assuming that each of the tanks storing hazardous chemicals be considered full and that a spill or leak develops that completely empties the respective tank within ten minutes. Although leaks and spills have ocurred at Dixie, a spill of this magnitude as never happened. Spill containment was taken into account when assessing the following scenarios.  (Personnel actions were assumed to minimize the amount spilled in more likely Alternative Scenarios)\n\nIII.  WORST CASE SCENERIO\n\nWorst case senerios have been completed for Acrylonitrile (toxic) and Isoprene (flammable). In each case, the entire contents of storage containers were emptied into the secondary containment areas. The modeling indicates that maximum impact distance for acrylonitrile and isoprene is less than 1 mile. No residential areas are located in Dixie's Worst Case impact zones.\n\nIV.  ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENERIOS\n\nAltern"

These cases involve scenerios that include tank overfills, leaks in transfer lines, or punctured containers. These scenerios also include the effects of response actions that could be reasonable expected from Dixie's responders. Modeling indicates that the maximum impact distance for Dixie's alternative scenerios is less than 0.2 miles. No residential areas are located within Dixie's alternative case impact zones.\n\nV.  OSHA PSM MEASURES AT DIXIE\n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been underway at Dixie's Bayport plant for over five years. This program which has as its central goal the protection of Dixie's personnel within our plant site has resulted in a safety program which also extends out beyond our plant site to help protect our adjacent industrial and residential neighbors. This PSM program involves the formal reviews of potential process hazards to identify and prevent process accidents prior to and during operations. In Dixie's PSM program regular equipment inspections are conducted. A Management of Change (MOC) program assures that proper equipment and procedures are in place. Prompt and detailed investigations of every safety incident are carried out in order to prevent recurrence. Audits are performed to ensure that the proper manufacturing and safety procedures are followed. The following changes have take place under the PSM program which have reduced incidents ant Bayport: Redundant level devices with high level alarms have been installed. A foam system is available to suppress vapors from spills. Water spray systems for cooling tanks are present in flammable material storage areas.\n\nVI.  ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOne accidential spill occurred at Dixie Chemical which caused injury to an employee within the the past five years.  The employee experienced contact dermatitus.\n\nVII.

      "SummaryText": "NSE PROGRAM\n\nDixie Chemical Company has a fully trained Emergency Response team (ERT). This team consists of volunteers from operations, maintenance, and analytical services. Members of the ERT work on rotating shifts so that immediate help is available should an accident, spill, or other emergency occur. All ERT personnel receive training as specified by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.120, 1910.156, and the National Fire Protection Association standards. Annual refresher training is conducted for all team personnel. Drills are conducted at least annually to certify the current level of readiness of all ERT personnel. Drills are evaluated to verify the proficiency and to identify areas of improvement.\n\nA plant alarm is in place to alert all plant personnel to any emergencies. A community Awareness/Emergency Response (CAER) phone line permits citizens to be informed of drills, emergencies, and other areas of interest. The plant radio network is also used to coordinate the actions during any ERT event.\n\nDixie Chemical is a member of the Channel Industry Mutual Aid organization (CIMA) which provides mutual emergency response from over 50 companies in the event aid is needed. Dixie's ERT participates in area emergency drills with CIMA and the local LEPC. Dixie Chemical has a hurricane preparedness plan that includes shutting down manufacturing activities when hurrican threats are immiment.\n\nVIII.  POSSIBLE CHANGES TO REDUCE RISK\n\nDixie's product mix changes routinely, due to the nature of batch specialty chemical processing. Due to the changing nature of speciality chemicals business, Dixie will continue to employ proper chemical handling methods, maintain secondary containment systems, and minimize chemical inventories."
