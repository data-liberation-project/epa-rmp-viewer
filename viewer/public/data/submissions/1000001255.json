      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Port Townsend is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of a release, we have arranged with Jefferson County Department of Emergency Management and local fire departments to provide emergency response coordination and will request CHLOREP emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nChlorine gas is used in the water treatment process for disinfection of the public water supply.  The maximum inventory at the City Lake facility is 12,600 lbs.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe City of Port Townsend maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameter and equipment designs associated with the water treatment process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a r"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the City of Port Townsend maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Port Townsend has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating the process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe City of Port Townsend carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper function.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; cylinders, piping systems, relief and vent systems, monitoring equipment, regulators, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place for the City Lake facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators/maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety"

There reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe City of Port Townsend conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWhile the City of Port Townsend has never had a catastrophic release, it will promptly investigate any incident that resulted in, or could result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe City of Port Townsend believes that the process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  City employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation to the RMP rule.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the City hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The City of Port Townsend has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractorA?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Cit"
