Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\n\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) interprets this regulation as any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedu"

The Duty Manager and the Project Manager are to be called if not on site for support.  Releases less than 50 PPM shall result in immediately calling the Duty Manager and the Project Manager, if not on site, for instructions.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review SCR process equipment on an ongoing basis.  These procedures identify potential sources of releases and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite technicians, registered engineers, SCR process experts, and certified process contractors review the equipment as required.\n\n\n\nThere are full time managers and operational employees such as technicians at this facility that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) prevention program.  \n\n\n\n (b) STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) facility at 73396 Tower Road, Boardman, OR., utilizes anhydrous ammonia for NOx emission reduction. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may displace oxygen. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeat or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, serious skin burn, and even death.  Safety Data Sheet's (SDS) are provided for anhydrous ammonia in the appendix. The SDS provides information on; toxicit"

(Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the SCR process.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., flooding, extreme weather, etc.).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) management.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Maintenance Elements.\n\n\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the SCR process should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Maintenance, and Incident Investigation Elements.) \n\n\n\n4) Certification of process operators (technicians) to safely operate the SCR process. Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) certifies technicians following completion of Level I training and Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station)'s confirmation of the technician's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, SCR process operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident"

Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation and Training Elements)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station)'s program.\n\n \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for a change in maintenance contracts, Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \n\n\n\n7) Verification of Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station)'s compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This third party audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the program have been implemented and properly documented by Portland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) personnel.

Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the RMP/PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\n\n\n\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and the LEPC.\n\n\n\nSee the Prevention Program Employee Participation Tab 10 for the complete guidelines. The supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Control Room.\n\n\n\nHot Work and Safe Work Practices\n\nThis permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done. The management reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nSee the Prevention Program Hot Work Tab 11 for the complete guidelines. The supporting and completed documents are filed and maintained in the Control Room.\n\n\n\nContractors and Contractor Qualifications\n\nThis site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the SCR process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\n\n\nSee the Prevention Program Contractor Tab 12 f"

The facilities emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. \n\n\n\nThe facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills and tabletop exercises.  Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency.  In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facility during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and/or a chemical release.\n\n\n\nPlans have been developed to assist responding personnel.  All areas (zones) can reasonably be brought under control within 20 minutes of an ammonia emergency if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area, the SCR process may be shut down if appropriate at the DCS control computer.  \n\n\n\nPortland General Electric (Carty Generation Station) technicians are trained in the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and ammonia specific, stationary and portable air monitoring equipment, decontamination, clean up and disposal.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Regulations considered while "
