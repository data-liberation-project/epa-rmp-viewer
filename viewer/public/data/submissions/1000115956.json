Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant's PSM and accidental release prevention programs. These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs. In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include facility safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, as well as equipment design basis and configuration information. Personnel from Steel Reef's corporate operations support team, Steel Reef Safety Team, and in conjunction with facility personnel, are assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the gas plant's operating procedures, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).

Steel Reef has adopted and will follow certain existing plant specific procedures previously developed by ORM, in particular the plant's operating procedures, including start-up and shut down procedures. Steel Reef will apply applicable corporate policies and procedures that it has already developed as outlined below, including for example, its management of change and incident investigation procedures. Since RMP*Comp modeling indicates that the Lignite Facility exceeds the 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case scenario at approximately 0.9 miles and public receptors are within this radius, Steel Reef does not meet the criteria to be classified as Program Level 1. Since Steel Reef does not meet either criterion for Program Level 3, Steel Reef is presumptively classified as Program Level 2. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nSteel Reef has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities and processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. If a release does occur, facility personnel are trained and will respond to control and contain the release.

We take the lead in developing, implementing, monitoring and continuously improving comprehensive health and safety plans to strive for an accident-free workplace and to achieve high health, safety and environmental performance.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant, located near Lignite, North Dakota, uses lean oil absorption, amine absorption, and fractionation to process sour wellhead gas into marketable products, namely natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., propane, butane, pentane, and y-grade). There is approximately 1,600,000 lbs of flammable product stored in the storage process vessels on site. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in the Program Level 2 processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). Following EPA\u0092s guidance on co-located vessels, it was found that if a WCS would occur at the Lignite Gas Plant that the resulting explosion could release material from all eight of the vessels. Using substance amounts from Table 1: Worst-Case Scenario 1 psi distance and EPA\u0092s RMP*Comp software, a maximum distance to 1-psi endpoint was found to be 0.9 mi. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for administrative controls for maintaining a maximum of 80% level in the tank were considered in evaluating this WCS. According to echo.epa.gov, there are 129 people that would be impacted within the"

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Steel Reef primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study technique to perform these evaluations on its gas plant. The analysis is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs. Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary or would improve hazard management. The PHA team findings are addressed locally and by the company's Operations and Engineering teams for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls an"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (i) unit startup, (ii) normal operations, (iii) temporary operations, (iv) emergency shutdown, (v) normal shutdown, and (vi) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, Lignite Gas Plant's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to specific process or equipment parameters that exceed the established safe upper and lower limits.  Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lignite Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate knowledge to perform"
