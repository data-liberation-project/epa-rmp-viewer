      "SummaryText": "This facility, South Coles Levee Gas Plant, was built in the 1940's.  It is a remote facility regulated by the CalOSHA Process Safety Management Program,  Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189.  The facility is in compliance with this regulation and maintains a prevention program described below.  The South Coles Levee Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  The prevention program exceeds the requirements of this regulation and consists of the following components:  Injury and Illness Prevention Program, General Safety Rules, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Permit, and Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  The Mechanical Integrity part of the prevention program includes ultrasonic testing of process lines and vessels.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management audits every three years and revalidation of the process hazard analysis every five years.  The last revalidation was October 1998.  The plant is functionally divided into three sections:  Gas Plant, Compression Storage, and Refridgeration Skid.  The main function of the facility is to extract liquid hydrocarbons and prepare produced gas for sales.  The liquified petroleum gasoline liquids are stored in"

      "SummaryText": " vessels of various sizes, the largest being 80,000 gallons.  Operational Services, Inc. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with the local emergency response agencies.  The facility has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department-Certified Unified Program Agency.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.  Based on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 California Code of Regulations 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release in the last 5 years.  The worst case scenario of 389,645 pounds of liquified petroleum gasoline liquids, is based on the Environmental Protection Agency model.  The scenario indicates a 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance does not impact public receptors.  This is a remote facility.  All visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  While no other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating the alternative release scenario, the process dow have relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, process alarms, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices."
