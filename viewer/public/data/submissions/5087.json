The program includes a weekly visual check of plumbing/pumps/air lines and tanks for possible leaks.  The crane/hoist system/baskets are checked weekly for defects to prevent the possibility of a basket falling into a tank and causing damage that may result in a leak or injury to a worker.  The water supply is checked weekly to insure the water pressure is sufficient in the event of an emergency.  The pH sensor is re-standardized weekly to insure it properly records the acid concentration in the tanks. Any item needing repair is immediately reported to the maintenance supervisor and given high priority.  The chem mill operator uses a checkoff sheet to prevent missing any necessary item on the weekly check.  \n\nProper equipment is provided to the area for transporting drums of acid.\n\nAll new employees in the area receive training on the proper procedures for working with acid and working with the equipment in the area.",

As such, we plan to continue and reinforce the policies and procedures implemented by the previous owners of the facility. MPMs main goal is to train employees and implement programs to prevent all accidental spills and to provide employees with adequate training for quick emergency response in the event of a natural disaster which may increase the amount of hydrofluoric acid vapors dispersed in the air.\n\nMPM is a producer of titanium castings and ingot.  A process within our manufacturing operations involves the chemical etching of titanium metal.  Hydrofluoric acid is an ingredient of the chemical etching solution. The maximum concentration of hydrofluoric acid in the solution is 6%, but normally runs at 4%. The total quantity in all tanks in the process is 1,000 lbs, with the largest individual tank holding approximately 325 lbs.  In addition, we have an inventory of up to three 55-gallon drums of 70% hydrofluoric acid.  \n\nIn order to reduce potential for harm to our employees and the community, all employees working in the area are thoroughly trained in acid handling.  A specially designed storage area for the 55-gallon drums, which includes secondary containment, provides additional safety for the community.\n\nThe tanks used for the etching solution are specially designed and manufactured for this process.  The entire system for this process is built within a secondary containment area and is covered by a roof. Equipment is inspected weekly for signs of corrosion and leaks.  Written procedures for the area are reviewed, and updated as necessary, on a annual basis or whenever a change to the process occurs.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of hydrofluoric acid since MPM purchased the facility in February, 1999.  The records from the previous owners indicate that no release has occurred within the last fi"

In fact, there is no record in the files of there ever being an accidental release at this facility.  \n\nOn doing an analysis of several possible scenarios for the accidental release of hydrofluoric acid, the one event that appears to present the most hazard to the community would be the spilling of an entire 55-gallon drum of 70% hydrofluoric acid in the open on a concrete slab.  The off-site impact would extend up to .3 of a mile and includes no residential areas. Several businesses, including employees at the SPADRA landfill, would also be affected by such a release.  \n\nSince human error would be the most likely cause for this type of accidental release, MPM is committed to ensuring that each employee that is involved in moving the acid is thoroughly trained and is provided with proper equipment.  Forklift training is an integral part of this process.  \n\nAs an alternative accidental release scenario, we concluded that cracking of the largest chem mill tank would present the next largest hazard to the community and would be more likely to occur than the drum spillage. The off-site impact would extend up to .2 of a mile and include no residential areas.  Several businesses, including employees at the SPADRA landfill, would also be affected by such a release.\n\nA spill from the largest tank would be completely contained in the pit  within the secondary containment area.  There is enough room in the containment area to increase the water percentage and thus decrease the hydrofluoric acid concentration of the spill.  In addition, MPM has a system for neutralizing spent acid.  The acid from any accidental spill in this area can be pumped to the neutralization storage tank or directly to the neutralization tank, reducing the possibility of harm to the community.  \n\nTo minimize hazards to the community, MPM has established an emergency response program based on the previous facility owners plan.  This plan includes responsibilities and procedures to handle the "
