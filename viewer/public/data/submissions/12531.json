This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n7 A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n7 A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n7 An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n7 A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n7 An overview of our emergency response program\n7 An overview of recent improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nOur facility uses Ethylene Oxide, Propylene Oxide, Methylamine, and Formaldehyde to produce a wide variety of soaps, detergents, dyes, and agricultural products for use in consumer and industrial products.  The EPA has identified these chemicals as having the potential to cause adverse offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario (as defined by the EPA) and alternative release scenarios for our facility.

A railcar holds 180,000 pounds of liquid ethylene oxide. The evaporating ethylene oxide could potentially reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  The site has implemented a process safety management system, including railcar inspection, security, physical barriers and unloading procedures intended to prevent this type of incident from occurring.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Methylamine\n\nOur worst-case flammable release scenario is complete failure of the methylamine storage tank and all our safety systems. The methylamine tank holds 80,000 pounds of liquid methylamine. The evaporating methylamine could be involved in a vapor cloud explosion, however, according to the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, the effects would not reach public receptors.  The site has implemented a process safety management system, including tank inspection, security, physical barriers and operating procedures, intended to prevent this type of incident from occurring.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Ethylene Oxide\n\nOne RMP alternative release scenario involves the rupture of an ethylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,930 pounds of ethylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, ethylene oxide released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.6 miles of the facility.  The public receptors that could be impacted by such a release are nearby residences. The site has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and scheduled replacement o"

Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, the effects of this methylamine release would not impact public receptors. Again, the site has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and scheduled replacement of unloading hoses to prevent this type of scenario from occurring.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Formaldehyde\n\nA third RMP alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a formaldehyde piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 123,000 pounds of  formaldehyde into a dike over a period of 50 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use on-site emergency response equipment to reduce the effects of such a release.  Per the EPA's off-site consequence analysis software, formaldehyde released in this scenario could impact public receptors within 0.06 miles of the facility.  The public receptors that could be impacted by such a release are nearby residences.  The Mt. Holly Plant has implemented a process safety management program that includes inspection and operating procedures to prevent this type of scenario from occurring.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Propylene Oxide\n\nOur last alternative release scenario involves the rupture of a propylene oxide piping connection, resulting in the release of approximately 15,400 pounds of propylene oxide over a period of 45 minutes.   Our on-site emergency response team would use automatic and manually operated valves to stop such a release.

However, we have a system in place to investigate and keep records of significant incidents, including accidental chemical releases that might occur at our site.

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Our plan also includes specific procedures for responding to a release of RMP chemicals.
