      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical, Manufacturing and Oil Refining Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Mid-State Chemicals are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Industrial Chemical Distribution.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used for water purification and waste treatment.  Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is used for water purification.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Outside Storage Area.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from the Outside Storage"

      "SummaryText": " Area.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by water curtain(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of controlling the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 2.4 miles.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from the Outside Storage Shed.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by water curtain(s) and Emergency Kits.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of controlling the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.43 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
