Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, RB Sandrini has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 RB Sandrini, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that RB Sandrini has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nNorth System                  Anhydrous Ammonia                18,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The south system control valves are located alongside the building (elevated). The refrigeration machinery for each system is contained within each machinery room.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia evaporates to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver or directly to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tanks if the pressure in the sys"

Each box contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere or the diffusion tanks. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nEach of the ammonia systems at RB Sandrini consists of vessels, valves, equipment which are interconnected by piping to form a closed-loop. The systems are neither interconnected nor co-located in respect to each other.\n\n\n\nRAGAGEP Statement\n\nThe process equipment was inspected during the PHA for the purpose of verifying that the process was designed, fabricated, and is being operated in accordance with applicable industry standards. In the judgment of the PHA team, the North System (Process 1) was designed and installed in accordance with the 1997 UMC. This judgment was made based on the date of the nameplates (2000) and documentation provided by CalCA regarding the ventilation system design.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear which codes and standards were followed in the design and construction of the South System (Process 2). In the judgment of the PHA team, the South System most closely aligns with ANSI/IIAR 74-2 - 1978. This judgement was made because of the following:\n\n- System lacks an ammonia diffusion tank\n\n- Age of the facility/system (Oil Separator nameplate is dated 1985)\n\n- Lack of documentation specifying codes and standards used at the facility\n\n\n\nIn 2017, CalCA was hired to replace the evaporators and vessels in Room 4.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nRB Sandrini has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the RB Sandrini facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

Nevertheless, RB Sandrini continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved RB Sandrini's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that RB Sandrini's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nRB Sandrini has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date.
