Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk\r\nManagement Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).  Batesville is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119);. Upon completion of modeling, Smith & Burgess found there were off-site receptors identified using EPA MARPLOT that could be impacted by the RMP scenarios. Therefore, Batesville is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in US EPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by US EPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\r\n\r\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\nBatesville employs one (1) full-time employee on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  Batesville maintains a policy of safe condensate handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  Batesville has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release.

Therefore, Batesville is classified as a Program 3 Facility. The processes at the plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The plant boundaries of the stationary source begin at the pig receiver at the plant inlet and end at the pig launcher plant discharge just after the 10\" block valve tied to ESD-3000. This plant is designed to receive natural gas from a pipeline. The gas process begins with inlet separation to remove any pipeline liquids. These \"Y-Grade\" liquids are stabilized as a condensate to remove any materials that are not atmospheric stable liquids, sent to storage and can then be trucked off\r\nsite. The remaining gas is then compressed to pipeline pressures and goes through a dehydration process to ensure most of the water is removed from the gas before being exported offsite.  The Batesville Compressor Station was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or\r\ntoxic substances exceeded a defined threshold quantity. The listed flammable substances that are stored above threshold quantities at Batesville are natural gas, unstabilized condensate, stabilized condensate, and natural gas liquids. The flammable components of these substances include methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and heavier alkanes.
