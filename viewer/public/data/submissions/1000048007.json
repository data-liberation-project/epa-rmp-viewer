      "SummaryText": "The Andersons, Inc.\r\nLitchfield Farm Center \r\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\r\n\r\nSource and Product Description\r\nThe Andersons Litchfield Farm Center is engaged in the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies.  This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since 1986. Site manager's name and emergency contact information is posted on a sign at the facility entrance.\r\n\r\nThe facility occupies approximately 14 acres and is located just north of the village of Litchfield, in Litchfield Township, Hillsdale County, Michigan.  The facility is situated on the southeast corner of M99 (Homer Rd.) and Mosherville Rd. Surrounding neighbors include six houses to the west across M99 and to the north.  A golf course lies directly across the street and there are two residences to the east.  Remaining adjacent land is agricultural.\r\n\r\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. This tank is on the east side of the facility, away from any buildings.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also owns 54 nurse tanks which hold 4,000 pounds each of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards\r\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a deliver"

Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\r\n\r\nTransfers from the bulk storage tanks to the nurse wagon loading station occur inside fixed steel pipes and are manually controlled.  Flexible hoses are used to connect from the loading station to the nurse wagons. \r\n\r\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank(s).  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\r\n\r\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks  are performed by certified welders.  \r\n\r\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\r\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Litchfield Farm Center are:\r\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a delivery truck or nurse wagon were to move before properly disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at a safe connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require"

      "SummaryText": "human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Litchfield Farm Center are:\r\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\r\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the truck unloading riser and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to the truck from the storage tank.\r\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tank and fixed steel piping to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\r\n\u00bf  Emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the 30,000 gallon bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\r\n\u00bf  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a large water tank to the north.  A nearby water well (100' to the east) could be utilized to provide water to knock down a vapor cloud.\r\n\u00bf  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\r\n\u00bf  Anderson personnel and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.
