However, the facility is not used for treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste.  Therefore, the Miami Plant is presently covered under OSHAA?s Emergency Action Plan 29 CFR 1910.38(a), OSHAA?s HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EPAA?s  RMP Emergency Response rule 40 CFR 68.95.

Miami Plant and Corporate personnel developed and maintain a plan that defines Flexible Foam employee actions during various types of emergencies.  The plan is reviewed periodically and amended to keep it current.\n\n    *    EAP content - The EAP and associated procedures are directed at handling: \n\n        (1)    small chemical releases, \n        (2)    small incipient fires that can be easily extinguished, \n        (3)    personnel injuries and illnesses requiring first aid or emergency medical treatment, \n        (4)    weather-related emergencies\n\n        For major fires, large hazardous chemical releases, and/or explosions, the EAP addresses: \n\n        (1)    rapid assessment of the emergency,\n        (2)    notification of the public and appropriate offsite emergency response agencies, \n        (3)    containment of a fire or release from a safe distance, \n        (4)    employee and/or public evacuation, and \n        (5)    site security and control\n\n \n        The EAP also addresses the use of emergency response equipment as well as the inspection, testing, and maintenance of such equipment.

Selected operations and maintenance employees receive first responder operations level training and Miami Plant management receives on-scene incident commander training that meets the regulatory training requirements of HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120(q), and EAP 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Both groups receive annual refresher training that is coordinated using a site-specific Incident Command System (ICS).  Employees who do not directly participate in emergency response activities, visitors, and all contract employees receive annual training on the EAP.  Employees and contract employees are retrained when the EAP changes, prior to implementation of the changes\n\n    *    Emergency drills - The Miami Plant has offered to conduct emergency drills in conjunction with offsite emergency response agencies to help ensure that employees, contractors, and the public will react appropriately to true emergency situations.  Following emergency drills, Miami Plant management and offsite emergency response participants critique the performance of all personnel and alter the plan and/or training to address any perceived deficiencies\n\n    The H.R./Safety/Environmental Coordinator implements and maintains the ERP Program.

For each activity, the roles of key organizations and/or staff members are described.  These responsibilities are summarized in Appendix 8A.  Appendix 8B summarizes locations of referenced documents/records and lists the people responsible for maintaining that information.\n\n\n\n8.2.1  Emergency Action Plan Development\n\nFlexible Foam Products developed and revise the EAP and other procedures associated with emergency response.  The committee reviews regulatory and company requirements to (1) evaluate existing Miami Plant emergency procedures, (2) identify existing practices that need to be documented with written procedures, and (3) define new practices, procedures, and training requirements that are necessary to meet Flexible FoamA?s ERP objectives.\n\n    Flexible Foam Products, Inc. developed the EAP to address: \n\n    (1)    small chemical releases, \n    (2)    small incipient fires that can be easily extinguished, \n    (3)    personnel injuries and illness requiring first aid or emergency medical treatment, and \n    (4)    weather-related emergencies.  \n\n    The Miami Plant does not have a fire brigade.

The Miami Plant H.R./Safety/Environmental Coordinator is responsible for providing any additional information that those organizations request.  The agencies are offered the opportunity to participate in our annual drills and any other emergency-related training that is appropriate.
