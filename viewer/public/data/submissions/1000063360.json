Two entrepreneurs opened Albemarle, Tyrone Plant for business in 1976.  In 1986, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant was bought by First Chemical Company of Pascagoula, MS.  First Chemical Company is a subsidiary of First Mississippi Corporation, who was restructured under the name of ChemFirst Inc. in late 1996. Albemarle Corporation purchased the site in July of 2001. \n\n\n\nThe facility is designed for maximum flexibility and is continuously upgraded to ensure safe operation, minimal waste, and top efficiency.  We have more than 80,000 gallons of reactor capacity and a complete range of solids handling equipment.  The plant is especially well equipped for complex, multi-step synthesis.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant's production operations consist of the batch production of specific and finite campaigns to produce chemicals for our customers.\n\n\n\nThe facility's Quality and Environmental management systems are ISO 9001 (Quality) and RC 14001 (Environmental and Safety) registered.\n\n\n\nFACILITY POLICIES FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE\n\n\n\nCompany environmental and safety/health policy statements stress the importance of protecting the safety and health of our employees as well as that of the community and the public.  \"The world's natural resources of air, water, and land are finite and must be conserved and protected.

These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: anhydrous ammonia, 77,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde 40,000 pounds; diethyl ether 40,000 pounds; 24% ammonia (ammoniate) 278,000 pounds, and chlorine 22,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a gas delivered by truck and maintained in pressurized tanks, while aqueous ammonia is a liquid that is stored in an atmospheric tank.  Diethyl ether and formaldehyde are stored in tanker trucks, and chlorine is stored in one ton cylinders.    In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for ammonia, formaldehyde, aqueous ammonia, ethyl ether, and chlorine.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some of the releases have off-site impact. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia for the worst-case scenario the pressurized tanks leaks and releases 77,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia  (the entire contents of the pressurized tank) in 10 minutes.  This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\nFor diethyl ether the tanker fails and releases 40,000 pounds of diethyl ether (the entire contents of the tanker) in 10 minutes. A vapor cloud explosion occurs. This scenario DOES NOT take into account the plant's safety and prevention systems, and assumes nothing is done to minimize the release.\n\n\n\nFor 37% formaldehyde solution, a tanker fails causes the release of 40,000 pounds.  The liquid spills into a diked area and evaporates over 10 minutes. "

The Engineering and Safety Departments conduct periodic evaluations of the safety programs and performance for each contractor company.\n\n\n\nPre-Start-up Safety Review:  A series of checklists are developed and implemented to ensure that all appropriate items are reviewed before projects are started.  The Production Project Coordinator develops a list of recommendations from the PHA, and the recommendations are resolved before the project is started.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  The R&M Department has developed Standard Operating Procedures for Preventive Maintenance, and personnel are assigned to conduct the various PM items.  The PM system is also a part of the ISO 9001 and 14001 systems, and these systems are each audited by third party auditors.  The R&M Department conducts an annual shutdown each year in which additional equipment is inspected and/or tested.  Certain equipment may also be inspected and/or tested by contractors.  The R&M Department has developed and implemented a quality assurance program for various types of equipment to ensure that replacement parts meet initial design requirements (replacement in kind).\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit:  The Safety Department has developed and implemented a Hot Work Permit, which is used by all Albemarle, Tyrone Plant and contractor employees.  Other permits (i.e., Line Breaking, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, Safe Work, Elevated Work, and Non-routine Work) are also implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement "

The Engineering Department develops relief system design using a computer program and often customer recommendations.  The R&D Department develops material balances for the reactions.  The Engineering Department generates a list of safety systems and engineering controls (i.e., interlocks, pressure relief devices, computer alarms and controls), which are used during a project.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Production Project Coordinator, Safety Department, Engineering, Production, and Customer representatives conduct a Process Hazard Analysis for each project under the direction of Tyrone's Process Safety Advisor.  Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9001 and 14001.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.  The batch records are used as operating instructions for production operators.  The Production Department develops procedures for emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup after an emergency; these are maintained in the control room.  The R&D Department also generates limits for temperature and pressure that are incorporated into the batch records.  The Safety Department reviews the SDS for each raw material and product, and the information is put into a batch record safety sheet, which uses a standard format to make it easier for operators to locate needed information.  Raw material and product specifications are developed to maintain materi"

If a change is needed for a project, a member of the Project Team initiates an MOC Procedure, and the appropriate personnel review the MOC.  The MOC is maintained in our Lotus Notes Database, and the MOC is also tracked in our computer network.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure:  The Production Shift Supervisor or building Foreman generates the initial incident report following any accident, incident, or close call.  An investigation is held to identify root causes and to propose corrective actions.  These suggestions are added to a computer tracking system where they monitored until they are resolved.  Information is shared with appropriate employees at the plant and at other company locations.\n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response:  The Safety and Environmental Departments have developed several emergency response plans for the site.  Training and drills are conducted to ensure the plans are understood and followed.\n\n\n\nAudits:  Process Hazard Analyses are conducted prior to each new campaign, and at least every five years for repetitive projects which last more than five years.  Batch records are continuously reviewed and updated to ensure they are accurate and the production employees are following them.  The Corporate Safety Department conducts a compliance audit at least every three years to certify compliance with the PSM standard.\n\n\n\nTrade Secrets:  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant does not claim any trade secrets.    \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSeveral plans and procedures address emergency planning and response for the entire plant as well as procedures for handling localized releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated to reflect any facility changes, and is coordinated with the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is"

Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.  Drills are conducted at least twice/year for each crew's response personnel.  The safety department determines the scenario for each drill.  After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\n\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of hand held fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.  In addition to this emergency response training, all employees are instructed to activate the fire alarm and to evacuate the facility in the event of an emergency.    \n\n\n\nWe also utilize the emergency fire and medical response services provided by the City of Tyrone emergency response personnel; response time to our facility is about five (5) minutes.  We provide periodic orientation and informational tours for off-site response personnel.  These training sessions are often conducted in conjunction with the addition of new equipment and/or a new chemistry to the facility.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency Response Teams also conduct training and emergency response drills"

The 2011 Blair County drill was conducted at Albemarle, Tyrone Plant; it involved a spill resulting in operations folks passed out and required extraction.  In 2008, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant participated in a chlorine release drill with Blair County Emergency Responders; this scenario is similar to the chlorine worst-case release scenario identified in this plan.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSeveral changes are being planned to help improve safety.  Additional members of response teams will be trained at the Indiana County Fire School to fight interior fires.  First Responder training has been completed by several employees, our intention is to send additional employees to First Responder training.  Another county wide drill is being planned for October 2017.  In addition, on a routine basis, we assess the effectiveness of many of our plans, programs, and activities; and develop and implement action plans to address any deficiencies.\n\n"
