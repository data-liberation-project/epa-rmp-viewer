This policy extends to all tenants, employees, and contractors at the facility.  Shetakis Civic Center LLC implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.  The facility is coordinated with the local fire department, who will be the facility's emergency responder.\n\n\n\nShetakis Civic Center LLC owns the facility at 3840 North Civic Center Drive and has developed management programs to assist tenants with the implementation of the risk-related regulations associated with operating an ammonia refrigerated warehouse.  Depending on the tenant, the PSM/RMP/CAPP programs may be implemented by different job titles and in slightly differing manners.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Cold Storage Solutions, Shetakis Wholesalers, and Farm Fresh occupy refrigerated spaces within the Shetakis Civic Center LLC facility.  Cold Storage Solutions is responsible for the overall maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system and the PSM/RMP/CAPP Programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Shetakis Civic Center facility provides cold storage warehouse space for distribution and for private tenants.

The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 21,300 pounds of ammonia for warehouse cold storage and food processing.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nThe system is also equipped with a dilution tank (DT-1) and an Emergency Control Box.  All of the relief valves are set to vent at 250 psig and discharge into a common header that vents into the bottom of the dilution tank, which is kept full of water.  In addition, the pressure in the system can be reduced manually by the valving located inside the Emergency Control Box located outside the Engine Room door. This control box allows the Fire Department to transfer ammonia from one vessel to another or vent the ammonia into the water dilution tank.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Shetakis Civic Center LLC ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Shetakis Civic Center LLC facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\n\n\nThe Shetakis Civic Center LLC facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requireme"

These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility (including previous ownership) over the past five years (February 2011 - February 2016) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In September of 2014, there was an incident of a discovered pinhole leak in the AU-11 evaporator in the blast freezer at the neighboring tenant facility at Farm Fresh Foods. Shetakis Wholesalers had an incident of a bullseye sight glass leak in July 2014, where the bullseye sight glass was repaired. The 2014 Farm Fresh Foods and Shetakis incidents were discussed at the February 2-3, 2016 PHA where each occurrence was noted within the PHA report.  In addition, there have been no on-site injuries, deaths or significant property damage, or known offsite injuries, deaths, property damage, or sheltered-in-place resulting from an ammonia release.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe tenants at Shetakis Civic Center LLC have an emergency action plan in effect.

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CAPP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia release emergency, the current tenants plan to evacuate all employees stationed in the cold storage warehouse and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).
