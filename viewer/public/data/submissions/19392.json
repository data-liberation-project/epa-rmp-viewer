SOCO-Lynch's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb.    This RMP has been prepared to address the handling of the following federal Regulated Substances at its facility located at 10747 Patterson PLace, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670:-\n\n    -  Hydrofluoric Acid\n    -  Ammonia solution\n    -  Formaldehyde solution\n\nc.    Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) is received by tank truck and transferred to a storage vessel which operates at roughly atmospheric pressure. From here it is transferred by gravity to fill totes and drums. The drums and totes are stored and supplied to customers. The worstcase release scenario which was modeled was the release of the entire contents of the storage vessel into its containment area. The alternate release scenario modeled was the unconfined release of the contents of a 55 gallon drum. This event was selected based on the findings of the Process Hazard Analysis. No credit was taken for any secondary containment or other measures to prevent and/or mitigate such an incident. There are offsite consequences associated with both release scenarios.\n\nd.    Ammonia solution is received by tank truck and transferred to an atmospheric storage tank. From here it is transferred by pump to fill totes and drums.

The alternate release scenario modeled was the unconfined release of the contents of a 55 gallon drum. This event was selected based on the findings of the Process Hazard Analysis. No credit was taken for any secondary containment or other measures to prevent and/or mitigate such an incident. No public receptor is impacted by such a release.\n\nf.    SOCO-Lynch has a comprehensive release prevention program meeting RMP and PSM requirements. Physical safeguards to prevent a release include the installation of remotely actuated valves. Storage tanks and drum fillers are located within containment dikes designed to hold the entire contents of the largest tank. All transfer and filling operations follow strict and comprehensive written procedures. Operations are constantly attended. Equipment, instrumentation and piping (including transfer hoses) are subject to rigorous inspection and preventative maintenance policies and procedures.\n\ng.    There have been no accidents to report under the 5-year Accident History Component of the RMP.\n\nh.    SOCO-Lynch has a well-manned and well-equipped Hazmat Emergency Response Team which can respond quickly yet safely to spills and other incidents. All team members are trained and certified in accordance with federal/Cal-OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response requirements by the California Specialized Training Institute (CSTI). SOCO-Lynch coordinates with the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department (SFSFD) in order to be able to respond jointly to hazardous materials emergencies. \n\ni.    This is a new state-of-the art facility which has only recently become operational. Numerous safety features including detection systems, emergency shutdown systems and deluge systems were incorporated into the design of the facility and therefore no significant changes are planned to improve safet"
