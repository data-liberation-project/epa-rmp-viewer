The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 3361 South Boxford Avenue, Commerce, CA 90040.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 40,000 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing milk products.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide refrigeration for the production of milk products and storing food products.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nVons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products had prepared and implemented a PSM program in 1995.  This included conducting an initial PHA to examine potential release scenarios and identify measures to reduce the consequences and/or likelyhood of such events.  The PSM prevention programs included developing written operating and maintenance procedures as well as other policies and programs to manage the handling of ammonia at the facility (Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Employee Training, and Participation, etc.) \nThe mechanical rooms are equipped with am"

The facility is equipped with emergency shut off buttons located in the main office, outside the maintenance room, and outside the Ice Cream plant.  Spill containment kits are located throughout the facility.  The facility is also equipped with a sprinkler system.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history at this facility within the past five years (June 1999 to May 2004).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nVons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has an emergency action plan in the Business Plan for the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency.   Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.  The public address system and blow horns will be used in the event that individual contact can not be made.  Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Los Angeles County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRecommendations made during the initial Process Hazard Analysis on May 24, 1995 provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products facility.  Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has implemented these recommendations and have deemed them complete.  Since the initial PHA was conducted in 1995, there have been several major changes to the plant's ammonia refrigeration system, including the decommissioning of the ice cream plant and related refrigeration systems. \n\nOn April 27th and 28th, 2004 a new PHA was conducted at Jerseymaid Milk. The new PHA consolidated all of the various changes and upgrades to the refrigeration system into a single new study. The new PHA generated 30 recommendations.\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " plant maintenance department and Corporate Safety / Environmental staff are working together to close these recommendations on or before Dec 30, 2004.\n\nVons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products has reviewed the following sections of their PSM program and updated them for compliance with the RMP: operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response plan (updating phone list), training, and process safety information.    In addition, the following policies have been prepared in order to comply with the RMP: Recordkeeping and Updates, Management Programs, and Certification.  Finally, additional technical studies (Seismic Assessment, External Events, and a Hazard Assessment) have been prepared to further examine potential causes and consequences associated with a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  \n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  The management at Vons Company, Inc., Jerseymaid Milk Products is planning to continue with this program as follows:\n\n1.  Continued maintenance program for ammonia refrigeration equipment to ensure ongoing integrity of the equipment.\n\n2.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management.\n\n3.   Continue to have employee involvement in safety development.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
