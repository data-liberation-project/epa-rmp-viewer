We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe site has installed new cracking furnaces in the Olefins units.  Anhydrous ammonia, stored in pressurized tanks, will be utilized for air pollution abatement for each of these furnaces.  The new equipment and associated process hazard analysis prompt this change in the RMP submission.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed and modifications have been made accordingly.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naphtha, OP-400, and condensates into a number of products that include Propylene, Butadiene, Isoprene, Isobutane and other olefins. In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the East Plant / Mid Plant unit, including Isopropanol. There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Plant/Mid Plant manufacturing unit. "

Additionally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards and is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to all workers.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage is utilized, with the overall thought of identifying and mitigating health, safety and environmental issues before installation or operation. Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly through a review during any operator training opportunity.  They are also reviewed every five years.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completion of a process PHA. Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Qualification Program: A training and testing program is in place to ensure that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process. Operator re-qualification is required every three years at a minimum.\n\n\n\n"
