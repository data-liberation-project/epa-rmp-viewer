We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to manage the risk for all stakeholders.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent and mitigate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release. We also coordinate with the Houston Ship Channel Area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nThe site has installed new cracking furnaces in the Olefins units.  Anhydrous ammonia, stored in pressurized tanks, will be utilized for air pollution abatement for each of these furnaces.  The new equipment and associated process hazard analysis prompt this change in the RMP submission.  As part of the overall review of the re-submission, the regulated substances and inventories were reviewed and modifications have been made accordingly.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naphtha, OP-400, and condensates into a number of products that include Propylene, Butadiene, Isoprene, Isobutane and other olefins. In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the East Plant / Mid Plant unit, including Isopropanol. There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Plant/Mid Plant manufacturing unit. "

Additionally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards and is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to all workers.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage is utilized, with the overall thought of identifying and mitigating health, safety and environmental issues before installation or operation. Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly through a review during any operator training opportunity.  They are also reviewed every five years.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified as a result of management of change activities or after completion of a process PHA. Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Qualification Program: A training and testing program is in place to ensure that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process. Operator re-qualification is required every three years at a minimum.\n\n\n\n"

Plant and unit specific procedures for servicing operating equipment are in place, including preventive / predictive maintenance and reliability programs.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Training:  Mechanics and other craftsmen who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks are trained and tested on process equipment and inspections on operating equipment to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Program: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operations, following recognized standards and governmental requirements.\n\n\n\nQuality Assurance: A system is in place to ensure that purchased equipment and materials meet established engineering standards and specifications.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: The site has a management system to ensure that modifications to a process or facilities are evaluated to ensure continued safe operations. Design (DSRs) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted for facility or process changes prior to implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): Reviews are conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities or processes are safe to operate.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  The site ensures that accidents, incidents, and near misses are properly investigated to determine the root cause as well as contributing causes. In addition to the investigation, action items resulting from the investigation are communicated site-wide and tracked to completion to prevent recurrence.  CVON has not experienced any accidental releases regulated under the RMP rule over the past 5-years.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Audits are conducted on a regular basis to verify the provisions set forth under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented. These audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years by c"

Employees participate in PHA's and they have access to the PHA's and other process safety information.   Each operating and maintenance area has a representative on the Plant Safety Committee (EAGLES - Eliminating Accidents Guarantees Lasting Employee Safety) which supports occupational safety activities.  Contractors have a representative on this team.\n\n \n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained, and uses the Houston Area Safety Council as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility. All contractor workers must attend the Houston Area Safety Council training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant. In addition to basic training CVON site specific training is required prior to entering the plant.  The company has a rigorous process for pre-screening all contract companies to ensure they meet all company requirements.  All resident and many non-resident contractors are part of the site's CHESS (Contractors Helping Everyone Stay Safe) Team.\n\n\n\n4.0 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNone.\n\n\n\n5.0 Emergency Response\n\n\n\nThe site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the site coordinates with the community response plan through the North Channel LEPC, as well as the Harris County Office of Emergency Management. The site is also a participating member of the Houston Ship Channel Area Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA)."
