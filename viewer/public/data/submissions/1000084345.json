Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping and materials.\n\n6. Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n7. Members in good standing with the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The Hawkins Water Treatment Group - Memphis Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes several materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).   The covered process consists of container transfer and storage of those containers.  This site does not manufacture, package or use chlorine on site.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage.  This starts with DOT approved containers that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a container to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures and equipping them with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:  There has not been an accident involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:  In the event of a chlorine or s"
