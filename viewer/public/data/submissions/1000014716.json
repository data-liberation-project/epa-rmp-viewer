ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\nHopkins Power Plant recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Hopkins Power Plant PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing, and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The Hopkins Power Plant PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based processing operations\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\nHopkins Power Plant believes that employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Ammonia System and the Aqua Ammonia System Operators, have been deeply involved in the development and implementation of the PSM/RMP Program and they assume the major responsibility for operating safely.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nHopkins Power Plant produces power from Natural Gas and #2 Fuel Oil operates two separate ammonia Processes in the reduction of NOx products being discharged into the atmosphere.  (1) An enclosed Ammonia Refrigeration System to Chill process gasses, and (1) A system for injecting Aqua Ammonia into stack gas to reduce the NOx concentrations.\n\n3.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nSection 68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint of 200 ppm (ERPG-2). \n\nPlease refer to onsite documentation for Off-Site Consequence/Hazard Assessment data.\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "SE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nHopkins Power Plant conducts triennial PSM/RMP audits of the entire program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Hopkins Power Plant considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\nHopkins Power Plant emphasizes and insists on employee participation from the Chilled Water System and the Aqua Ammonia System operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP Program.\n\nHopkins Power Plant provides comprehensive training in Safe Work Practices, Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia Properties, Standard Operating Procedures, Emergency Response, Aqua system and Chiller System Processes, and  PSM/RMP Principles.\n\n\n5.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT RELEASE HISTORY\nThe Aqua Injection System and the Chilled Water Systems are both new so there have been no releases of ammonia or aqua ammonia that have resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-sit or off-site.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nHopkins Power Plant emergency response policies have been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal Regulations.  These policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, the Hopkins Power Plant Emergency Response Team will react with the proper actions, as listed in the Emergency Response Plan, in association with the local fire department\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nHopkins Power Plant the PSM/RMP program as a set of living documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision.\n\nHopkins Power Plant expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP program:\n\n(1)  Employee Participation is the Key to a successful program.  Both the managers and system operators are deeply involved in identifying the P&IDs, developing and updatin"

Hopkins Power Plant expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon a possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
