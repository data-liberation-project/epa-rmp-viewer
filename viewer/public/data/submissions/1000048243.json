Employees at the water plant are trained on the job. Also we have to get number of hours for the renewal of our treatment license and some of the renewal hours may contain classroom saftey training on handling chlorine. Personal at plant also has a maintance schedule were we test detectors &  replace pigtales \"o\" rings etc. Emergency equipment on hand SCBA  - ton cylinder repair kit- detection system-ammonia aersol - auto shut off - wind sock. The plant has a license operator on duty 24hrs day. The site were the chlorine is stored is locked at all times and only trained personal is allowed in.\n\n\n\n   Mt. Vernon has a Emergencey  Response Plan. The plan includes a detailed  response if  chlorine was release. Different models was used to determine different  endpoints for evacuations the weather also plays apart in the model. Mt. Vernon Fire Department and Local DES Manager also has a copy of the Response Plan. \n\n\n\n Chlorine Health Risk: Poisonous; May be fatel if inhaled. Contact may cause burns to skin and eyes. Contact with liquid may cause Frostbite. Run-off from fire control or dilution water may cause pollution."
