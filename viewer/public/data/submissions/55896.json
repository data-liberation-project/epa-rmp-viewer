The refrigeration system is a closed loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted during inspections and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBecause this is a new ammonia refrigeration system, there have been no accidental ammonia releases at the Costco Wholesale facility within the last five years.  The system is scheduled to startup in September 2009.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Frederick Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9 1 1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, calls will be made to the following organizations:  the National Response Center and within 15 minutes, the Maryland Department of the Environment, and the EPA Region 3 Main Office.\n\nCostco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at th"

The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on July 28, 2009.  This document includes the results from the two elements: 1) the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and 2) a Site Inspection. These studies were performed to define potential hazards associated with operational deviations of the ammonia system.  As a result of the Process Hazard Analysis, a number of recommendations were made, such as procedural changes, ammonia awareness training and some equipment upgrades."

The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for two cold storage areas (Meat Cooler and Cross Dock).  The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia Engine Room.  The condensers are mounted on the Engine Room roof, the water dump tank is located underground outside the Engine Room, and the evaporators are placed in the cold storage areas. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration service firm to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\nThere are ten ammonia detectors strategically located in the Engine Room (1) and the Warehouse (9).  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut down, condenser fans and water pumps shut down, evaporator fans shut down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to an underground water dump tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as a"

This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Frederick Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate the employees and to allow the responders to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nCostco Wholesale will begin operation of the facility in September 2009.  The ammonia system at the Costco Wholesale consists primarily of vessels, compressors, a condenser, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility provides cold storage space and a cross docking area for refrigerated items.  Ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and Warehouse that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilation system in the Engine Room and close all feed lines out of the Engine Room.  The ammonia detection system also has the capability to shut off all electrical power to the Engine Room.  \n\nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 20,000 pounds.  \n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.
