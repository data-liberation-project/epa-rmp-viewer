The facility is also subject to the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The requirements of the PSM program are essentially equivalent to RMP and, therefore, the safety program developed for the facility incorporates the requirements of both programs.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Naniwa Energy, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Storey County LEPC has been provided with a copy of Naniwa's Risk Management Plan.\n\n1.2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Tri-Center Power Plant produces electrical energy from fossil fuels. The operations are located in McCarran, Nevada. We employ approximately 6 people at the site and operate 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. \n\nThe Plant consists of six single gas turbine generators that run on natural gas.  The turbines also have the ability to operate on liquid fuel during periods of natural gas curtailment.  The exhaust gases leaving the turbines are sent through a two-part catalyst s"

      "SummaryText": "ystem to reduce the emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide by over 90 percent.  Reduction of NOx is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor into the exhaust gas upstream of a selective catalytic reactor (SCR).  The SCR converts the NOx particles in the exhaust stream to a harmless mixture of nitrogen and water.  The ammonia vapor is generated by controlled release to the exhaust stream of anhydrous ammonia which is liquefied under pressure during storage.  The facility stores 12,000 gallons (~63,800 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process because it is covered under OSHA Process Safety Management rules.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 12,000 gallons (~63,818 lb.)  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one pressurized tank.\n\n1.3 The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used equations from Appendix D of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and the model EPA RMP*Comp Version 1.06.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nFor each covered process, worst-case and alternative scenarios were developed to assess the possible consequences of accidental releases of these substances.  Worst-case scenarios involved estimation of the impact of a rapid, complete release under artificially adverse weather conditions, however unlikely the conditions and parameters might be.  The developed alternative scenario estimates the impact based on more realistic release parameters under typical meteorological conditions.\n\nThe EPA developed and approved software package, RMP*Comp, was utilized to estimate the toxic, explosive and flammable endpoint distances for the release scenarios.

      "SummaryText": " package, LandView III, as well as other available information, were employed to identify public and environmental receptors within the extents identified by RMP*Comp.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for ammonia at the Naniwa Energy facility is defined as the sudden release of 63,818 pounds of ammonia from an on-site storage tank.  This assumption assumes the pressurized ammonia, stored at ambient temperatures, is releases at ground level over a 10-minute interval, after which the vessel is assumed to be empty.  From the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration / EPA 550-B-00-006, EPA 2000, the toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.  Using RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint is calculated as 2.8 miles.  There are some industrial facilities and reportedly 117 residents in the radius of 2.8 miles from the site according to the 1990 census data in LandView III.  LandView III uses an average density for each census block and is often not accurate for small radii.  Therefore a field check was performed and no residences were observed within 2.8 miles. There were no other public or environmental receptors. \n\nThe most realistic accidental release scenario involves an ammonia release from a leaking line after the tank.  Such a release would be mitigated by excess flow valves and limit the release to 25 pounds per minute.  The duration of the release before responders repair the system was estimeted at 30 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint is calculated as 0.1 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within this distance. \n\n1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.
