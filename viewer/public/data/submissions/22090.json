      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY.  The owners, management and employees of Agroservice are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the releases to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmer.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia, reported as 431,900 pounds, includes anhydrous ammonia on site twice a year for a period of one week at a time and for use with a T-Reactor.  Approximately 282,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum amount that would be on site the remainder of the year.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railroad tank car, on site twice a year for a period of approximately one week at a time.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 4.4 miles\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of The Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, prop"

Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations at this time.\n\n9.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\n     Mr. Charles Starostko\n     P. O.
