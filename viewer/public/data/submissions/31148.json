      "SummaryText": "The City of Kilgore places great emphasis on safety and utilizing safe practices in handling the various chemicals used in the water treatment processes.  The City is committed to the safety and well being of its employees as well as the community.  This commitment comes from each employee, from the plant operators to the City Manager and City Commission.\n\nThe Well Field Storage Facility provides the facilities and equipment designed to treat the water pumped from the water supply wells owned and maintained by the City.  The treated water from this facility flows  to the City's Laird Hill Storage Facilty prior to entering the City's distribution system.  This treatment is designed to meet the standards as set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to provide adequate treatment to the water.\n\nOne of the primary chemicals used in this treatment is chlorine, which is used in the disinfection of the treated water to kill any harmful bacteria in the water supply.  Chlorine is a greenish yellow gas with a sharp, irritating, bleach-like odor.  At low concentrations chlorine becomes colorless but it retains its characteristic odor.  It is commonly used to disinfect water and wastewater, bleach woodpulp, and to make other chemicals.  Before chlorine became widely used as a disinfectant early in this century, waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid killed hundreds of thousands every year.  In 1900, 25,000 people died from typhoid just in the United States.  Due to chlorine, these deaths in the U.S. were reduced to fewer than 20 in 1960.  Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects from inhalation.   In high enough concentrations, chlorine will cause severe irritation to the eyes, coughing and difficulty breathing.  Chlorine does not burn but will support combustion (lets other articles burn). The vapors are much heavier th"

(2 cylinders of 1 ton capacity each) at the Well Field Storage Facility.\n\nTo evaluate the potential hazards to the community, two scenarios were considered as required.  These scenarios were evaluated using the EPA's RMP Comp modeling program.  The first, or worst case scenario, assumes a complete failure of one of the 1 ton chlorine cylinders, releasing the entire contents into the surrounding area within 10 minutes.  If this were to happen, the estimated distance the chlorine gas would travel would cover a radius of approximately 1.3 miles from the source, and could affect an estimated 115 people.\n\nThis scenario is highly unlikely, due to the industry safeguards designed into the cylinders.  For example, chlorine cylinders are ruggedly designed and DOT approved.  A protective cap covers the cylinder valves at all times when the cylinder is not in use.  The cylinders are also equipped with pressure relief devices to prevent rupture of the cylinder if exposed to heat.  Special chlorine regulators are used which automatically shut off the flow of chlorine if the feed pipe breaks.  Additionally, chlorine cylinders and process piping are located and installed to minimize the potential damage from impact.  A chlorine gas sensor and alarm system also provide warning of a leak in the chlorinator area.\n\nAnother more reasonable scenario evaluated for emergency planning purposes involves having one of the ? inch valves used to withdraw chlorine from the cylinder break off.  Should this happen, the estimated distance the chlorine gas would travel would be to a radius of about 0.1 miles, possibly affecting 1 person, a City employee who lives at the site.  The same safeguards mentioned above, as well as the prevention program outlined below, also make the likelihood of this happening significantly low.\n\nThe City is in compliance with the rules for extremely hazardous substances as se"

Chlorine cylinders are unloaded and handled by special equipment designed specifically for cylinder handling.  Cylinders are stored and used away from flammable liquids and gases.  Trained personnel following established written procedures are used to connect or disconnect a chlorine cylinder. These people have safety equipment readily available, which would allow them to safely remain and  close the cylinder valve if a leak occurred while changing out the cylinder.  Gaskets, valves, and connections are visually inspected each time a chlorine cylinder is changed.  Chlorine cylinders are inspected on a routine basis and are approved by the DOT.  Only one cylinder is connected to the process at each location to minimize the impact of a leak.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, nor known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nThe City maintains an emergency response program with the City's fire department.  In addition, the City is a supporter of the First Call emergency notification system.  General emergency response practices include the following: \n\n- The City maintains a community emergency notification plan. \n- Response is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community.\n- The City has radio communication capability with County emergency response agencies.\n- A telephone emergency notification system has been put into operation to provide quick, concise emergency information to the City's near neighbors.\n- Emergency response personnel regularly take training to comply with all federal, state, and local requirements.\n\nResponse practices specific to chlorine include the following:\n\n- Water system operators are trained and provided with proper p"

Personnel will continue to be trained in safe practices, and be updated on any new technologies that may help maintain and improve chlorine handling facilities."
