      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies\r\n\r\nThe Allison Gas Plant (Facility), owned and operated by Midcoast Pipelines (Texas Gathering), L.P. (Midcoast), is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Midcoast follows a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with Midcoast's recurring safety improvements. Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that Midcoast sets.\r\n\r\nThe Facility, located in rural Wheeler County, Texas, is a natural gas plant that extracts natural gas liquids (NGLs) from natural gas. The Facility receives, stores, and introduces NGLs into the pipeline for sale to wholesale markets. After arriving at the Facility via pipeline, the inlet gas stream has condensate removed. The remaining gas stream moves to the molecular sieve gas-dehydration unit, which removes most of the water from the gas stream. Following dehydration, the gas stream enters the cryogenic process where propane from (1) 12,500-gallon propane storage tank is used to cool the gas stream. As the gas is cooled and expanded, the heavier hydrocarbon gases are liquefied, thereby separating the residue gas stream from the NGL stream. The NGLs are then routed through (1) 20,000-gallon NGL surge tank prior to sale via pipeline. There are no threshold quantities"

The Facility also has multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate, and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the Facility's compression operations. There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantities present at the Facility. The Facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation. \r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulations, the worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquid in the largest vessel at the Facility causing a vapor cloud explosion. For the flammable mixture, this would involve the 20,000-gallon flammable NGL surge tank (80,310 pounds). For propane, this would involve the 12,500-gallon propane tank (52,876 pounds). Such scenarios are highly unlikely; however, using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosions could cause an overpressure of one (1) pound per square inch (psi) would be approximately 0.3 mile (approximately 1,585 feet) for the flammable mixture and approximately 0.3 mile (approximately 1,585 feet) for propane. An overpressure of one (1) psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of the Facility's classification as a Program Level 1 RMP facility, no alternative release scenarios are required for the regulated substances on site.\r\n\r\nMidcoast has discussed these potential flammable gas releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Wheeler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of impacts to the public.   \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the Accident Prevention Program in place at the Facility. Because the processes at the Facility are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management"

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). Process safety information is useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. The Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information."

The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.

The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  The Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.

New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:  The Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
