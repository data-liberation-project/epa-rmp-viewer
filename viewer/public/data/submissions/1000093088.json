(Ergon) oil refinery in Newell, WV.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nErgon's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Newell oil refinery is located at 9995 Ohio River Blvd, Newell, WV 26050. The refinery processes, stores, and handles three RMP regulated flammable substances above their threshold quantity. These are propane, natural gas liquids (NGL) which is an RMP flammable mixture, and hydrogen. Because the facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for these flammables, it is subject to the Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe covered processes include the Propane Deresiner, MEK Dewaxer (propane), NGL Storage and Unloading, and the HPU (hydrogen). It should be noted that the NGL Storage area and the HPU process are only above the threshold quantity during certain times of the year due to seasonal changes in gasoline formulation and scheduled maintenance outages. \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of these flammable materials is as follows: propane = 440,000 lbs., NGL (flammable mixture) = 620,000 lbs., and hydrogen = 20,000 lbs. No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nErgon has taken all th"

The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated primarily by the existing PSM program for the PSM covered processes. The facility has implemented a Program 3 level Prevention Program, as required by the RMP rules. These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and consequences of accidental releases from the facility and include such measures as a process hazard analysis, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and management of change. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard analysis, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements. The facility prevention program is maintained in accordance with best practices. Additionally, Ergon's management structure for RMP implementation involves many key facility personnel including the PSM Coordinator, management staff, technical and engineering staff, and environmental and safety personnel\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe facility has had no RMP-reportable accident/releases within the five years proceeding this RMP submittal.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan which addresses the required elements for emergency planning and response. Ergon has coordinated with the local fire department for response to accidental releases of propane.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nErgon is committed to continuous improvement and looks for opportunities to improve safety systems and programs at the facility.\n\n"
