This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of 3Bear Energy Services LLC. to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n3Bear Energy Libby Gas Plant is located in Lea County New Mexico and is owned by 3Bear Energy Services, LLC. operated by 3Bear Field Services, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe 3Bear Libby Gas Plant is a cryogenic NGL processing facility. The plant inlet is fed by remote compressor stations to move gas from the wellhead into the high pressure lateral to the facility.  The plant is designed to process natural gas and extract the NGL liquid from the product stream.  The inlet gas is separated from the pipeline liquids via the inlet slug catcher.  The pipeline liquids are then heated, the water is separated, and the condensate is routed to the stabilizer tower.  The stabilized liquid is routed to and stored in atmospheric tanks.  Gas from the stabilizer is recompressed in the overhead compressor and combined with the slug catcher gas and routed through a coalescing filter.  The CO2 and H2S is then removed from the gas stream via contact with amine.  The amine is reclaimed in the regeneration system where the acid gas (CO2, H2S) is removed and sent to a thermal oxidizer.  The treated gas stream is then routed through the molecular sieve bed(s) to remove H20.  Once the gas stream has been stripped and dried it is then ran through the cryogenic process, including the JT valve, turbo expander and demethanizer towe"

The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe 3Bear Energy Libby Gas Plant began operations on September 2018 and has no history of releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in onsite or offsite effects.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe 3Bear Energy Libby Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extraction facility, it is 3Bear Energy Services policy to follow our Emergency Response Plan.
