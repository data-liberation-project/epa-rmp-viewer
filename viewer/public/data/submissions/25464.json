As part of that commitment, Mead  has established management systems to maximize the safety of operating processes at this facility.  One component of this design is a risk management plan (RMP) that guides the safe handling, storage, and usage of regulated hazardous substances at Mead and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  \n\nOne of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mead.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Mead.\n\nThe risk management program at Mead consists of three elements:\n\n1) Hazard assessments to analyze and understand (a) the potential for offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accident and incident investigations that have occurred involving substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see Topics 1.3 and 1.5.\n\n2) Prevention programs to help maintain and safely operate those processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance - see Topic 1.4.\n\n3) Emergency planning for public notification and response should an accidental release of a regulated substance from covered processes ever occur - see Topic 1.6.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nMead's risk management planning is designed to assure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  However, it is only one component of the facility's safety program.  In fact, Mead has a comprehensive safety program in place, which directs man"

However, this RMPlan is limited to address those elements of the safety program at Mead that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\nMead limits the use of hazardous substances.  \nBefore using a hazardous substance at Mead, less hazardous alternatives are considered.   When a hazardous substance must be used, Mead thoroughly reviews the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, and the environment and manages its processes to prevent such effects.\n\nMead prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. \nMead is committed to the safety of employees, the public, the preservation of the environment, and  the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  In conjunction with best engineering practices, government and industry standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMead follows industry standards (e.g., Department of Transportation [DOT]), National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], The Chlorine Institute, and manufacturers' guidelines) to maximize the safe handling, storage, and usage of all hazardous materials.  For the Chlorine Dioxide process, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted in accordance with the requirements specified by OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nMead implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

Mead and local emergency response agencies (through the Chillicothe City Fire Department) have established a process to alert the community in the event an offsite consequence exists.\n\nMead Paper Division - Ohio Operations and Regulated Substances\nMead is an integrated paper products company primarily involved in the manufacture of pulp and paper from both hard and softwoods.  Mead handles one regulated toxic (no flammable) substance in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\nAs part of the manufacturing process at this facility, Chlorine Dioxide is used as a stock bleaching agent in the Pulp Mill and is inventoried at quantities above the EPA threshold limit and is regulated by the RMP rule.

When considering the release of a toxic substance, it is expected that people at the endpoint distance would experience little or no exposure, with no long-term health consequences.  However, the potential for some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye irritation, or throat irritation), while not likely, does exist.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Mead.  These requirements are:\n\n- one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 process (Chlorine Dioxide)\n- one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (Chlorine Dioxide)\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Mead.\n\nProgram 3 Process - Toxic Substance\nThe worst-case release scenario for the toxic chemical on site would be a rupture at the bottom of the 224,000 gallon Chlorine Dioxide storage tank full of solution (1 wt%), resulting in a Chlorine Dioxide/Chlorine vapor cloud release.  This scenario assumes that all safety devices fail.  Also, no administrative controls or passive mitigation were considered for this release scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint (0.0028 mg/l @ 25 degrees C ) calculated using DEGADIS vapor release modeling is 13 miles.

This model conservatively allows twenty minutes once vapors are detected by local gas monitors and activate alarms, for operations personnel to locate and assess the problem, suit up, and close the valve.  However, in all likelihood, a situation of this type would result in a more timely remote shutdown of the process (and the leak flow).  Again, the released chlorine dioxide solution would form an evaporative pool with Chlorine Dioxide and Chlorine released as a vapor cloud.  The ALOHA modeled distance to the 0.0028 mg/l toxic endpoint is one mile.  The U.S. Census indicates that 1700 people live within this distance.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance (e.g., part of a residential subdivision).  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nMead maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place at Mead include:\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program.\nSince 1963, Mead has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Mead formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Generation and Storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, in accordance with the EPA RMP rule, one Program 3 proccess was identified.

For each regulated process, these documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Mead; (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Mead; and (3) the technical and design bases, and configuration of the equipment.  Mead ensures that this process safety information is available to all Mead employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), and the Chillicothe Fire Department.\n \nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects, or in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analysis of the process.  Operating parameters are included in the standard operating procedures to enhance the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used in (1) employee training; (2) performing process hazard analyses; and (3) the monitoring and maintainence of equipment. \n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Mead, including regulated substances in covered processes.

Recommendations and action items resulting from the analysis are documented and tracked to completion.  Responsibility to resolve action items are assigned to unit personnel, and where appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nMead process safety personnel, engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to regulated process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\nTRAINING\nMead provides basic chemical specific HAZCOM training for all employees.  Mead trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  For current hazardous process operations personnel, Mead training programs include both initial and refresher training that cover (1) general overview of the process; (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process; and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Both oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the appropriate level of training prior to working in, on, or around a regulated process.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nMead maintains the mechanical integrity of regulated process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, o"

For regulated processes, all not-in-kind, non-emergency changes must have prior review and qualified approval before the change can be implemented.  This is to prevent inadvertent consequences of a process change, and to ensure any potential hazards created by the change are proactively recognized and addressed; affected process safety information and procedures are updated; and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\nMead performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that: \n- Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; \n- Adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place; and\n- Employee training has been completed.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT\nMead audits regulated processes to be certain that the Mead prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of its operations.  Mead maintains a cross-corporate audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in PSM, the RMP rule, and in the regulated processes.

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that Mead hires only those contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  Mead instructs contract supervisors as to the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, all Mead safe work practices, and Mead emergency response procedures.  Mead requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at Mead, before that worker begins work at the facility.  Mead periodically reviews contractor's training documents and audits work performance to help ensure safe practices are followed. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Mead has implemented safety features specific to regulated hazardous substance used at the facility.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine Dioxide - To avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of a hazardous material, Mead produces Chlorine Dioxide at the facility and stores it as a dilute aqueous solution.  Chlorine Dioxide is generated on-site using the R8 process in the Chlorine Dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a 1wt% Chlorine Dioxide solution is generated.  A diked area around the storage tank further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere has been only one accidental release in the past five years that resulted in two recordable toxic vapor exposure injuries.  This incident occurred on May 19, 1997, when Pulp Mill maintenance personnel responded to a bleach plant flange leaking dilute Chlorine Dioxide solution without proper respiratory protection.  No serious injuries resulted.  The recordable status of the injuries was invoked when, as a precautionary measure"

      "SummaryText": ", the two maintenance employees were taken to the plant hospital and received follow-up observation for minor respiratory irritation.  The release caused no other significant onsite or offsite effects.  An incident investigation team was assembled, and the team followed the incident investigation protocol.  The team suggested several improvements (including re-training of the affected employees) to the Chlorine Dioxide Respiratory Protection Program that were evaluated, and where appropriate, implemented. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\nMead's personnel and procedures are prepared to coordinate the activities of the facility and maintain an emergency response team trained in emergency response procedures.  Mead periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local fire department, the first-response emergency team, the Corporate Crisis Management Team, and local emergency response agencies.  Mead employees will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks).  In the event of a larger fire or release, employees will be evacuated from the area, the Mead Emergency Response Team will be responsible for initial response and assessment, and contact with the Chillicothe City Fire Department as necessary.  All Mead personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.\n \nMead has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n- Informing the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences;\n- Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substances at Mead; \n- Controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment;\n- Inspecting and maintaining emergency re"

Mead provides appropriate information to and regularly communicates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Chillicothe and Ross County fire chiefs.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nMead constantly strives to improve the safety of these regulated processes.  Through the PSM PHA and Audit programs, incident investigation action items, and ongoing employee participation in all safety programs, the planning and implementation of changes to reduce risk and improve safety is a continuous process.\n\nMead has reviewed (PHA conducted 10/98) the Chlorine handling system, upgraded all handling and operating procedures, increased the inspection frequency for chlorine equipment, and took steps to decrease the traffic near chlorine equipment.\n\nThese changes reduce the likelihood of a Chlorine release caused by degraded equipment or external impact."
