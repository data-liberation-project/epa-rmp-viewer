This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of our regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility\u00bfs Hazmat Teams, Local Fire Department and the Barbour County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n\nStationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nEquity Group, Eufaula Division, 57 Melvin Clark Road, Baker Hill, Alabama  is located in a rural area approximately three miles outside of the small town of Baker Hill. Equity Group is responsible for the initial and further processing of poultry products in various varieties.  The facility consists of two separate processing facilities at one location. The facilities use an Anhydrous Ammonia closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media for each processing center.  Both plants operate around the clock (7) seven days a week.  \n\nAs a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical used at the Equity Group, Eufaula facility, and in accordance with EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 the facility has developed and implemented the RMP Program 3 requirements.  Additionally the facility also has in place a Process Safety Management program for each ammonia process as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119.  Each process center further uses this program as a management system per the outlined requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nHaving two separate ammonia refrigeration system processes, the facility modeled a worst case and alternate case scenario for each proc"

Based on the reporting criteria of the RMP requirements the facility details the worst case scenario from one of the processes with the longest endpoint in addition to an alternate scenario for each process.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as required in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text for each of the two process systems.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP COMP modeling software was utilized exclusively. The RMP COMP models are referenced in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process. \n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with the Equity Group Eufaula Division Environmental Managers office.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2000 data.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\nPrevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The Equity Group Eufaula Division facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.\n\nEquity Group, Eufaula has integrated various engineering and administrative control mechanisms to eliminate and/or minimize any possible upsets or releases from this facility. These mechanisms include, but are not limited to electronic ammonia detection and alarms located through out the facility, safety devices and interlocks that"

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration process are planned at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
