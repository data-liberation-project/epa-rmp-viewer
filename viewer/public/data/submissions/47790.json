      "SummaryText": "Dart Container Corporation of Horse Cave Kentucky uses iso-pentane as the blowing agent in its DI foam extrusion process.  Iso-pentane is a flamable liquid.  The iso-pentane is stored in a pressurized above ground storage tank.  There are are sniffers in all areas where liquid iso-pentane is handled to detect leaks.  Interlocks are used to shut down the process if concnetrations get to unsafe levels (50 % LEL inside and 25 % LEL outside).  As required Dart also has standard operating prodeducres and training in place to instruct operators on how to safely handle iso-pentane.  There is a written SPCC plan that addresses iso-pentane spills and a written emergency response plan that addresses activities and actions that need to be taken in response to a release, fire, and/or explosion.  Evacuation drills are completed on a yearly basis for all personell on site.  Dart has had no major spills of iso-pentane.  Dart also has polystrene extrusion and foam molding operations located on this site which do not use a flammable liquid.  \n\nThe maxmum amount of iso-pentane on site is 312,473 pounds (60,000 gallons which is the tank size).  The worst case release senario involves a rupture of the tank with a release of a vapor cloud that then ignites.  The area of impact would include all areas within .54 miles of the tank according to EPA's Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidelines.  There are a few residential houses across the street from the plant that would fall within this impact range.  The alternate release cscenaria inloves a transfer hose failure which would release the tank truck contents during a fill on to the ground.  Even though this activities is monitored for its entirerity we assumed that it would go undectected at a rate of 100 GPM for thirty minutes.  Again we assumed this iso-pentane would vaporize and then ignite causing an area of impact .2 miles."
