Lilly manufactures both human health products and animal health products at its Tippecanoe Laboratories facility (Tippecanoe Labs).  Tippecanoe Labs is located near Lafayette, Indiana. Operations at Tippecanoe Labs began in 1954.  Tippecanoe Labs owns over 2000 acres, including farmland and a wildlife habitat.  The plant itself includes 128 buildings on 500 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Tippecanoe Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n4.  Five-year accident history\n5.  The emergency response program\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  Tippecanoe Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Tippecanoe labs' accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nTippecanoe laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also host plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.  \n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Incineration Services, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  Fermented Products Manufacturing, manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives. This area includes manufacturing facilities, Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  The third functional area, Site Services, includes Utilities and maintenance areas that provide services to the entire site.  The site also has laboratories and pilot plant facilities supporting the research and development of human and animal health products.  The facility has a Title V operating permit under the Clean Air Act.\n\nThe followin"
