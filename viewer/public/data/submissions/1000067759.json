      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nE. R. Carpenter, L.P. is totally committed to the safe operation of its Roger W. Powell chemical production facility.  Engineering safeguards and safety factors have been incorporated throughout the processes employed and have been reviewed in detail as part of the Process Safety Management program.  Additionally, senior management has and will continue to ensure that resources are available for the materials, equipment, and training required for safe operation of the facility.  Facility safety is a team goal which is successfully achieved through the combined efforts of each individual onsite and the commitment of senior management.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe E. R. Carpenter, L.P., Roger W. Powell Plant, located at 11002 Choate Rd., Pasadena, Texas, manufactures polyether polyols and prepares blends of polyether polyols with various other materials for internal company use and for external sale.  The first polyether polyol production unit at the facility, the P-1 Unit, was started up in 1973, and since that time six additional polyether polyol production units, the P-2, P-3, P-4, P-5, P-6, P7 Units and a blending facility have been added.  Approximately 130 Carpenter personnel work at the facility on a full-time basis.\n\n\n\nThe polyether polyol production units are designed to produce batch quantities of various low vapor pressure polyether polyols.  Production of a typical polyether polyol involves the reaction of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with a starter material such as glycerine.  Ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, formaldehyde and ethylenediamine are the regulated substances in these units.   \n\n\n\nEthylene oxide is supplied to the plant by railcar to four closed, nitrogen-padded and externally-refrigerated pressure vessels and is fed via pumps to the reactors at the facility.  Propylene oxide is supplied via pipeline and/or railcar and/or tank"

      "SummaryText": " truck to four closed, nitrogen-padded pressure vessels and is fed via pump or directly via pipeline to the reactors at the facility.  Formaldehyde is received as a water solution via tank trucks, and is stored in a nitrogen-padded tank with a conservation vent.  It is fed via pump from the storage tank to one of the reactors at the facility.  Ethylenediamine is received via tank truck and is transferred directly from the tank truck to two of the reactors at the facility.\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of the Risk Management Plan, the seven polyol production units have been grouped into four processes.  The P-1 and P-2 polyol production units have been grouped together into one process as they share the same ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage vessels.  The P-3/P-6 and P-4/P-7 polyol production units have also been grouped together into one process as they share the same ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage vessels.  The P-5 polyol production process has an ethylene oxide and propylene oxide storage vessels and is a separate process.\n\n\n\nThe chemical blending unit is designed to produce batch quantities of various blended polyol and isocyanate products, and to drum polyols and isocyanates.  Production of a typical chemical blending product involves the mixing of either a polyol or an isocyanate with small amounts of other raw materials to produce one part of a two-part polyurethane foam producing system.  Toluene diisocyanate is the regulated substance in this unit.\n\n\n\nThe toluene diisocyanate that is used at the blending facility is received in bulk via tank truck and is stored in a nitrogen-padded pressure vessel.  It is fed via pump to a nitrogen padded mix tank where it is mixed with a polyol and other raw materials to produce a finished product.  \n\n\n\nFor the purposes of the Risk Management Plan, the chemical blending unit is considered a separate process from the polyol production processes.  The toluene diisocyanate storage and mix system is independent of th"

      "SummaryText": "e polyol production processes.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nAll of our polyol production processes use ethylene oxide and propylene oxide as major raw materials.  In addition, the P-1 and P-3 polyol production units use ethylenediamine as a raw material, and the P-3 polyol production unit uses formaldehyde as a raw material.  Ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and formaldehyde are covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, as well as the Risk Management Program rule, and as such, their use is subject to significant safe management review.  Ethylenediamine is not covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, but it is subjected to the same reviews as the other three chemicals.  Prevention measures in place include extensive process controls (e.g., safety interlocks, pressure monitoring systems, etc.), mitigation systems (i.e. dry and wet sprinklers/deluge systems) and detection systems (i.e., process area hydrocarbon detection systems).  We have procedures such as our Preventive Maintenance Program, Lockout/Tagout Procedure, Incident Investigation Procedure and Process Change Authorization Procedure in place to minimize the possibility of an incident. We also have an extensive Chemical Operator Training program in place to ensure that operations personnel know how to operate the processes in a safe manner, and we have performed Process Hazard Analyses to evaluate our systems.\n\n\n\nOur chemical blending process which uses toluene diisocyanate as a primary raw material is not covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations and is not subject to the Risk Management Program prevention requirements.   However, the operation does have standard operating procedures designed to minimize the potential for releases and is covered by the Lockout/Tagout and Incident Investigation procedures at the facility. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents with off-site or si"
