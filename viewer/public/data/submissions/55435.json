Patterson Vegetable Company's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Patterson Vegetable Company's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Safety Manager.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Patterson Vegetable Company facility is located at 100 West Las Palmas Avenue in Patterson, California, which is adjacent to the CA-33 Highway.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in 1946 with several additions, renovations, and modifications occurring since that time.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.\r\n\r\nThe primary business of Patterson Vegetable Company is to package and store frozen vegetables.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains approximately 115,738 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, in three ammonia refrigeration systems.  Each refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage warehousing.  Typical operating conditions range from 8 Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side of the system.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPEC"

      "SummaryText": "IFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\r\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\r\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\r\n\r\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Patterson Vegetable Company to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Patterson Vegetable Company's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor th"

The ammonia detection systems have two setpoints.  At the first setpoint, local horns and strobes are activated to alert operators and employees to the situation.  At the second setpoint, the detection system will stop liquid supply (Process and Cold Storage Areas) or liquid feed (Engine Rooms).\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the Patterson Vegetable Company facility's accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (June 8 - 9, 2009), revealed that there have been no significant releases in the past five years (June 2004 to June 2009) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. However, there have been a few minor incidents on site within the past five years.  The releases are detailed below.\r\nDecember 31, 2006: There was a seal failure at Belt Freezer #7. Approximately 26 lbs. of ammonia was lost.\r\nJanuary 26, 2007: During replacement of old liquid lines inside the main engine room, an ammonia valve was bumped and cracked open causing liquid ammonia to be released into atmosphere.\r\nAugust 22, 2007: There was a cracked seal on the south warehouse #6 ammonia pump.\r\nNovember 16, 2007: Production totes cracked an oil drain line in the main building warehouse #2.\r\nMay 30, 2008: The main building model 33\u00bfs freezer plate moved out of position and cracked a spud. The facility was evacuated as precaution.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemente"

This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.  The Plan is distributed to new hires who are required to read and sign a certification page.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA Revalidation of the initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on June 8-9, 2009, which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Patterson Vegetable Company facility located at 100 West Las Palmas Ave. in the Patterson, California.  Patterson Vegetable Company is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n\r\n4.
