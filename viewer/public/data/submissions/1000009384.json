      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary Risk Management Program Plan\nCity of Portland Bureau of Water Works Headworks Facility\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) submittal is for the City of Portland Bureau of Water Works (Bureau) Headworks Facility (Headworks) located at 50105 Rock Cut Road in the Bull Run Watershed, Clackamas County, Oregon. Headworks uses gaseous chlorine liquefied under pressure to disinfect the drinking water supply. Headworks qualifies for a Level 1 RMP since there are no offsite receptors within the area of a worst case release, the facility has not had an accidental release resulting in offsite consequences, and facility emergency response has been coordinated with local responders. More information on these safety aspects is given below.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Bureau of Water Works to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest means practicable. The Bureau has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training for workers, state of the art release containment and treatment systems, and an Emergency Action Plan for notification of emergency responders and the community in the unlikely event of a chlorine release. Additionally, Headworks is located in a remote area away from public receptors. In light of these safety considerations, the benefits of drinking water disinfection (a safe secure supply of clean drinking water) greatly outweigh the minor risk of using chlorine at Headworks.\n\n\nHeadworks Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Headworks chlorination system is located 5 miles behind a locked gate, within the Bull Run Watershed, which is closed to all public access. The chlorination system consists of two separate rooms: the Primary Storage Room and the Standby Storage Room. A total of up to 36 one-ton containers of chlorine are stored within these rooms. Both rooms are served by an emergency air scrubber system, which"

      "SummaryText": "when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The emergency scrubber system has a back-up generator allowing it to operate even if electrical power to Headworks is interrupted.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Headworks has voluntarily implemented the substantial requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management rule, which includes systematic evaluation of critical systems to prevent accidental releases. Additionally, the Bureau had an independent review of process systems, management, training, and emergency response procedures to ensure maximum safety. The Bureau conducts safety reviews any time a process change is proposed. \n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo release of chlorine or other chemicals that resulted in injury, evacuation, or sheltering in place (that is requiring residents to stay indoors) to offsite receptors has ever occurred at Headworks.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Bureau has a written emergency response plan that includes elements covering release response, emergency coordination, responder and community notification, hazard recognition, emergency equipment, evacuation procedures, staff training, and emergency exercises. The Bureau has a full time Emergency Manager who works closely with the State of Oregon's Fire Marshal's Regional Hazmat Team # 3. Team #3 along with Sandy Fire District #72 as First Responders has agreed to provide emergency services to Headworks since it is most qualified to respond to chemical emergencies.\n\nHeadworks has remote release sensors that are monitored at the offsite Water Control Center. The Water Control Center can activate emergency response to Headworks. Emergency equipment that allows workers to respond to small incidents is maintained onsite. All employees are trained in emergency response procedures upon hire and annually thereafter.  The facility is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "he Bureau plans to continuously evaluate and improve safety procedures at Headworks as opportunities arise. Training exercises will continue on a regular basis. No major safety modifications to Headworks are currently planned. The offsite consequence analysis was originally generated in 1999 using the DEGADIS 2.1 model.  This is currently available through the EPA Technology Transfer Network Support Center for Regulatory Atmospheric Modeling so the Portland Water Bureau's offsite consequence analysis has not changed.  The Bureau will reexamine its offsite consequence analysis if the EPA recommends a more applicable model in the future."
