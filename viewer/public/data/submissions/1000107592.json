The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including reporting of an emergency, emergency response, first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response, and post-incident clean-up and decontamination requirements. In addition, PAMC has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to PAMC processes or facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program at PAMC is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of Jefferson County. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local governmental officials, and industry representatives. PAMC has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials, who have direct communications with local police and fire departments. Jefferson County has an Emergency Alert System (EAS) in place which provides residents with instructions as to what to do in the event of an emergency. The EAS provides a means of notifying the public of an incident if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, PAMC conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and local emergency response organizations.\n\n8.0 PLANNED CHAN"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. The audit team develops findings and aligns with PAMC's management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented in a computer database, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n5.0 CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at PAMC have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

PAMC incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n4.9\tHot Work Permit\nPAMC utilizes a comprehensive work permit system to safely manage all work performed at the facility. In addition to hot work, the work permit system also includes requirements for entry into confined spaces, as well as requirements for other than hot work. The existing work permit system serves as a framework for all other safe work practices.\n\n4.10\tManagement of Change\nPAMC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operation conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the changes.\n\n4.11\tIncident Investigation\nPAMC promptly investigates incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n4.8\tMechanical Integrity\nPAMC has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Applicable written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.

Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort. All operating training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n4.6\tContractors\nPAMC uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities. PAMC also uses contractors for less safety-sensitive work, such as security, janitorial, ground maintenance, engineering, clerical, etc.\n\nContractors performing the more safety-sensitive work dealing with direct maintenance and construction activities are subjected to more stringent safety requirements to ensure that they: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of the workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.
