Chlorine is listed as an extremely hazardous substance by both EPA and OSHA. All PAW facilities at or above the EPA threshold amount of 2500 pounds of chlorine is subject to the EPPA CAAA regulations and will comply.\r\n\r\nBy this narrative we incorporate by reference all aspects of the PAW Process Safety Management Program (PSM) including but not limited to Hazard Assessments, Prevention Programs, Emergency Response Programs and the American Water system Risk Management Manual.\r\n\r\nEach Treatment Plant covered by the EPA RMP Guidelines is also covered by the OSHA PSM program. A PSM manual and an American Water system Risk Management Manual is available at each plant location for review.\r\n\r\nAll Emergency Response procedures are included at the treatment plant.  Procedures involving evacuation of the plant are included. Procedures involving the emergency response to a chemical release are located at the plant and all plant personnel are trained in the appropriate action to be taken.  Procedures involving communication and evacuation of the public are deferred to the Local Emerency Planning Committee (LEPC) of the local agency responsivble for emergency coordination.\r\n\r\nThe Clarion Wastewater Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management plan has been reviewed and revised on March 26, 2018 by Sharon R. Tanner."
