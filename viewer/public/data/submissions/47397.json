The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\nRelease Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 500 pounds of ammonia.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the community of Mt. Airy and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the excess flow valves installed in the ammonia transfer piping system. \n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 8,310 pounds of acrylonitrile.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the acrylonitrile could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are: one school (Garyville Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School); portions of the community of Mt. Airy;  and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the automated shutoff valves installed in the acrylonitrile transfer piping system; passive mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the drains and sump under the unloading area. \n\nEpichlorohydrin\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 7,300 pounds of epichlorohydrin.  Using typical weather conditions specified"

Within the potentially affected area is one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the automated shutoff valves installed in the epichlorohydrin transfer piping system; passive mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the drains and sump under the unloading area.\n\nFormaldehyde\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing10,000 pounds of formaldehyde solution.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the formaldehyde could travel 0.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are: one school (Garyville Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School); portions of the community of Mt. Airy; and one industrial facility.  Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include personnel monitoring during transfer operations; passive mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the drains and sump under the unloading area.\n\n\n\nRelease Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nDimethylamine\n\nThe release scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 7,400 pounds of dimethylamine.  The OCA Guidance estimates that, if the release were to result in a vapor cloud explosion, it would affect an area within 0.06 miles of the tank.  This area would be contained within the confines of the Nalco facility.   Active mitigation measures considered under this scenario include the automatic shut off valves installed within the dimethylamine piping system. \n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergenc"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n? Process safety information\n? Process hazard analysis\n? Operating procedures\n? Training\n? Mechanical integrity\n? Management of change\n? Pre-startup review\n? Compliance audits\n? Incident investigation\n? Employee participation\n? Hot work permit\n? Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nInstallation of deluge systems around storage tanks containing acrylonitrile, ammonia, epichlorohydrin, and dimethylamine;\n\nInstallation of deluge systems around unloading areas handling acrylonitrile, epichlorohydrin and dimethylamine;\n\nInstallation of chemical specific sensors controlling automatic shutoff valves in the acrylonitrile, dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin unloading areas;\n\nInstallation of chemical specific sensors to detect leaks in the acrylonitrile, ammonia, dimethylamine, epichlorohydrin, and formaldehyde storage and processing areas;\n\nA preventive maintenance program to inspect all chemical hoses used in the plant.  These inspections include the transfer hoses used for unloading acrylonitrile, ammonia, dimethylamine, epichlorohydrin, and formaldehyde.\n\nWritten procedures to address unloading, leak detection and spill reporting in the acrylonitrile, ammonia, dimethylamine, epichlorohydrin, and formaldehyde unloading and storage areas.\n\nSpecific emergency instructions have been included in the D/3 computer \"notebook\" used to control production processes.\n\n\nDrain covers have been purchased to improve spill control within the plant drainage system.\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.

The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years (2000 - present):\n\nThere have been no accidental chemical releases involving these materials above their Regulated Quantity (RQ) at our facility in the last five years.  There have been several small releases of acrylonitrile, ammonia and formaldehyde.  None of these resulted in injuries to employees, nor did any affect the community or environment.  After each of these incidents, we conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  None of these incidents met the requirements to be reported under EPA's RMP.\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Plan\n\nWe maintain a contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are considering at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nTrain and equip the existing plant HAZMAT team to perform air monitoring in the surrounding community during a release;\n\nConvert existing Emergency Plans to an Integrated Contingency Plan;\n\nUpgrade/develop facility maps for fire systems; evacuation, drainage and equipment locations.\n\n\n8.0 Certifications\n\nFor all cover"
