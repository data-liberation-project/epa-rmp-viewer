      "SummaryText": "Facility Description:\n  The Municipal Authority of the City of Sunbury owns and operates the Sunbury Water Filtration Plant. The plant treats an average of 2.6 million gallons per day of water to serve the population of Sunbury and parts of the surrounding Township of Upper Augusta. The plant falls under the EPA's Risk Management Plan Program 3 rules due to the use of chlorine in its disinfection process. A maximum inventory of 8,000 lbs of chlorine is kept on site and up to 4,000 lbs (two 1 ton cylinders) of chlorine are connected to the facility's water system at any one time. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \nThe water plant's chlorine facility was modified in 1996 to allow vacuum regulators to be mounted directly on the chlorine tanks. Any breaks in the line after the regulator will cause the release of chlorine to stop. A chlorine leak detection system is in place, which sets off warning lights at the facility, in the event that there is a leak. The water plant's low employee turn over ensures that there are experienced employees familiar with the operation of the system; this reduces the risk of accidental release. Ongoing maintenance and inspection of vacuum regulators, SCBA , fire extinguishers, and the B-kit further reduces the risk of release and increase the efficiency of emergency response. In addition to the Municipal Authority's Emergency Response Plan, the water plant has a Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan which outlines the facility's Emergency Response Policies specifically in relation to the accidental release of toxic, hazardous, or otherwise threatening materials. As a part of the PPC Plan, all employees of the plant are trained to follow the plant's Code Yellow Chlorine Emergency Procedures. The water plant is also part of the Northumberland County Emergency Response Plan.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\n  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations was "

      "SummaryText": "used to determine the worse-case chlorine release scenario. An impact area with a 1.3 mile radius was determined for a release of 2000 lbs of chlorine over ten minutes time. The only mitigation considered in this scenario was that the chlorine facility is enclosed in a building. An additional consideration that would affect the spread of the chlorine gas in a real life situation is the area's topography. A levee/dyke system to the south and west of the City would reduce the spread of the heavier than air toxin in these directions. Additionally, hilly regions to the south and to the northeast would hinder the spread of the gas. No topographic obstacles to the east are apparent.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\n For the alternate release scenario, vessel leak was chosen. Active mitigation in the form of emergency response procedures was considered as part of the scenario. An impact area with a 0.1 mile radius was determined for a release of 540 lbs of chlorine over an hour. This is a more realistic impact area as it is mostly within the confines of the City's levee system in the southern and western directions.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nOn November 25, 2009, in the course of changing chlorine cylinders, after reconnection, the cylinder valve was opened by an employee to check for leaks in the connections and piping. A small amount of chlorine leaked from the area of the lead washer and was inhaled during the time it took to shut the valve.  The employee was taken to the emergency room where he received minor care and was released. \n\n  \nPlanned Changes:\n No equipment or procedural changes are planned at this time, as a result of the risk management plan evaluation. However, a more pro-active approach to record management in regards to training and maintenance is needed. This change should be affected through implementation of the risk management program.\n\n\n"
