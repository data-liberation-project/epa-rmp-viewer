      "SummaryText": "Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, located in Brunswick County, produces electric power for retail distribution.  The plant operates two nuclear reactors for power generation.  The heat from the nuclear reactors is used to generate steam which drives the turbines.  Water which is used for cooling is treated with chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in a fenced-in section adjacent to the chlorination plant.  Other components of the water treatment system are:  evaporators (5), chlorinators (5), and injectors (5).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario analysis required by 40 CFR 68.165 was conducted based on Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) guidance issued by EPA.  The alternative release scenario analysis, also required by 40 CFR 68.165, was conducted based on guidance provided by The Chlorine Institute in Pamphlet 74 (Edition 3, April 1998).    All results of these analyses are summarized in the RMP.\n\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant is subject to regulations enforced by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  NRC regulations require procedures and safe operating practices to minimize health and safety risks (to the employees as well as the public) resulting from exposure to radioactive material as well as other toxic/flammable materials.  With respect to safety inspection performed by an external agency (Item 1.15 of the RMP), as a licensee, BSEP maintains NRC safety requirements.Consequently, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant has developed procedures and safe operating practices for the handling of chlorine at the Plant.  These procedures and safe operating practices have resulted in no accidental release during the past five-year period which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  A process hazards analysis (PHA) conducted in July 1998 indicated that no changes were necessary.\n\nThe RMP*Submit program has flagged the latitude and longitude"
