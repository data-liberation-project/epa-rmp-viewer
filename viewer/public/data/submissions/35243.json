      "SummaryText": "G.B.R.A. recognizes the need for care and hazards in haandling of Chlorine. Chlorine handling had been addressed in the GBRA Safety Manual, the Job Safety Analysis, the Emergency Operations Plan, the Preventive Maintenance Program and the Annual Safety Audit.  Training is conducted on practice one-ton cylinder purchased for this specific purpose.  Leak detection monitors are located at the Luling Water Treatment Plant that activates an audible and visible alarm that includes emergency dial up when plant is not occupided.  Personnel required to repair leaks have access to level \"A\" chemical suits,  self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and required chlorine leak repair kit. As an added security and safety measure the chlorine storage area has been secured with a man proof enclosure and entry alarm monitor.  Even with all the care currently provided, the review of the Risk Management Plant demonstrated the need for some improvements and these items that require attention will be corrected.  The worst case scenario for chlorine is 1.9 miles.  The impact of this is to a mostly urban area.  The Luling Water Treatment Plant is manned 16 hours per day with chlorine alarms implemented into SCADA system, with automatic dial-out capablilites in case of chlorine leak. The plant is scheduled to go to 24 hour manned operation in the near future.  The Alternate release scenario is 1.5 miles.  The scenario does not assume that repairs would be make to the leaking container, nor do they include active mitigation efforts."
