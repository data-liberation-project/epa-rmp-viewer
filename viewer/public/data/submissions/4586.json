The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Blount, Inc. does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility and (2) the result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if this release occurred.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by the CCI operation.  These requirements are:\n7 one worst-case release scenario for chlorine, and\n7 one alternative release scenario for chlorine.\n The following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by Blount, Inc.:\n1.3.1  Chlorine Releases\nWorst Case\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic substances is the simultaneous failure of the fusible pressure release plugs from the six 2,000 lb. chlorine cylinders releasing the entire 12,000 pounds in 10 minutes (1/1,200#/min.) from an accident such as a fire.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 8.7 mg/m3 is 2.44 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 31,245 people live within this distance from the facility.  There are numerous public receptors located within the Worst Case and Alternative Scenario endpoint circles for chlorine.  These receptors include:  schools, public building, hospitals, parks and recreational areas.

The U.S. Census indicates that 1,288 people live within this distance.  Several Lewiston neighborhoods, public receptors and one environmental receptor are located within this distance as shown below: \n \n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has formalized the prevention program for connecting the chlorine cylinders and maintaining related equipment.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Operations Program 3 prevention program and addresses the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n1.  Process Safety Information.  Blount, Inc. maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation.    These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment.  The Operation ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management, and the Lewiston Fire Department.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the site, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes.  MSDSs for hazardous substances in work areas are handled for each process and are available to operators for ready reference.  In addition, a list of chemicals on-site and quantities are provided to the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management and the Lewiston Fire Department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\nThe engineerin"
