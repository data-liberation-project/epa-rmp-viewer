Most of our products are formulated by blending several raw materials within a mixing vessel and then packaging into various size containers.  Depending on our customer's needs, our package types can range from small 5-gallon pails to 6000-gallon truckload quantities.  Similarly, our raw materials, which we receive from suppliers, come in various size containers depending on customer demand for the product and the amount necessary to meet supply limitations and production demand.\n\nThe GE Betz - Bakersfield Plant covers 13 acres of property, of which 2 acres are used for offices, warehouse(s), production facilities and outdoor material storage.  The balance is used for access roads, parking lot or open lawn, or idle areas.  At the facility, cyclohexylamine is a chemical raw material stored onsite as a liquid in 55 gallon drums.  Cyclohexylamine neutralizes acids as a corrosion inhibitor, which makes it particularly useful for our boiler product lines. This raw material is stored in a protecte"

Using the U.S. EPA Offsite Consequence Guidance modeling data, these scenarios would have an offsite consequence.  Although this material is normally stored in a protected containment area when not in transit, for the purposes of meeting the EPA requirements we did not consider any \"passive\" controls.  We also conservatively viewed that an amount of several drums would be released without any intervention by plant personnel to stop the release or to control the spread of the release, even though our facility personnel are capable of responding to mitigate a release of this chemical in various ways.  Because all plant operators are well trained in hazardous chemical handling procedures, forklift operation, and spill response, we think that a release event of this sort is unlikely to occur.\n\nAs an \"Alternative Scenario\" an event more likely to occur than the \"Worst Case\" involving cyclohexylamine we considered a release event of a single drum, again using the EPA methodology.  Mitigation systems were not included in this scenario.  The analysis indicates that these scenarios would have an offsite consequence but it would be limited to a distance slightly less than that of the \"Worst Case\" scenario.  We choose to evaluate these scenarios because the EPA required an \"Alternate Scenario\" that extended beyond the fenceline, although we feel an event involving a minor drum puncture of substantially less than a drum quantity would be more likely and would have no offsite consequences.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe purpose of the program is to define steps that a"
