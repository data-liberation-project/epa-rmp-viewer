This program systematically examines potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. The PHAs conducted included HAZOPS and What If Checklists methodologies and included a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team is tasked to identify, evaluate and make recommendations in the management of the potential hazards associated with the process. If possible, the team affects the changes necessary to mitigate the hazards identified. If the mitigation required is more involved or cannot be mitigated by the team, their findings are forwarded to management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHA to ensure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and that new hazards or previously unknown hazards can be dealt with. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Buckshot Treating Facility maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practices, and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by employees and management. The proc"

Covered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nThe Buckshot Treating Facility has developed and implemented safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practices to provide the control of hazards and to ensure the safety of employees and the public.\n\nTraining\nThe Buckshot Treating Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations at this facility. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\nContractors\nThe Buckshot Treating Facility uses Contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
