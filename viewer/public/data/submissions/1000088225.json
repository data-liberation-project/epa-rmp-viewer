They are subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance. To reduce confusion and to keep procedures and programs consistent all processes have been identified as Program Level 3 and developed as such.\r\n\r\nThis program was updated in June of 2020 to meet the required 5 year update and to make corrections as necessary. All elements have been updated.\r\n\r\nThe following areas are addressed in this summary:\r\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\r\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including\r\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures\r\n4.

All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\r\n\r\nThere are additional full time supervisors and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Manager that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to immediately report any condition that could result in an ammonia release. An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Tanimura and Antle's prevention program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Tanimura and Antle facility provides product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables and sometimes fruit. Both West and East Cooler fixed systems as well as portable equipment are on site and in operation from November through April. From April to late May, the facility (both fixed system and portable equipment) is not operating, but portable equipment remain on site. From Late May to September, both fixed systems and the portable ice maker is operational.

The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer or skid mounted and is used for pre-cooling and ice generation. Portable equipment varies in age. The ammonia equipment is located outside, in the Engine Rooms, or in the Refrigerated Rooms. The cold storage and processing systems are designed as per applicable mechanical, building and safety codes when constructed. The refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition, the West and East Cooler Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes, pressure will decrease, reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternative-Case Scenario.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nTanimura and Antle's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Tanimura and Antle is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\r\n\r\nKey objectives of Tanimura and Antle's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\r\n\r\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration"

The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Tanimura and Antle.\r\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.\r\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. Tanimura and Antle certifies operators following completion of operator training and Tanimura and Antle's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.\r\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. \r\nSecond, all Tanimura and Antle employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. \r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure.\r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.

The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.\r\nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. \r\n7) Verification of Tanimura and Antle's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Tanimura and Antle personnel. Tanimura and Antle has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings that the audit may find.\r\n8) Minimize employee injury and illness.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere were no reportable ammonia releases at this facility during the last 5 years that meet the\r\nFederal regulations.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has trained personnel to implement the Emergency Action Plan developed for this facility for flammables, fire, earthquake, hazardous materials, and other emergencies. Facility personnel have coordinated with responding outside agencies such as Yuma Fire and the local LEPC. The facilities emergency action plan has been coordinated with the community plan which includes these agencies. The facility has coordinated with outside parties through drills and attendance at Ammonia Safety Days. Facility personnel have exchanged data with local environmental authorities, fire and contractors who might assist during an emergency. In addition, Fire Department personnel have toured the facility on several occasions to get a better understanding of the processes and the facilities during an emergency such as fire, earthquake and or a chemical release. \r\n\r\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist facility personnel.

If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified at the facility.\r\n\r\nIncidental responders do not enter an IDLH condition. Personnel are trained to the Air Purifying Respirator level and trained to retreat at 300 PPM for ammonia. Facility personnel will assist outside agencies during larger releases. All personnel not trained to respond will evacuate to the meeting areas and be accounted for.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility. The prevention program has been updated as a result the 5-year program update requirement. Process hazard analysis studies have been conducted at Tanimura and Antle and the study team made recommendations for additional safety.\r\n\r\nReference the most recent Process Hazard Analysis which includes scheduled improvements to reduce accidental releases which are either in process, planned for at this time or have been completed."
