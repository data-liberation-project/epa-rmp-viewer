These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time supervisors and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Manager that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis.

The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition, the West and East Cooler Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore, as the refrigerant escapes, pressure will decrease, reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternative-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTanimura and Antle's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).

The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).

Tanimura and Antle certifies operators following completion of operator training and Tanimura and Antle's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities. \n\nSecond, all Tanimura and Antle employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. \n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure.\n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.
