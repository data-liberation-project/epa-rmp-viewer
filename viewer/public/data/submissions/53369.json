Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies We at Jarden Zinc Products, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety, This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in a single use.  Chlorine is used for wastewater treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360,000 pounds.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the calculations derived from the RMP*Comp software program supplied by EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne or more alternative release scenarios have been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlo"
