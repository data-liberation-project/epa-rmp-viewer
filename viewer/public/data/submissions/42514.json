The facility crushes grapes in order to produce wine, distilled spirits, and juice for concentrate.  These products are stored prior to shipment to other Gallo facilities for further processing and distribution.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                               The facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion.\n \n     The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\n \n1.  The receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped in to the chiller shell.  \n \n2.  Product is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigerant, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.  \n \n3.  The compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge it to the evaporative condenser (cooling tower).\n \n4.  In the eva"
