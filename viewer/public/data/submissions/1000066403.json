It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA Emergency Planning regulations, OAR 437-002-0042.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Astoria Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Bornstein Seafoods and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n- Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n- Safe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n- Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Astoria Fire Department. All Bornstein Seafoods personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. This plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Bornstein Seafoods.\n\n1.70\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time. Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are completed on the regulatory interval to assess the potential hazards of the system and to effectively close recommendations produced from the study."

Release scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  The report includes estimates for residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBornstein Seafoods complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\nBornstein Seafoods' written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary by the Bornstein Seafoods. \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considerations. Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n1.50\tFive"

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.10\tAccidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Bornstein Seafoods refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant.  Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Bornstein Seafoods to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR 437-002-0042. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n1.20\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\nBornstein Seafood is a manufacturing facility that packages and freezes seafood.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the fish.  This refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, which is the regulated substance on-site.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 15,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  There is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n1.30\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s"
