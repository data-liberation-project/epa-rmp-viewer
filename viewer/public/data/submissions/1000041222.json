There have been only two minor accidental releases in the past five years from the covered process.  The first accident involved a release of methane gas for five minutes.  The accident injured three onsite personnel and resulted in onsite and offsite property damage.  Offsite responders were notified and responded.  Many changes were introduced at the plant as a result of the accident; including improved/upgraded equipment and revised maintenance, training, and operation procedures.  In addition, a revised emergency response plan was also introduced.     \r\n\r\nThe second accident involved a 3-5 second release of y-grade condensate. This accident injured one onsite contractor and resulted in minor onsite property damage.  Offsite responders were not notified.  However, several changes were introduced as a result of the accident; including revised maintenance, training, and operating procedures.  \r\n\r\nNeither accident resulted in an onsite death or an offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nTarga's Chester Gas Plant is a Non-Res"

The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs. However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \r\n\r\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Chester Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).

The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\nThe Chester Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Chester Gas Plant is located near Chester, Oklahoma in Woodward County. Targa treats the entire gas plant as one process with 392,655 lbs of flammable substances. The facility operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\r\n\r\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\r\n2. Condensate\r\n3. Residue Gas\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) RESULTS\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels at the gas plant were evaluated for the offsite consequence analysis.  There is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Chester Gas Plant.  A vapor could explosion involving 120,450 pounds (30,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in an intermediate pressure flash tank (V-110).  This is the largest"
