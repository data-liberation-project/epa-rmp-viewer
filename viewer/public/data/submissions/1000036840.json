As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delano Farms Plant 1 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n1.1\tDELANO FARMS PLANT 1, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delano Farms Plant 1 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\nProcess Name \tProcess Chemical\tProcess Quantity(lbs)\r\nNorth System\tAmmonia (Anhydrous)\t49,000\r\nSouth System\tAmmonia (Anhydrous)\t12,000\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\nDelano Farms Plant 1 has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have:"

The facility has two (2) ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  The rooms are equipped with bunker style and ceiling suspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \r\nThe systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils located behind bunker walls in the cold rooms.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the suction accumulators, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the suction accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer ve"

      "SummaryText": "ssel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.     \r\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency control box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\nBoth of the ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated at one process.\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nDelano Farms Plant 1 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delano Farms Plant 1 facility is an integral"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delano Farms Plant 1 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\nFor the future, Delano Farms Plant 1 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Delano Farms Plant 1 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Delano Farms Plant 1 will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
