      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Webberville RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Webberville Wholesale Fertilizer is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies.  The facility began operations in 1984.  Key personnel at the Webberville facility are Mel Hahn, facility manager and John Stefanelli, operations manager.\n\nThe facility manufacturers a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 20,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe facility occupies approximately fifteen acres and is situated just north of I-96 on M-52, in Leroy Township, Ingham County, Michigan.  The facility is located north of an adjacent industrial park and south of the ADM Countrymark Grain Elevator.  There is one residence on the northwest side of the facility, about 200 yards away.  The nearest neighbor to the east is one mile.  There are a couple of homes on the northeast side, about a = mile away.  To the southwest, there is one unoccupied residence about a = mile away.\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material involved in this process is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous mem"

Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers from the bulk storage tank to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These \"events\" are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards\nThe worst case scenario for this facility was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.  A complete release of the tank contents (120,000 pounds -- creating a gas / vapor cloud) in a 10 minute period, using worst case atmospheric conditions, results in a distance to endpoint of 3.60 miles.  The estimated exposed population is 2500 people.  This distance would encompass the village of Webberville, its schools and government offices.  No hospitals, p"

There are no passive mitigation systems available for this type of scenario.\n\nIt is our belief that the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infinitesimally small.  Active mitigation systems in place at this facility were designed to prevent or mitigate any attempts to empty the tank.  The tank is in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a tanker truck transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is 12,000 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about ten minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 4.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be 0.20 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be the few residences and establishments  to the immediate southwest, northeast and northwest sides of the facility.  \n\nActive mitigation systems were included in the alternative case scenario.  They are listed in the next section.\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented.\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  Passive mitigation systems in place at the Webberville facility are:\n7 Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n7 Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tank. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would pre"

Active mitigation systems in place at the Webberville facility are:\n7 Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tank.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n7 Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.\n7 Pressure-relief valves (four) are located on the top of the bulk storage tank, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\n7 An emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the bulk storage tank activates the emergency shutoff valves (\"snappy joes\") on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n7 An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a 30,000 gallon water tank and a nearby 25,000 sq. ft. pond to help knock down a vapor cloud.\n7 Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n7 Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral"
