We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Henderson Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. \n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  We have these passive and active mitigation devices including excess flow valves, relief valves, check valves, and manual shut-off valves.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.\n\nWe comply with all applicable state codes and regulations and have attended Ammonia Safety and Maintenance School sponsored by the Nebraska Fertilizer Ag-Chem Association.\n\nWe never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program is in the event of an emergency involving our ammonia anhydrous system, it is our policy to notify the Henderson Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department:  members of the fire department have inspected our system.  The facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are "
