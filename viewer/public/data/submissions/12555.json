The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of toxic substances is a failure of rail car full of acryonitrile stored on the rail siding inside the APMC site. A full railcar of 170,000 pounds is asumed to be released to the ditch along side the rail tracks resulting in a toxic vapor cloud that goes beyond the site boundary.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nThe worst-case scenario, as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of a flammable is in the tank storage area is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a maximum inventory of a dimethylamine storage tank.  A full tank of 235,000 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE that goes beyound the site boundary.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nAn alternative case scenario (ACS)  for flammable substance at this facility is a liquid hydrogen release due to break in piping.  The hydrogen evaporates, then catches fire.  This alternate case has off site effects."

It takes 60 minutes to stop evaporation and remediate the spill.

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally an onsite HAZWOPER team is trained to respond to emergencies and assist community responders.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture specialty chemicals.  Seven chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  APMC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u0012s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).
