Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture specialty chemicals.  Seven chemicals in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  APMC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacture of specialty chemicals.  These specialty chemicals are used by our customers to manufacture other product used in a variety of application.  Raw materials are received at our plant by rail car, bulk tank truck, drums and pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feed stock is then fed to vessels.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat and hydrogen, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into product crude.  The product crude is then purified via"

The pure product is then stored in tanks on site and shipped to customers via rail car, bulk tank truck, tote bins or drums. \n\nThere are seven regulated substances handled at this facility.  The maximum amount of each substance at this facility is:\n\n  200,000 pounds of acrylonitrle\n  200,000 pounds of cyclohexylamine \n  235,000 pounds of dimethylamine\n  120,000 pounds of ethylamine\n   125,000 pounds of formaldehyde\n    20,000 pounds of hydrogen\n  150,000 pounds of methylamine\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\", as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of toxic substances is a failure of rail car full of acryonitrile stored on the rail siding inside the APMC site. A full railcar of 170,000 pounds is asumed to be released to the ditch along side the rail tracks resulting in a toxic vapor cloud that goes beyond the site boundary.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. \n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\", as defined by the EPA, associated with a release of a flammable is in the tank storage area is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving a maximum inventory of a dimethylamine storage tank.  A full tank of 235,000 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE that goes beyound the site boundary.  Although we have active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nAn \"alternative case scenario\" (ACS)  for flammable substance at this facility is a liquid hydrogen release due to break in piping.  The hydrogen evaporates, then catches fire.  This alternate case has off site effects.    \n\n"

The plant takes 10 minutes to stop the leak and 60 minutes to get emergency help to stop evaporation and remediate the spill.

It takes 60 minutes to stop evaporation and remediate the spill.  The resulting vapor cloud has off site effects.\n\nAn ACS for the toxic cyclohexylamine is a loading hose fails, leaking cyclohexylamine into a containment area for 10 minutes.  It takes 60 minutes to stop evaporation and remediate the spill. The resulting vapor cloud has off site effects.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of toxics or flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHAs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Additionally an onsite HAZWOPER team is trained to respond to emergencies and assist community responders.
