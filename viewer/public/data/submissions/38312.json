We are committed to a safe operation from our management team. We understand the importance of proper maintenance of our system. Regular inspections are performed to insure that the system is in a safe and effiecent operating mode at all times. Our in house audits insure that each employee is performing at our highest standards. Any findings are reported and corrected on a timely basis. A process hazard analysis was performed and all finding were addressed and corrected. Each year this analysis is reviewed and revalidated. Any unsafe senarios will be revealed through this process. Any process changes will trigger a new PHA for that section of the system. All sections of the CalARP program is reviewed regularly and is part of our employee training program.",

      "SummaryText": "    1.0  OVERVIEW\n\n1.1        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis technical assessment was conducted to fulfill the Hazard Assessment (off-site consequence analysis) requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5) for the P&O Cold Logistics - Modesto facility.  There have been numerous owners of the facility since operations began in 1945, with P&O Cold Logistics assuming ownership in Fall 2003.  \n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is ammonia.  The facility uses approximately 80,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler/freezer storage, and glycol underfloor heating.\n\nBased on regulatory requirements, 200 ppm was used as a toxic endpoint to quantify the off-site impact for the facility, which provides an estimate of concentration ranges within which adverse health effects can be observed.  Table 1-1 summarizes the maximum downwind distances and the estimated residential populations that are at risk of being exposed to a concentration of 200 ppm for each release.  The residential population at-risk numbers are the estimated number of people living within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions.\n\n    TABLE 1-1  Summary of Maximum Downwind Distances and At-Risk Populations\n\n\nRelease Scenario    \nLevel of Concern    \nMaximum Downwind Distance    \nPopulation at Risk\n\nWorst Case    \n200 ppm    \n1.7 Miles    \n37,592\n\nAlternative Release    \n200 ppm    \n0.2 Miles    \n291"
