This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe South East Kern River Cogen (SEKR Cogen) is located at 3500 Alfred Harrell Highway, north east of the town of Bakersfield, California within the South East Kern River oilfield.  The facility was designed and constructed by Shell Oil in 1988, and operated by Shell and its affiliates until aquired by Texaco in April of 1999. In October 2001 Chevron and Texaco merged and SEKR came under the ownership of CHEVRONTEXACO Inc.\n\nThe SEKR Cogen consists of three gas turbines, which drive electric generators rated to produce 27 megawatts of electric power.  Heat recovery steam generators are connected to the turbines.  In the steam generators, waste heat from the turbine exhaust is exchanged with water producing about 10,000 barrels of steam per day. The electric power generated by the facility is used to supply internal load requirements for Texaco and neighboring properties.  Excess power is sold to the utility grid.  The steam generated by the facility is used for enhanced oil recovery projects. \n\nAs part of the air permit issued by the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, the LM2500 turbine has a two step process to limit Nox emissions.

      "SummaryText": "In the first step, demineralized water is injected into the combustion chamber of the turbine, reducing combustion temperatures and Nox formation.  In the second step, a small concentration of ammonia is mixed into the turbine exhaust gas which then flows across a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst where Nox and ammonia chemically react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  The amount of ammonia used is maintained by a computer control system based upon a preset ammonia feed rate.  \n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon pressurized storage tank with an inventory limit of 10,200 gallons.  The storage tank is operated at about 50 psig and is designed to withstand a pressure of 300 psig.  The 300 psig design condition is well in excess of that which can be caused by atmospheric heating.  The storage tank is protected by two 300 psig relief valves, one of which is always in service.  Ammonia vapor is withdrawn from the top of the storage tank and fed to an intermediate accumulator where the pressure is held at about 30 psig.  The pressure in the storage tank is prevented from falling below the minimum pressure set point by two liquid ammonia evaporators.  The ammonia is fed from the accumulator, diluted with air to a concentration of less than two percent by volume, and is then injected into the turbine exhaust.  \n\nThe storage tank is refilled three to four times a year, depending on consumption.  At that time, a tank truck of ammonia is connected to the storage tank's liquid loading and vapor return lines. The lines are protected by pull-away valves and excess flow check valves.  In addition, the liquid loading line has a check valve to prevent reverse flow from the storage tank to the tank truck.  \n\n\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n \nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the SEKR Cogen.  Because the ammonia process at the facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "

In addition, the SEKR Cogen maintains information on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  \n \nTraining:\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the SEKR Cogeneration Plant has implemented a refresher training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., oral tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically read and revalidate the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted every year.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors:\n\n SEKR Cogen uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The basic aspects of this program are outlined in Mechanical Integrity - Element 8 of the facility Process Safety Management Plan and include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests using the D7i CMMS System of PM/PDM, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n \nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that all equipment functions as intended and that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if situation presents an immediate safety concern), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary. \n \nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The SEKR Cogen incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n \nSafe Work Practices:\n\nThe SEKR Cogen has long-standing safe work practices in place to help provide worker and process safety.  Examples of these incl"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help perform operations and maintenance activities safely.\n \nManagement of Change:\n\nThe SEKR Cogen has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the process. This system, described in Management of Change - Element 10 of the facility Process Management Safety Program, requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \nIncident Investigation:\n\nThe SEKR Cogen promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  SEKR Cogen's program for investigating incidents is described in Incident Investigation - Element 11 of the facility Process Management Safety Program. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent "

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \nCompliance Audits:\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the SEKR Cogen is periodically audited to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  SEKR Cogen's audit program is detailed in Compliance Audits - Element 13 of the facility Process Management Safety Program. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n \nThe ammonia process at the SEKR Cogen presents hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.  The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of ammonia from the facility.\n \nUniversal Prevention Activities:\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the ammonia process at the SEKR Cogen.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accid"

Maintenance and testing of equipment in the ammonia system is in accordance with the SEKR Cogen ammonia system maintenance procedures.  The procedures involve scheduled inspections and testing for the storage vessel, the relief and excess flow valves, the sensing switches, and all associated safety equipment. \n \nDesign and Construction Features:\n\nThe system design philosophy for the SEKR Cogen focused on minimizing the risk of an ammonia release by assuring conservative design of the system components.  Only new, first quality equipment and materials were used.  They were assembled in accordance with local, state and federal regulations, and applicable industry fabrication standards and codes. \n \nThe design features that assure the safety of the system include:\n1) The installation of relief and backup relief valves, rupture disks, and excess flow valves. \n2) Design of the ammonia storage vessel to withstand pressures 10% higher than required by code\n3) Welded and flanged construction, with upgraded corrosion allowances, and heavy-duty schedule\n4) Design of the system to meet and exceed earthquake, wind and flood standards\n5) Emergency alarms and shutdowns\n6) Site security including enclosure fencing and controlled access gates to prevent unauthorized personnel entry and vandalism\n7) Emergency beacons and windsocks to alert technicians and plant visitors to the development of a hazardous condition.  \n \nOperational Procedures\n\n The plant has a series of operational procedures to handle ongoing operations, repairs and maintenance.  A very detailed and comprehensive procedure is in place and followed for the off-loading of Ammonia, as a leak or accident during off-loading activities is considered the most likely type of incident the facility could encounter.

      "SummaryText": "\n \nMonitors and Alarms:\n\nThe ammonia system is monitored and controlled by a digital computer based control system.  The control system responds to changes in temperature, pressure, level and flow to maintain these process variables within predetermined limits.  The computer initiates alarms when conditions are not at or beyond process limits to alert the operator.  The computer also initiates corrective actions or equipment shutdown.  The operator may assume manual control of the process at any time.  Manual control by the operator does not bypass any safe operating shutdowns.\n \n\n  Five-Year Accident History\n\nTo CHEVRONTEXACO's knowledge, the SEKR Cogen has a spotless record of accident prevention over the past 5 years, as no accidents or releases of ammonia have occurred from the facility.  CEVRONTEXACO will investigate any future incidents very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. \n \n  Emergency Response Planning\n\nThe SEKR Cogen maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties.  \n \nThe emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the process or management.  The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel of  the changes.\n \nEmergency response for the SEKR Cogen has been coordinated with the Kern County and City of Bakersfield Fire Departments and the Region 5 Inland South Local Emerge"
