      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for Hilo facility of BEI Hawaii, formerly know as Brewer Environmental Industries, LLC to address one of the six warehouses statewide.  BEI Hawaii developed this site specific Risk Management Plans for BEI Hawaii?s facility that are regulated under risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the general public, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle pesticides, fertilizers, and industrial chemicals.  The volume of chlorine stored at this site is above the specified threshold quantity that requires facilities to comply with the Risk Management Program Rule (40-CFR 68) and to develop and implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to worker health and to nearby members of the community.  It is BEI?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  \n\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meeting all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to Chief Executive Officer of the company, or designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.   The purpose of the polic"

      "SummaryText": "y is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environmental from pollutions.  BEI Hawaii has a written Safety and Health Program.  This program identifies the responsible parties, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  Specifically, Section 10 of this program document addresses Accident Prevention, Reporting and Recordkeeping and Section 14 addresses Emergency Response.  Section 14 was based on the Chlorine Institute, Inc. Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. \n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe BEI Hawaii - Hilo facility is located at 60 Kuhio Avenue, Hilo, Hawaii.  The facility stores pesticides, fertilizers and industrial chemicals.  The products are warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout the Big Island.  The regulated substance handled at this storage/distribution facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 150-lb and 1-ton Department of Transportation (DOT) approved cylinders.  BEI Hawaii receives chlorine from a chemical supplier and distributor located on the west coast.  The chlorine supplier is responsible for container inspection and maintenance.  On average, the BEI Hawaii facility stores approximately 40,000 lbs chlorine (this value can increase to ~70,000 lbs chlorine depending on shipping schedules).  Because bulk sales are made directly to customers, access to the facility is not restricted.\n\n3.  Release Scenario\n\nWorst-case release scenario ? failure of a 1-ton chlorine cylinder releases 2,000 pounds of chlorine within a 10-minute time frame.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as a dense vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint (for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L [~3 ppm]) was predicted to be 1.3 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMPComp (version 1.06) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming worst-case meteorology of 1.5 m/s stabilit"

It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as a dense vapor cloud.  The ERPG-2 toxic endpoint (for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L [~3 ppm]) was predicted to be 0.2 miles downwind of the facility.  The EPA model RMP*Comp was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance assuming average meteorology of 3.0 m/s stability class D, no mitigation measures, and that the material is stored as liquid under pressure.\n\nThe BEI Hawaii facility maintains two chlorine container emergency kits (one ?A? kit for 150 lb cylinders and one ?B? kit for 2,000 lb cylinders), and has a chlorine recovery vessel (chlorine coffin).  The Hilo Fire Department also maintains ?A? and ?B? kits and a chlorine recovery vessel.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\nThe facility complies with applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  The facility maintains a Process Safety Management Plan that was developed and is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  The BEI Hawaii Process Safety Management Plan addresses:\n?process safety information (includes information on first aid and medical management procedures for chlorine)\n?process hazard analysis\n?operating procedures (including safe handling procedures for storage and loading)\n?training (including leak mitigation)\n?contractors\n?pre-startup review\n?mechanical integrity\n?hot work permits\n?management change\n?emergency planning and response (includes information on accident investigation and employee participation \n?compliance safety audits\n\n5.

      "SummaryText": "onse Program\n\nThe BEI Hawaii ? Hilo facility is classified as a non-responding facility.  As such, BEI Hawaii has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee/community safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response with an in-house response team.  The BEI Hawaii - Hilo Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in the BEI Hawaii Safety and Health Program incorporating information from Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  BEI Hawaii has coordinated response to incident involving chlorine with the Hawaii Fire Department Hazmat Team located in Hilo.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \n\nBEI Hawaii ? Hilo facility personnel will only perform defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate water spray, etc.,) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this program with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Hilo Fire Department.  In addition, BEI Hawaii has arranged with local response contractors to deal with potential chlorine releases at the facility. \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no current plans to change storage practices at this facility. Chlorine use for swimming pools and sewage treatment is anticipated to diminish over the next few years as new disinfections methods are employed.  BEI Hawaii has already experienced reduced levels of chlorine at its facilities as a result of its efforts to educate and switch customers from chlorine gas to sodium hypochlorite (bleach)"
