The main plant is located just within the Reedley city limit, to the northwest of town at Reed and South Avenues, and a maintenance facility is located just outside of the city limit to the northeast of town, on Buttonwillow and South Avenues. The refrigeration facility includes a pre-cooler and cold storage warehouse with 2,500 tons of cooling capacity for storage and shipment of produce. The original ammonia-based refrigeration system was erected in 1972 and the existing facility was completely updated and expanded in 1984.\n\nIto Packing Company is committed to receiving, storing and operating the ammonia refrigeration and propane systems in a manner that is safe to the operators and friendly to the environment. It is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthful environment and to follow operating practices. This program is vigorously endorsed to prevent injuries or accidents and to avoid the suffering and economic loss associated with the accidents.\n\nBy virtue of the hazardous and flammable effects associated with ammonia and propane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Safety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle hazardous substances as well as on the various safety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Furthermore,"

      "SummaryText": " comprehensive training received by our employees adds to the inherent safety of our distribution facility.\n\nOur Risk Management Program (RMP) is based upon the federal standard outlined in OSHA's Process Safety Management (OSHA 3132) and NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook / Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures / How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires / OTHER STANDARD or GUIDELINE. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of propane, if a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Reedley City and Fresno County Fire Dept, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nThe intent of Ito Packing Company is to maintain only one Risk Management program which will include the requirements of OSHA, EPA and Cal ARP. This program is referred to as the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan, or the PSM/RMP program. The PSM/RMP program covers both components and systems as it relates to anhydrous ammonia and propane. \n\n2. PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is acutely hazardous and propane a flammable material as defined by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA 40 CFR 68. The threshold quantity for these materials is established in appendix A of OSHA 1910.119 at 10,000-pounds. The CalARP program establishes a 500-pound threshold quantity. The Ito Packing Company system is thus subject to the requirements of both the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, the Process Safety Management Standard and the Cal ARP requirements.\n\nThe two materials are 72,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is required for the operation of the cold storage units; and 80,000 lbs of propane, which is used strictly for filling the fuel tanks of forklifts and ranch vehicles.\n\nThe ammonia storage/receiver tank is located in a secured area authorized for technicians only. The propane is stored in 2 tanks on the eastside of the plant and access to this site is restricted to authorized facility"

The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe have calculated the worst case release scenarios based on the RMP Comp off-sight consequences model downloaded from the federal Environmental Protection Agency @ www.epa.gov/ceppo/\n\nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Program 1 process. Our main receiver tank is filled to 80% capacity. Which calculates to 72,000 pounds. If the site column (protected by barriers and guards) was somehow broken off, the tank could possibly release the entire contents.\n\nIn the event of a release, in this case, a worst case scenario, the ammonia would release in two forms: liquid and gas. Of the liquid portion released it would create a white vapor cloud and strong ammonia odor. A portion of the liquid, about 25% would vaporize immediately - the remaining liquid will accumulate into very cool pools of liquid. The ammonia gas released is lighter than air and will be carried by air movement and rise slowly into the atmosphere. \n\nUnder wind conditions and atmosphere, the end point of such a release would reach 2.3 miles from its origin. In the case of the main plant, the end point of the vapor would reach the entire circumference of the city, except on the very south end of town, where it would dissipate at about Cricket Hollow or the length of Olson Avenue.    \n\nPropane is classified as a Program 1 process.  The worst case scenario considered for this process involves a release of 38,400 lb. of propane from our Tank 1.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of is 0.10 miles.  This distance is less than the distance to th"

If a pop-off occurred, and the device failed to open, the result would be release of 25 pounds of ammonia into the atmosphere over a period of one minute - reaching an end point of 1/10th of a mile. There are no public receptors within this distance.\n\nFor an alternative propane release - occurring during the filling of the tank, a small amount could be released due to operator error. As previously noted in the worst case scenario, any amount does not reach a public receptor. \n\n4. The Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nIto Packing Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\nIto Packing Company maintains a detailed record of written safety information, which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all aspects of our distribution facility.  \n\nHazard Review\nA checklist methodology is used to carry out hazard reviews at our facility. The reviews focus on operating procedures, equipment functions and handling practices to identify possible hazards.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ito Packing Company maintains written operating procedures, computerized monitoring of ammonia refrigeration systems a"
