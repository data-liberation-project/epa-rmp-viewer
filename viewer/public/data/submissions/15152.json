These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurence and minimize the consequences of significant releases as well as fires, explosions, and other types of accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and can also avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage,  handling, or on-site movement.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process\n\nThe safety programs are implemented in order to reduce both the number and severity of accidents. Our focus is on the policy, procedures, and safe practices that govern individual processes and acitivities on specific equipment.  These programs are communicated and accepted by every employee at this facility.\n\nDescription:\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid.  It is classified as a closed system process.  The total ammonia inventory on site includes 37,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used in the freezing of broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, beans, pasta, asparagus, and for cold storage.\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nFailure of the high-pressure reciever containing 37,000 pounds of ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 37,000 pounds of the vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a ten-minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, amm"

Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and environment.  The 1/4 pipe was chosen because it is used to temporaily bleed off a pump so that maintenance activites can be conducted.  This scenario is unlikely to occur due to the following reasons:\na.  the pump is isolated with valves in the closed position so that only a few pounds of ammonia would be released\nb.  the valves of the pump would have to completely fail\nc.  the facility has an accident prevention program in place that establishes operational procedures that\n     include a requirement that personnel  be present at all times during maintenance of the pumps\nd.  mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance of the pump at the facility\ne.  routine inspections and testing of valves\nf.  replacement of defective equipment\ng.  facility emergency response plan at the facility\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia specific prevention steps was developed as a requirement and is in compl"
