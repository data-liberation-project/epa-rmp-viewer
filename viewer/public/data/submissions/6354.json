The site has one toxic chemical, Methyl Chloride, which is above the Risk Management reporting threshold.  The Site also uses several flammable chemicals, five of which are covered RMP chemicals.  Specific details of the chemicals and impact distances are in the Risk Management plan submitted to the EPA and emergency responders in the Deer Park / LaPorte Texas area.  Additionally, the site participated in voluntary public information dissemination activities where the stakeholders -- neighboring plants, public officials and general public -- were invited and educated on the Risk Management Plan.  The impacts of both Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios were presented in oral, printed and graphical forms in three separate public events in the Pasadena and LaPorte areas.  Copies of the printed materials, beyond the required RMP submittals, have been given to the LaPorte and Deer Park LEPC's, as well as neighboring schools and area libraries.  The site keeps copies of the submitted materials for interested parties.  \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario reported per the RMP regulation for flammable chemicals has the theoretical potential to impact surrounding facilities (chemical manufacturing facilities) and the public access state highway (State Highway 143 - Battleground Road) that is adjacent to the facility.  The Alternate Release Scenario is predicted to impact only the site and vacant land directly adjacent to the site.  \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for the toxic chemical located on the site can theoretically impact neighboring facilities, State Highway 143 (Battleground Road), State Highway 225 (LaPorte Freeway) and neighboring industrial and light industrial businesses.  \n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for the toxic chemical is predicted to impact an area n"

Examples of activities under the program include trained personnel operating and maintaining our processes, cooperative industry response alliances (Channel Industries Mutual Aid or CIMA) and close interaction with Community response agencies (LEPC, Fire Departments).  The storage of chemicals on site is minimized and chemicals are kept on site on an as needed basis.  \n\nFail safe systems are installed to protect our personnel as well as the public from effects of release or impacts of on site chemicals.  Personnel are trained to quickly respond to mitigate damage to personnel, public and property.  A community notification system is in place and personnel are trained to inform the public of any incident or event that has an impact or possible effect with an emphasis on public protection.\n\nThere have been no releases of RMP, SARA or CERCLA reportable toxic or flammable chemicals in the five-year accident history of the plant.\n\nAs a mitigation measure, the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan which has been developed based on best management practices, regulatory requirements, voluntary compliance programs (OSHA VPP, ISO 14001), corporate guidance and industry sharing of experience.  The plan includes specific response to many possible emergency and release scenarios.  The plan is refined continually as a result of practice and drills, including critiques by outside experts and community advice.  \n\nThe site is strengthening its safety program via participation in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program, its environmental program by maintaining its ISO 14000 certificat"
