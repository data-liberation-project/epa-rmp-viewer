These documents are considered working programs and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases.  \n\n          Emergency response policies for the facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.120(q) \"Emergency Response to Hazardous Releases\", 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\", 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management\", and 40 CFR Part 68 \"Risk Management Program\".  Integration of these programs for the Upstate Niagara Cooperative, Inc. facility increases the usefullness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Upstate Niagara Cooperative, Inc. performs only secondary emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel.  Local and private emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.  \n\n         The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additional off-site considerations covered in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental release prevention program.
