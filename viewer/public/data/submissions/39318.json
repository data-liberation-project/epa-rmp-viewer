All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\nThe facility uses chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharging into the Mud Creek.  Thr facility services the City of Valdosta area, south of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and east of Forrest Avenue.  The chlorination process includes chlorine cylinders (pressurized ), chlorination equipment, electrical equipment and process specific safety equipment.\nAccidental release modeling was performed for the area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release.  The 'worst case scenario', defined by EPA, states \" the owner or operator shall assume that the \u00bfmaximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes\".  The 'alternate case scenario' is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worse-case release scenario\".  An incident history review was performed to identify the most likely case scenario.\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Modeling was used for the area to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint'.  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \" the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threaten health effects\".  The residential population within a perimeter corres"

      "SummaryText": "ponding to toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  \nThe worst case release scenario for Mud Creek WPCP involves a failure of a one-ton cylinder yielding a cumulative release of 2,000 lbs of chlorine.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling for this unlikely scenario was performed using EPA RMP Comp, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles was obtained.\nThe alterative release scenario for Mud Creek WPCP involves mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection (pigtail) allowing the accidental release of one-ton cylinder of chlorine over a one hour period.  Similar atmospheric modeling per the RMP*CompTM. Modeling yields a more likely figure of 0.1 mile affected radius under normal atmospheric conditions.  There were no receptors identified within the radius.  In support of the probability that a worst case accidental release will not occur, a review pf process history indicates that no reportable accidental release (greater than a 10 lb quantity) has occurred within the past five years.\nThe Mud Creek WPCPs' Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\nOPERATOR TRAINING,\nPREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM,\nPROCESS SPECIFIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT,\nSAFE & EFFECTIVE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES, WRITTEN WITH OPERATOR PARTICIPATION,\nHAZARD REVIEW OF EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURES,\nAUDITING & INSPECTION PROGRAMS and\nCOMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nFurther, Mud Creek WPCP has an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process:\nCHLORINE DETECTORS,\nCHEMICAL RIGHT - TO - KNOW PROGRAM and\nPERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT PROGRAM\nThe Mud Creek WPCP use the Valdosta Fire Department for emergency response responsibilities, coordinated with the Lowndes Emergency Management Agency.
