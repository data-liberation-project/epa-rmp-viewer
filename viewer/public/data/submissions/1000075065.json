The following is a list of RMP toxic and flammable substances stored at the NCP - East Site:\r\n \r\nFlammables:\r\n-  Acetylene;\r\n-  Hydrogen;\r\n-  Butene;\r\n-  1,3 Butadiene;\r\n-  Ethane;\r\n-  Ethylene;\r\n-  Propylene;\r\n-  Propane;\r\n-  Multiple Flammable Mixtures;\r\n \r\nToxics:\r\n-  Cyclohexylamine.\r\n\r\nThis document provides an overview of various RMP activities at NCP, including the following:\r\n\r\n-  A list of RMP regulated substances;\r\n-  A five-year history of RMP accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\r\n-  An overview of emergency response; and \r\n-  An overview of the RMP Accident Prevention Program. \r\n\r\nHSSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND THE RMP PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe Norco Chemical Plant (NCP) - East Site maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program's elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.  For a detailed description of the RMP Prevention Program, refer to Section 7 of the Risk Management Plan submission. The following is a summary of some of these measures:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis\r\n\r\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's"

PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed. PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved. PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years. Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following: (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate. \r\n\r\nOperator Training\r\n\r\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years. New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit. The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown. Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training. Operator training is required to be documented.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator. The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information. Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)"

In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place. The mechanical integrity program includes, for example, ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment. Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits\r\n\r\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process. The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.
