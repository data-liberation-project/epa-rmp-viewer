Based on this walkthrough, four recommendations were made and \nall of these recommendations have been implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n      Niklor has prepared written operating procedures for chlorine storage and \nhandling that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to \nchlorine. They are consistent with the chlorine safety information.   Written operating \nprocedures include delivery and storage of chlorine, problems, and remedies.\n\nTraining\n\n      \tNiklor Chemical Company ensures that each employee involved with the chlorine \nstorage and handling process, and each employee newly assigned to this process, is \ntrained and tested for competency in the operating procedures.  The Niklor Chemical \nCompany employee training documentation files include training records for each \nemployee assigned to chlorine storage and handling process.  The training ensures that \nthe employee has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the \nduties and responsibilities, including chlorine emergency response, as provided in the \noperating procedures.  Employee training includes as a minimum the following elements:\n\n*  Safety Information.\n*  Process Technology and Process Equipment, including safety systems.\n*  Ma"

In addition, Niklor Chemical Company will ensure that \noperators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after \nmajor modifications.\n\nContractors\n\n      Niklor Contractor procedures specify the information required to be provided to \nthe contractors performing work on or near the chlorine system, the training requirements \nfor contractor employees, and mechanism to obtain assurance from contractors that they \nhave informed their employees of the appropriate safety rules.  Niklor is required to \nprovide information and explanations concerning the hazards and processes, obtain, and \nevaluate information regarding the contractor's safety program. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n      Niklor has procedures in place to ensure that a pre-startup safety review is \nconducted prior to starting a new covered process or prior to making modifications to the \nchlorine system that require a Management of Change (MOC) procedure implementation.  \nThe required conditions prior to startup include:\n\n*  Construction and/or equipment are in accordance with design specifications.\n*  Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n*  A PHA has been performed for any new facilities and recommendations have been \nresolved or implemented prior to startup.\n*  At modified facilities, MOC requirements have been met.\n*  Training of each operating and maintenance employee involved in the process is complete.\n\n      These procedures ensure that no new/significantly modified process will start-up \nand no regulated substances wi"

This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to \ngo and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately \naddressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process \nis safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \n\n      Mechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance \nprocedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance \npersonnel.\n\n      Niklor operates a program that generates a task order for performance of the \npreventive maintenance routine after a designated time past the closing of the previous \ntask order for that maintenance.  Description of the work to be performed is included with \nthe printed work order.  In addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the \nGeneral Operation and Maintenance Manual. \n\n      Niklor Chemical Company will document inspection, testing, and maintenance of \nchlorine related equipment and assure the performance is done in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the manufacturer and industry groups.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\n      Hot work refers to work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or \nsimilar flame or spark producing operations.  The procedures call for the issuance of a hot \nwork permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorine railcars and other areas \ndeemed appropriate as described in the procedures.  Fire prevention and protection \nsystems are in place prior to the issuance of the hot work permit.  The permit indicates \nthe dates the work is authorized for, the location and specific operational requirements \nand is kept on file in the administrative office.\n\n      Niklor Chemical Company MOC procedures include steps required to be taken by \nplant personnel prior to implementing changes to chlorine equipment, procedures, raw \nma"
