      "SummaryText": "Great Lakes Cheese of Wisconsin processes a variety of cheese products at our facility in Plymouth. Great Lakes Cheese has a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at our facility as a refrigerant. Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our product coolers. The ammonia is\r\ncontained in a closed loop system. In other words, it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. Ammonia is a safe and efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n   Great Lakes Cheese takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) \r\n   which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on- \r\n   going integrity of the system. Only qualified contractors work on ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n   The Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Plymouth site.\r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n   The facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with both OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation. The program consists of the following \r\n   elements:\r\n   - Employee Participation Program\r\n   - Process Safety Information\r\n   - Process Hazard Analysis\r\n   - Operating Procedures\r\n   - Training Program\r\n   - Contractor Safety Program\r\n   - Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\n   - Mechani"
