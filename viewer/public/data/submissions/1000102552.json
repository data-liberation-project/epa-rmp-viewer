This terminal is propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes six (6) above-ground storage tanks with 30,000 gallon capacity each. It also has two Compressors and two Liquid Pumps.  The terminal has a siding with two (2) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of Compressors with vapor from the Storage Tanks. The facility also has two trucks load stations and one transport load station.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\r\nThe site and company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries, and releases at the facility. Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaining up to date procedures, and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter. The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines, and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance practices. The chemicals handled do not present significant internal corrosion hazards and corrosion to external surfaces of pipelines and storage tanks is minimized via inspection and painting programs.\r\n\r\nAs important as those previously mentioned items are, shutdown systems are also installed on site. Shutdown systems include remotely controlled, positive shutoff valves designed to shutdown affected equipment and isolate a problem once detected. Portable fire extinguishers are also available on-site for employee use.\r\n\r\nAs a corporation, AmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. AmeriGas also has seven Regional Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Manager, a Safety and Technology M"

These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also maintains an around-the-clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel as well as Chemtrec on any type of incident encountered at an AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\r\n\r\nThis distribution and storage facility is subject to and abides by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule for sites handling hazardous chemicals. In addition, the site complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58.\r\n\r\nAll of our AmeriGas transport drivers have been thoroughly trained in the terminal's loading and Emergency Action Plan procedures and many have also been trained using the National Propane Gas Association's (NPGA) Certified Employee Training Program (CETP).\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\nWorst Case Scenario \r\n\r\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity is the worst-case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe greatest amount of propane held is 30,000 Gallons or 110,000 lbs. The total quantity released was 110,000 lbs. The propane was assumed to disperse in the fla"

The ambient air temperature assumed is 25 deg C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was chosen. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure endpoint for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles.\r\n\r\nBroken or burst propane loading hoses were determined to be the most common failure. Pumps and Compressors were also considered. Maintenance and mitigation devices are in place that would mitigate the risks of release from pumps and compressors. Vessel overfilling is mitigated administratively. The storage tanks are filled only to a maximum of 85% of the total capacity to allow expansion of the product. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThough the site is classified as a non-responding facility, it maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP), complying with state of Florida regulations. Both plans include procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. Notification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. Should an actual incident occur, the plans five guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site.
