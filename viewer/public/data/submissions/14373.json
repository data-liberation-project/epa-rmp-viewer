The Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policy                                                                    Van Diest Supply Company's accidental release prevention policy is a unified approach that integrates technology, procedure, and management practices, while complying with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations for both our LP gas storage and our anhydrous ammonia storage.  If an accidental release of either substance were to occur, Van Diest Supply Company is prepared and trained to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.\n\nB.   A Brief Description of the Facility and the Substances Handled\nVan Diest Supply Company is a formulator, distributor, and dealer  of agricultural chemicals, and a dealer of fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application on the field.  Two 30,000 gallon vessels are used to store the anhydrous ammonia, with the largest amount in either vessel at any time 130,000 pounds (based on 85% fill limit).  \n\nVan Diest Supply Company uses propane as fuel for both our forklifts as well as some of our pickups.  The propane is stored in a single 30,000 gallon tank, which, when full, holds 107,000 pounds of propane (based on 85% fill limit).\n\nC.   The Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios  \nFor ammonia, our worst case release, as directed by the EPA, is a release of the entire contents of one storage tank in 10 minutes (130,000 lbs).  The distance to toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.40 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a failure in a 2 inch tank hose as the tank is being used, with the assumption that mitigation such as check valves would allow for only a 2 minute release.  The distance to toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.60 miles (11,908 lbs released).\n\nFor propane, the worst case release sc"

      "SummaryText": "enario is based on releasing the entire contents of the tank when filled to the greatest amount (85% full) in a vapor cloud explosion.  The endpoint (1 psi overpressure) is 0.38 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a pull-away incident that causes a failure in a break-away device.  The resulting release was assumed to last for 5 minutes and travel a distance of 0.27 miles.\n\nD.   The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nFor our ammonia tanks, Van Diest Supply Company implements the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Ammonia\".\n\nFor our propane usage, the system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58.  In addition, Van Diest Supply Company complies with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.110, for LP-Gas storage.\n\nE.   Five Year Accident History\nVan Diest Supply Company has never had an incident involving either propane or ammonia which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nF.   Emergency Response Program\nVan Diest Supply Company has the following: a written emergency action plan (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38); provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); and a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.  All of these have been coordinated with the Region V Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nIn addition, Van Diest Supply Company has a trained emergency response team (ERT) on-site capable of acting as first responder in the event of an incident with either of these two substances.  Our ERT team has trained and conducted drills with the Webster City "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Van Diest Supply Company.  Currently, we are working to improve and update the training program used for our employees who handle propane.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
