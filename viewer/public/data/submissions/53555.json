Because the anhydrous ammonia storage is in proximity of each other, the total amount of anhydrous ammonia that potentially could be released would amass to approximately 219,140 pounds (lbs). The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the following set of conditions.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenarios were performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 4.2 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 7,400 persons were obtained for the release scenario. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involved the release of each toxic substance stored at the facility. The amount of aldicarb released was predicted to be 250 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released was predicted to be 219,120 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 2.2 miles. The amount of aqueous ammonia released was predicted to be 20,300 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.56 miles. The amount of azinphos-methyl released was predicted to be 40 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of carbofuran released was predicted to be 493 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of dimethoate released was predicted to be 506 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of endosulfan released was predicted to be 1,150 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.1 miles. The amount of methamidophos released was predicted to be 714 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.23 miles. The amount of methomyl released"

The amount of phorate released was predicted to be 3,408 lbs and the distance to toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. The toxic concentration levels outside these endpoint distances are below the allowable standards for toxic substances established by AIHA. The typical meteorological conditions used for these scenarios was a Stability Class D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature, and average humidity.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\u00bf\tHigh level of training of the operators.\n\u00bf\tPreventative maintenance programs.\n\u00bf\tUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n\u00bf\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\u00bf\tPerformance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures.\n\u00bf\tImplementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThis facility will fully implement the RMP and will initiate appropriate changes as needed to maintain a safe operation."
