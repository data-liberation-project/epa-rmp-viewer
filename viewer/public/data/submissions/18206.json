As part\nof  this commitment, CFS has established a system to help  ensure\nsafe  operation of the processes at this facility.  One component\nof  this system is a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that helps manage\nthe  risks at CFS and that complies with the requirements of  the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR  part\n68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk  Management\nPrograms (the RMP rule).\n\nOne  of  the  requirements of the RMP rule is to  submit  a  risk\nmanagement  plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management  program\nat  CFS.   This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\n\nThe RMP program at CFS consists of three (3) elements:\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand:\n\n               The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical\n               accidental releases and;\n          l    accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years\n               associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n               (regulated substances).\n          \n2)   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the\n     processes  containing more than a threshold  quantity  of  a\n     regulated substance (covered processes).\n3)   An  emergency response program to help respond to accidental\n     releases of regulated sub"

In fact, CFS has  a\ncomprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of\nsafeguards against release of a hazardous substance and  injuries\nand damage to its employees, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Issue Date:\n   04/30/99\n\nCFS  limits  the  use of hazardous substances.   Before  using  a\nhazardous  substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.\nWhen a hazardous substance is used at CFS, consideration is given\nto  the  potential  for  this substance to adversely  affect  CFS\nworkers,  the public, and the environment and CFS takes steps  to\nprevent any such effects.\n\nCFS  prevents releases of the hazardous substances  used  at  the\nfacility.   When  a  hazardous substance  is  used  at  CFS,  the\nequipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the\nlikelihood  of  an accidental release.  Industry  and  government\nstandards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and\noperation of the equipment.\n\nCFS  limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  CFS\ntrains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing  the\nconsequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition,  CFS  works\nwith  the  local  fire  department and with the  local  emergency\nplanning  committee  (LEPC) to limit injuries  and  environmental\ndamage if a release does occur.\n\nThe  safety program at CFS consists of a number of elements, only\nsome  of  which  are required by the RMP rule.

Collectively, these  prevention  program\nactivities  help prevent potential accident scenarios that  could\nbe caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nCFS has safety features on many units to help:\n     Contain/control a release,\n     Quickly detect a release, and\n     Reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\nThe  following types of safety features are used in  the  covered\nprocesses.\nl    Release detection:  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\nl    Release  containment/control:  Process  relief  valves  that\n     discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n     Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n     Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g.,\n     high pressure and temperature).  Curbing or diking to contain\n     liquid releases.  Backup power equipment (e.g., 24-volt backup\n     power supply for process control system).  Atmospheric relief\n     devices."

There have been no\naccidents  or  incidents  in the past five  years,  resulting  in\noffsite effects.\n\n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe  Altamont Gas Processing Plant maintains a written  emergency\nresponse program, which is in place to protect worker and  public\nsafety,  as  well  as the environment.  The program  consists  of\nprocedures  for responding to a release of a regulated substance,\nincluding  the possibility of a fire or explosion if a  flammable\nsubstance  is accidentally released. The procedures  address  all\naspects  of  emergency response, including proper first  aid  and\nmedical  treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting\nfor   personnel  after  an  evacuation,  notification  of   local\nemergency response agencies and the public, if a release  occurs,\nand post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\nIn  addition,  the plant has procedures that address maintenance,\ninspection and testing of emergency response equipment (SPCC Plan\nProcedures),  as  well as instructions that address  the  use  of\nemergency  response  equipment.  Employees  receive  training  in\nthese procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency\nresponse  duties. The emergency response program is updated  when\nnecessary, based on modifications made to gas plant processes  or\nother CFS facilities.  The emergency response program changes are\nadministered  through  the  Plant Superv"
