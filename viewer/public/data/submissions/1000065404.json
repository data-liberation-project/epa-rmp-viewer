Quebrada Vueltas Sector Las Carolinas, Fajardo, Puerto Rico, 00738.  This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release:\n\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Regional Northeast Aqueduct Filtration Plant (Fajardo Nueva Filtration Plant) have different engineering controls.  The facility was constructed with safety controls that are part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\n\nRegional Northeast Aqueduct Filtration Plant (Fajardo Nueva Filtration Plant) is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is delivered from San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Regional Northeast Aqueduct Filtration Plant (Fajardo Nueva Filtration Plant) could have a storage maximum volume of 18,000 pounds distributed in nine (9) containers.  The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the ejectors and then the chlorine solution flow to three (3) different disinfecti"

This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the US Census 2010, it was identified that 5,281 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio. Environmental receptors, Such as beaches, rivers and wetlands, (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but through a valve seal rupture.  In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.2 miles for urban areas, no public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.

It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation, emergency personal protective equipment, preventive maintenance and audits. "
