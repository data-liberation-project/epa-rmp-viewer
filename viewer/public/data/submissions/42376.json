It is a standard surface waterplant utilizing coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Chlorine a regulated substance, is added to the final product for disinfection.\nChlorine from one ton conainers is used, With a maximum storage of 10,000 pounds. The chlorination system consists of two gas, vacuum operated, ton mounted regulators, one in service and the other on stand-by. The regulators will discontiinue the flow of chlorine gas sholud the operating vacuum be lost. When the in service container is empty, a vacuum type automatic switchover module, automatically transfers to  the stand-by container to allow for continous chlorination. Three rotameters control the rate of chlorine gas flow. The ejector supplies the vacuum needed for the sysstem to operae and eject chlorine gas into the supply water making a chlorine solution.\nFor accidential release prevention, there is a fully operational and enforced Process Safety Management Program, operating personnel perform daily inspections of chlorination equipment and the chlorine storage area, scheduled maintenance, in house and off-site training. Inspection of chlorine containers prior  to unloading and acceptance is completed. Drills may be conducted annually with the Hazardous Material Response Team and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planing Committee.\nThe worst case scenario, whie possible is not considered probable, is the total release of a one ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine at 2,000 pounds per minute for a one minute duration; the end-point distance would be 1.2 miles. The alternate release scenario is the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine at 163 pounds per minute for a 13 minute duration; the end-point distance would "
