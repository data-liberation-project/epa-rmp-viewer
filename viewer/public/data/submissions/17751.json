      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Program has been developed for Eckert Cold\nStorage Company located in Manteca, California.\nThe purpose of this RMP is to:\n* Increase the public health and the environment by insuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling acutely hazardous materials.\n* Assist Eckert Cold Storage Company and the local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling acutely hazardous materials.    The Risk Management Program addresses administration and operational programs designed to prevent HM related accidents and risks. Ammonia, which is used in the process handling of vegetables is the AHM of concern and the focus of this study.\nEckert Cold Storage utilizes a closed refrigeration system that contains 12,000 pounds of ammonia. The system cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system has a low pressure side or low side where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high Pressure or high side where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back to a liquid. ( In operation the system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side. ) Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulating enclosure where g goods are processed, chilled, or frozen. Eckert Cold Storage has operated in Manteca since 1970. There has not been a release of ammonia in the past five Years of operation. Eckert Cold Storage Company annually trains their employees. The  training includes operating Procedures' emergency response, prevention programs, and the business emergency action plan."
