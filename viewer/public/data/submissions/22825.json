In order to fulfill this mission, De Kam's provides an EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company.\n\n\n         This facility maintains approximatey eleven 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and zero 1500\n-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 52,000 pounds.\n\n\n          Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 1 stationary storage tank (s) [1@ 18,000 gallon]  on site.  84,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum"

      "SummaryText": "storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia may be stored temporarily in up to 0 rail cars.  The maximum quantity anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in rail cars is 0 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 136,000.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\n            Our worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage \ntank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site empact.  It should be noted that De Kam Seed and Fertilizer has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\n              The most common alternative release scenario (s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted De Kam's Seed and Fertilizer has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n       \n                The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the MN Dept. of Ag. standards OSHA (29CFR1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as \nall applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations."

The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\n                 Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according \nto the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\n                  All locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered.  The management conducts comprehensive annual audits to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n                   The location has a 'site safety coordinator' as an extension of the EHS group.
