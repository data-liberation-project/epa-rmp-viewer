The maximum quantity anhydrous ammonia that may be stored in rail cars is 0 pounds.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 136,000.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\n            Our worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage \ntank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site empact.  It should be noted that De Kam Seed and Fertilizer has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\n              The most common alternative release scenario (s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.  The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be noted De Kam's Seed and Fertilizer has not had a release of this type from any distribution facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n       \n                The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies with the MN Dept. of Ag. standards OSHA (29CFR1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as \nall applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. "
