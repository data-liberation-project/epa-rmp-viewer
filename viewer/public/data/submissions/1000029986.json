The materials used in these processes places the site with one Program 3 process: Aerosol manufacturing and one Program 1 process: Aerosol Warehousing.  \r\n\r\nThe Program 3 process is the facility's Aerosol manufacturing process.  The manufacturing process produces sun care and foot care aerosol products.  The Program 3 RMP-covered chemicals include dimethyl ether and isobutane, and are used as propellants in these products.  There are two; 30,000 gallon storage tanks for each propellant.  The maximum inventory of dimethyl ether is 360,000 pounds; and the maximum inventory of isobutane is 280,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario under Program 3 is failure of an isobutane storage tank and generation of a vapor cloud explosion.  The alternative scenario is failure of a transfer hose while unloading isobutane from a tank truck into the storage tanks.  The unloading hoses are equipped with excess flow valves and smart disconnects, limiting the release to the volume of material in the hose.\r\n\r\nThe Program 1 process includes a product called FreezeAway, containing a mixture of dimethyl ether (also known as methyl ether or oxybis-methane) and propane in an aerosol container which is packaged in a consumer kit format.  This product is stored in our facility's warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe Aerosol Warehousing process includes:  \r\n1)  warehousing QC retain samples\r\n2)  storage of consumer aerosol products prior to distribution\r\n\r\nThe Program 1 RMP-covered chemicals in the Aerosol Warehousing area include:\r\n1)  flammable mixture of dimethyl ether and propane\r\n2)  dimethyl ether \r\n3)  isobutane\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for Aerosol Warehousing is failure of one 5.3 weight ounces container of Lotrimin Spray Aerosol (HC K22-057E).  This container has 123.1 grams of isobutane.  This event would not affect off-site recep"

      "SummaryText": "tors.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP requirements, the facility has an active process safety management program that encompasses all process safety elements including, employee participation, process safety information, process hazards analysis, standard operating procedures, operator training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permitting, management of change, incident investigation, emergency response planning, and compliance auditing.    \r\n\r\nThe facility complies with OSHA 1910.38 requirements and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, Merck would coordinate with the Cleveland Fire Department, Bradley County EMA, and other agencies as appropriate to respond to the emergency.  The Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and members of the Bradley County Emergency Management Agency visited the site to review the site Emergency Response Plan.  The site, LEPC and EMA have agreed on an appropriate response in the case of an event.\r\n\r\nThe Aerosol manufacturing process was subject to rigorous process safety reviews prior to startup.  A process hazards analysis using the HAZOP technique was conducted and recommendations were generated.  This process incorporates a number of safety features including a deluge system in the propellant storage area, safety interlocks and trips in the process, pressure relief systems, and monitoring systems to alert operators of potential incidents."
