Introduction:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in North\n\nBend, OH purchases anhydrous ammonia and brings\n\nit into the plant by barge line and rail car.\n\nAmmonia is burned over precious metal gauze and\n\nconverted into nitric acid.  Additional ammonia\n\nis reacted with nitric acid to make ammonium\n\nnitrate. The urea is brought in by truck or rail\n\ncar and blended with ammonium nitrate to make a\n\nsolution of urea and ammonium nitrate with 28%\n\ntotal nitrogen.  The facility has storage and\n\nshipping capability for all of its final\n\nproducts.  Sales from this facility are from\n\nnitric acid, anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia,\n\nammonium nitrate, and fertilizer solutions,\n\nwhich are mixtures of ammonium nitrate and urea.\n\n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen North Bend facility\n\nhas an excellent safety record with no deaths or\n\nserious injuries to plant personnel or\n\ncontractors since it was constructed in 1965.\n\nIn addition, the plant has operated without a\n\nlost time accident for over 19 years, and over\n\n1,427,548 man-hours. There have been no RMP\n\nreportable releases of toxic chemicals in the\n\nlast 5 years.\n\n\n\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and\n\nProgram:\n\n\n\nAs part of the management system for Process\n\nSafety Management, a plant wide computer system\n\nis utilized which incorporates maintenance and\n\nprocess safety. Computers located in strategic\n\nlocations are used to access plant\n\nfiles for P&ID drawings, operating procedures,\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) documents, and other\n\npertinent documents.  This system is used to\n\nprovide our employees with the necessary tools and\n\nrecords for process safety requirements.  It plays\n\nan integral part in the safety efforts of this\n\nplant.\n\n\n\nIn addition, plant personnel and full time\n\ncontractor personnel routinely participate in\n\nmonthl"

Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThis facility operates an anhydrous ammonia\n\nstorage tank below capacity to provide vapor\n\nspace to allow for liquid expansion.  The tank\n\nis equipped with multiple levels of safeguards\n\nincluding three safety relief valves and a flare\n\nsystem to prevent tank overpressure.  This\n\nscenario results in offsite consequences.\n\nBy law, the EPA requires the worst case scenario\n\nto be a catastrophic rupture of that tank with a\n\ncompete loss of product over 10 minutes.  EPA\n\nmakes this statement about worst case scenarios:\n\n     \"Because the assumptions required for the\n\n     worst -case analysis are very conservative,\n\n     the results likely will be very\n\n     conservative.  These endpoints are\n\n     concentrations below which it is believed\n\n     nearly all individuals could be exposed for\n\n     one half hour to one hour without any\n\n     serious health effects.

The distance to\n\n     the endpoint estimated under worst-case\n\n     conditions should not be considered a zone\n\n     in which the public would be likely in\n\n     danger; instead, it is intended to provide\n\n     an estimate of the maximum possible area\n\n     that might be affected in the unlikely\n\n     event of catastrophic conditions.\n\n     Distances greater than 10 kilometers (6.25\n\n     miles) are particularly uncertain.
