The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHAE is resubmitting the Facility EPA registration to reflect the equipment changes that have been made at the facility.  All accident prevention elements have been developed and reviewed.\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The covered processes operated at this Facility include:\n\no\tCovered Process 1: Fertilizer Blending (Ammonium Polyphosphate)\n\nThe Facility coordinates delivery of anhydrous ammonia by Cargo Truck and hires a Contactor (A.K.A. Independent Fertilizer Reacting Contractor \u0096 IFRC) to transfer and blend anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid and water to make ammonium polyphosphate (APP) fertilizer.  The APP liquid fertilizer is blended in a Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) that is owned and operated by the Contractor.  The APP liquid fertilizer is not subject to the PSM/RMP rules.\nThe Cargo Truck Owner/Operator is responsible for: transporting anhydrous ammonia to the Facility and staging the Cargo Truck.  The Cargo Truck remains connected to the mode of transportation (i.e. Tractor/Truck) and is considered to be in a status of \u0093incident to transportation\u0094.
