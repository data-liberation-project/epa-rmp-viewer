When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Anchor Warehouse Exeter has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Anchor Warehouse Exeter now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.

The facility is located approximately 0.25 miles east of state highway 65 and 3.5 miles south of state highway 198 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\r\n\r\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in an area with 0.2% annual chance of flood.\r\n\r\nAnchor Warehouse Services is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site.

The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condenser and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. High Pressure Receiver 1 is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlooded Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the flooded air-cooling evaporators in the cold storage rooms is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from a flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has e"

Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Direct Expansion)\r\nThe purpose of the direct expansion air-cooling evaporators in the hallway is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the high pressure receivers. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem back to the high pressure receivers. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condenser\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condenser is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.2.5 Safety Systems\r\n\r\nAmmonia Detection System\r\nThere are seven ammonia sensors instal"
