The procedures of the Risk Management Program's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management such as operating and maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. In addition, CCMWA has proactively installed a chlorine scrubber to minimize the consequences of chlorine in the event of an accidental release.\nThis policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to help implement an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Quarles WTP. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services. \nThe Quarles WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers. The Quarles WTP facility has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, the Quarles WTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n3.0  General Facility and Regulated Substance Information\nThe Quarles WTP facility, operating since 1953, is located in Cobb County, Georgia. The primary activity at the Quarles WTP is municipal water treatment, including chlorination of water for disinfection. The Quarles WTP underwent a capacity expansion from 64 to 86 MGD. The sludge lime by-product from the facility is applied to farm land.\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in one-ton steel storage containers. This amount of chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP Rule of 2,500 pounds. Some of the chlorine is used to generate chlorine dioxide, which is used as it is generated, and is not present in the process in amounts greater than the threshold quantity of 1,000 pou"

The facility also has additional alarms for process control. These alarms are annunciated at the chlorine central control panel at the Quarles WTP. \nThe cylinder storage area, the chlorinator room, and the chlorine dioxide generator room are enclosed in a building. A chlorine scrubber is located outside the cylinder storage area. In the event of a leak, the chlorine leak detectors sense the leak and send a signal to activate the scrubber. The exhaust fans pull the contaminated air in the chlorine storage room and route it to the scrubber. The scrubber is 98 percent efficient in capturing chlorine and converting it to an inert substance. The chlorine concentration in the scrubber exhaust would be less than NIOSH short-term exposure limit (SEL) of 3 ppm. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at the building along with smoke alarms. \n\n4.0  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe CCMWA\u00bfs Quarles WTP is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule. A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \u00bfWhat-If\u00bf analysis and a Hazard Review Checklist.\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, an emergency chlorine scrubber, and the presence of chlorine detectors and alarms.\nThe Quarles WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n1) Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\n2) Co"

Response activities also have been discussed with the Cobb County Resource Council.\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the CCMWA\u00bfs Quarles WTP has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system. The following recommendation for improving the response to any chlorine leaks was made:\n1)  Provide additional wind socks to help determine the wind direction."

This executive summary summarizes the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies, source description and regulated substances handled, worst-case and alternative release scenarios including mitigation measures, accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps, 5-year accident history, emergency response program, and planned changes to improve safety. \nAdditionally, this risk management plan contains the data elements that will be submitted to EPA, given in Attachment 13-1. These data elements include registration, offsite consequence analysis, 5-year accident history, prevention program, emergency response program, and certification.\n\n2.0  Introduction\nLiquid chlorine containers are stored at the CCMWA's Quarles Water Treatment Plant (Quarles WTP). Chlorine gas drawn from the containers is used to disinfect water in order to provide safe water for consumption or for other uses. This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.\n\n2.1  Policy Statement\nIt is the policy of CCMWA to operate the Quarles WTP safely, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the chlorine storage and chlorination system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment. Safe operation depends upon proper storage of chlorine, proper handling and maintenance of the chlorination system, and the use of inherent safety features in the design of the chlorination system.\n \n2.2  Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Quarles WTP accidental release prevention policy involves an integrated approach"
