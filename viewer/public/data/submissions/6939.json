Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the mill periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Red River Mill maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Red River Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Red River Mill promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Red River Mill management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Red River Mill have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n \nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Red River Mill.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nSpecialized Safety Features\n \nThe Red River Mill has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \nRelease Detection\n \n1. Chlorine detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.

Over the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nThe Red River Mill maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a safety or health hazard if a hazardous substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Red River Mill.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n \nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Red River Mill is coordinated with the Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Red River Mill has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The Red River Mill conducts periodic emergency drills and provides periodic refresher training to mill personnel regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant."

      "SummaryText": "-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe end point for each toxic substance in the ARP regulations is listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  Toxic endpoints are based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  The ERPG-2 represents the maximum airborne concentration below which EPA judged that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to an hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious human health effects or symptoms.  The endpoint for chlorine is listed as 0.0087 milligrams per liter which is equivalent to 3.1 parts per million (ppm).\n\nFor worst-case scenarios, according to the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance document, you need only consider the largest amount in the vessel, regardless of interconnections with pipes and other vessels.  Therefore, the worst-case is a single chlorine cylinder resulting in a total capacity of 2,000 lbs.  Using the lookup tables and equations, the distance to endpoint for the worst-case release of chlorine (2,000 lbs) at the Red River Mill was calculated to be 3.0 miles.  \n\nToxic Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nOne single alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for chlorine as follows.  A 1-inch header line on a 2,000-pound cylinder is sheared off, allowing the chlorine to be released.  An iterative approach was used to determine an average release rate of 9.9 pounds per minute.  The distance to endpoint calculated from the lookup tables and equations is 0.15 miles.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe Red River Mill does not have any flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analyses of worst-case or alternative release scenarios for flammable substances are not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVEN"

      "SummaryText": "TION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Red River Mill.  Because the processes at the mill that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Red River Mill's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Red River Mill strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Central Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings,  Hazard Communication, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Red River Mill actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs. Accident and release prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI)"

      "SummaryText": "1.0 RED RIVER MILL Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\n2645 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Red River Mill has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Willamette Industries, Inc. (Willamette) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nWillamette owns and operates the Red River Mill located in Campti, Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.  The Red River Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill that utilizes the standard Kraft process for the manufacture of unbleached pulp from wood chips and recycled corrugated containers into linerboard.\n\nThe Red River Mill was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Willamette identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  These are the quantities maintained in process vessels and piping at normal operating conditions and does not necessarily represent maximum capacities of the equipment.\n\nThe only listed substance, which is stored above threshold quantity at the Red River Mill, is chlorine, which is classified as toxic.  Propane, a regulated flammable substance is also stored on site.  However, administration controls are in place to limit the propane storage quantity below threshold.  Based on worst-case analysis the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Red River Mill is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Red River Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP Program.\n\nOFF"
