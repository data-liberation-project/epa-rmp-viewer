No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\nRobert Williams\nPlant Manager\nJune 18, 2004\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Seminole Gas Processing plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n\u00bfA commitment to OSHA\u00bfs PSM and HAZWOPER standards, EPA\u00bfs RMP, DOT\u00bfs Pipeline Safety and Texas Railroad Commission Rule 36 regulations which promote and"

The plant processes or stores regulated flammables, such as Methane, Natural Gas Liquids and Propylene.  In addition, the plant produces and contains as by-products of processing, Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved.  The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Seminole Gas Processing Plant conducts ongoing efforts to reduce risk through the Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management. These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, and recommendations from incident investigations, recommendations from compliance audits and review of the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity program information."
