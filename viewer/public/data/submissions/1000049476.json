All employees\r\nare informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances\r\nreceive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely\r\nremove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to\r\nput in place emergency notification and response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.Facility and Regulated Substances\r\nWoodworth, Inc., based in Homer, MI treats metal and metal parts. The regulated substance at this facility,\r\nanhydrous ammonia, is used in a system for heat treating. In order to protect its employees, the public and\r\nthe environment, Woodworth Inc., has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia\r\nreleases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\r\n\r\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\r\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Woodworth facility.\r\n\r\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\r\nThe Woodworth facility has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of\r\nammonia from the ammonia process system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily\r\ndetected. The system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.\r\nFurther, system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system. In\r\ncase of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Police, Fire Department and the\r\nLocal Emergency Planing Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be\r\nmade as required.\r\n\r\n5.Five Year Accident History\r\nDuring the last five years, there have been no report-able releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Res"

All recommendations during the process hazard analysis are designed to improve the safety\r\nperformance of the ammonia process system. Woodworth Inc., expects to evaluate each\r\nrecommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will\r\nreduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
