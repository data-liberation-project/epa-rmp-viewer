      "SummaryText": "The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility, located on the north-eastern shore of Humboldt Bay, California, serves city of Arcata residents and portions of the unincorporated communities of Fieldbrook and Bayside.   The wastewater facility was designed to process an Average Dry Weather Flow of 2.3 MGD and a maximum hydraulic capacity through the primary system of 5.0 MGD.  Wastewater treatment is accomplished through solids removal, primary and secondary  treatment (oxidation ponds/treatment marshes/enhancement marshes).  Secondarily treated wastewater effluent is disinfected using chlorine and dechlorinated using sulfur dioxide prior to discharge to Outfall 001- Humboldt Bay and Outfall 002 - Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Facility has been handling chlorine for over 25 years and has never experienced a release.  On average, there are 15 (1 ton) chlorine containing cylinders on site.  Typically six (6) cylinders are on-line and nine (9) are in storage.  There are also six (6) sulfur dioxide containing cylinders, with two (2) cylinders on-line and four (4) in storage.  Following a chemical demand evaluation, staff determined that due to an annual average chlorine consumption of 1.5 - 2.0 tons per week,  chemical supplier location  (500 miles), delivery delays due to road conditions and effluent disinfection requirements (public health and off-shore commercial shellfish harvesting) the amount of on-site chemical is necessary.     \n\n\n\nDisinfection is accomplished through treated wastewater being inducted with chlorine gas and detained in the chlorine contact basin.  Following detention, sulfur dioxide is inducted into the chlorinated wastewater for dechlorination and the effluent is discharged to Outfall 001 (Humboldt Bay) and Outfall 002 (Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary).\n\n\n\nThe vaccum operated induction units contain sensors that provide notification upon high vaccum, low vaccum and/or power failure status sensors and are connecte"

The on-call operators are within 30 minute response time of the wastewater treatment plant.   As additional backup, there is on-site automatic audible and visual alarms that alerts employees within the Corporation Yard of a gas leak or release and a manually activated audible alarm to instruct employees and visitors to evacuate the premises. All alarms have uninterupted power supplies installed.  Equipment inspections are regularly conducted and recorded by operational staff.\n\n\n\nThe City has identified three scenarios which may constitute a chlorine or sulfur dioxide emergency; (1) major leak/spill, (2) minor leak/spill, and (3) fire and transportation.  In the event of a major leak/spill or fire and transportation situation Arcata Fire Department and Humboldt Bay Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team will respond to the event.  In the event of a minor leak/spill which is not actively leaking and which does not require the use of a leak kit, trained employees may respond.  A minimum of four trained employees must be present prior to entering the area.  Two employees, wearing radios and personal protective equipment (including SCBAs, if needed), will respond to the leak and two employees will stand-by to conduct monitoring and external communications with other emergency responder personnel. \n\n\n\nA windsock and spotlight, visible from a two (2) miles radius, is located atop the primary digester to provide a visible indicator of wind direction and wind intensity.

The Humboldt Bay region typically experiences moderate to cool, wet weather.\n\n\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as a 10 minute  release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  The distance to the endpoint is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  Assuming a release takes place at ground level, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is defined as 3 parts per million.  This airborne concentration is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals may be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individuals ability to take protection action.\n\n        \n\nDue to its sharp odor characteristic, chlorine is noticeable even when the amount in the air is small.  It is usually possible for persons to leave an area before serious harm is suffered.  Inhalation of chlorine causes general restlessness, panic, severe irritation of the throat, and difficulty breathing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Effect                                                                                 Parts Per Million (Chlorine)\n\nDetectable Odor                                                                                3   PPM\n\nNoxiousness                                                                                     5   PPM\n\nThroat Irritation                                                                                15   PPM \n\nCoughing                                                                                         30   PPM\n\nDeath after a few breaths                                                           1000  PPM   \n\n\n\nResults for the worst"

Use of this table indicates that a 10 minute release of a 1 ton chlorine containing cylinder in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air, in an urban setting results in a 3 PPM endpoint in a 0.9 mile radius.  It should be noted that topography, atomospheric conditions and other site specific variables are not taken into consideration in the endpoint result.  Estimated affected population, based upon Arcata GIS data is 1,598 persons.\n\n\n\nAlthough limited by similar restrictions (topography, atmospheric conditions), the alternative release scenario results are based upon a 60 minute release from a vessel leak releasing 15 pounds chlorine per minute.  EPA's 'RMP*Comp' distance to endpoint result 0.1 miles.  There are no residential structures within the wastewater treatment plants' proximity for 0.5 miles.  Estimated affected population is 0.\n\n\n\nIn 1995 staff investigated and evaluated disinfection alternatives to chlorination/dechlorination.  Methods evaluated included ultraviolet (UV) disinfection, ozonation and sodium hypchlorite.  Due to wastewater effluent characteristics, NPDES permit requirements and financial costs for system design, modification and operations, disinfection utilizing chlorine was deemed the most viable.  In 2009, the Arcata Marsh Research Institue began investigation of UV as an alternate disinfection method.  In 2012, the NPDES permit issued to the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant included requirements to implement UV-disinfection as the primary disinfection process by December 2016.  To-date, the City is in the planning stages for wastewater treatment plant upgrades, including UV-disinfection as the primary disinfection process.  To-date, it is undecided if some level and type of chemical disinfection will remain as a back-up disinfection process.\n\n\n\nThe City's Injury Illness and Prevention Plan (IIPP) was adopted in May of 1996, in accordance with the Cal"
