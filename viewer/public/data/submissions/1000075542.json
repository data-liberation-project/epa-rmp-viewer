The Plant Engineer for the BC Systems BC Salinas site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has established emergency procedures for ammonia releases. The BC Systems BC Salinas emergency personnel will coordinate with the local Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, which include response to emergencies related to the ammonia refrigeration system covered by this CalARP/PSM Program. The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe BC Systems facility covered by this RMP is to be located at 1341 Merrill Street in Salinas, California. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site. The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. Three portable units use ammonia refrigeration in the product cooling process. The Cooler system uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain product at various temperatures. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under CalARP's Title 19 Chapter 4.5 Article 8 Section 2770.5.\n\n \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at BC Systems is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications prior to their occurrence, and the regular operation, maintenance and monitoring of the system. This includes:\n\n?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction of the system, as well as in the "
