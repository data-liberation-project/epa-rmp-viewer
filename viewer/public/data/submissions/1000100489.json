The previous owner/operators listed in descending order are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tRegency Gas Partners\r\n2.\tEagle Rock Energy\r\n3.\tOneok Westex Transmission\r\n4.\tKinder Morgan\r\n5.\tKN Energy  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Gray County Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer operates the Gray County Gas Plant located in Gray County County, Texas. The Gray County Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid Y-grade product from a gas stream. The cryogenic extraction plant recovers methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane from the inlet gas.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Gray County Plant is a Program 1 process.\r\n\r\nThe Gray County Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that a single vessel of flammable mixture exceeded threshold quan"

This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Gray County Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Gray County Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP method to perform these evaluations. This technique provides a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design. Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Gray County Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely"

The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Gray County Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current. When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Gray County Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shut down operations, and safe work practices.
