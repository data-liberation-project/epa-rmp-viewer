To the greatest degree possible, the Winterset Water Utility will provide all\nmechanical and\n  physical facilities required for personal safety and health in keeping with the highest standards.\n  \n  The Water Utility Board of Directors, Supervisory personnel, and employees has committed\nthemselves to\n  safety in all areas of operation with training and policies designed to protect everyone. These\nprograms\n  include, but are not limited to Hazardous Communication (Right-to-Know), Lock-out/Tag-out,\nConfined\n  Space, Respiratory Protection, PPE and Emergency/Disaster Planning.\n  \n  \n  The Winterset Water Utility (WWU) is engaged in the production of potable (drinking) water\nfor the\n  community of Winterset, Iowa.  The treatment plant is located approximately 1.75 miles NE of\nthe community.\n  \n  Its six man staff operates a superpulsator surface water treatment plant under the guidelines of\nthe Iowa\n  Department of Natural Resources. The process treatment flow is as follows:\n  \n  Oxidation using Potassium Permanganate & Chlorine Dioxide utilizing a baffled mixing,\ndetention tank.\n  \n  Flocculation and sedimentation using PAC and polymers for floc formation utilizing both rapid\nand slow\n  mixers and two superpulsator up flow clarifiers.\n  \n  Filtration using a dual bed sand and carbon filter. The GAC helps with removal of inorganics,\nfarm chemicals,\n  taste & odor precursors.\n  \n  Following filtration sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) is added to adjust the pH to control\ncorrosion in the\n  distribution system, hydrofluosilic acid (fluoride) is add"
