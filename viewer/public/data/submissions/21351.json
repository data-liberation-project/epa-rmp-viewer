The diversity of products produced range from EPDM rubber, rubber additive products such as those to keep rubber flexible or aid in its vulcanization, anti-oxidants, to agricultural products.  Recognizing the growing public concern with chemical exposure, Uniroyal Chemical - Geismar \"signed on\" to the Ascension Parish CAER ( Community Awareness and Emergency Response ) program in 1985.  This organization is part of an on-going effort to maintain communications between industry and the general public with the appropriate law enforcement, emergency response personnel, and environmental agencies. This program integrates well with the existing Geismar Plant Emergency Response Procedures which are contained in the Geismar Policy Manual and include:\n     Disaster Notification,\n     Release Reporting Procedures,\n     Emergency Planning and Response,\n     Emergency Assistance and Notification for Serious Injury,\n     Gas Release Procedure,\n     Hurricane Preparedness,\n     Geismar Mutual Aid,\n     Plant Fire Brigade,\n     Hazwoper Safety and Health Plan, and\n     Unusual Incident Reporting\n\nThe requirements in the new RMP regulation to prevent accidental releases are being met at the Geismar facility by established programs which include:\n     Operator training and certification,\n     Work Permits,\n     Hazard Communications,\n     Management of Change for Process and Equipment,\n     Process Hazard Analysis,\n     Reports of Unsafe Conditions,\n     Safety Orientations,\n     Emergency response training,\n     Routinely updated operating procedures,\n     Computers and computerized control systems,\n     Emergency control / shutdown devices / interlocks,\n     Equipment / piping safety controls,\n     Warning alarms,\n     Regular safety checks, and\n     Equipment inspections.\n     \n    The company corporate position has been a"

As part of this continuing improvement, the Geismar Plant is embarking on a program to become registered to the ISO 14001 international environmental standard.\n\n\n\nRMP REPORTABLE CHEMICALS\n\nOf the 140 RMP chemicals, the Geismar Facility handles threshhold quantities of 9 of these chemicals (7 toxic and 2 flammable) with 15 covered processes identified.  Whenever possible, chemicals are handled by pipeline to reduce the impact in the event of a leak rather than stock-piling large amounts in storage tanks.  This is especially true in the handling of the \"worst case\" toxic chemical, chlorine, where a pipeline is preferably used over bulk storage with a 90-ton rail car.  This exposure is only allowed for a few days every 3 to 5 years when the pipeline must be taken out of service for maintenance and/or inspection.\n\nThe first 14 identified processes are Program 3 PSM processes which deal with raw material receiving, storage and handling and as such are controlled by all of the above mentioned \"prevention\" and \"emergency response\" programs.

The distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.1 mile.\nMitigation and Control measures - The tank is provided with level control and alarms to alert to high and low level conditions.  The tank is also contained within a dike.  The level is also inspected and logged daily with checks once per shift.\n\nProcess #12 :  1,1-Dimethylhydrazine\n     The unloading hose fails releasing 650 pounds per minute for 0.5 minutes before the emergency valve can be closed.  The distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.7 miles.\nMitigation and Control measures - The tank truck is unloaded on a diked pad capable of containing the entire truck contents.  An unloading technician monitors the truck during the unloading operation and the truck is equipped with a quick-closing internal valve.\n\n\n\"WORST CASE\" Flammable Release\n\nProcess #13 :  2-Methylpropene\n     Release of the maximum 240,000 pounds from the storage tank within 10 minutes to produce a vapor cloud explosion which generates a 1 psi pressure endpoint at a distance of 0.5 miles.\nMitigation and Control measures - No passive mitigation considered.  The storage tank is provided with its own containment dike, deluge protection and hydrocarbon detection.  The tank level is inspected and logged routinely.\n\n\n\"ALTERNATE CASE\" Flammable Release\n\nProcess #15 :  Propylene\n     The maximum possible capacity of 140,000 pounds of propylene refrigerant is released from the refrigeration unit in 10 minutes and produces a vapor cloud which generates a 3% yield vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to a 1 psi overpressure would be 0.2 miles.\nMitigation and Control measures - No passive mitigation considered.  The refrigeration unit is equipped with a deluge system and hydrocarbon detector.  Operating conditions and levels are monitored and recorded routinely during the day."
