We have never had an accidental release in our 50 years of existence, yet feel confident that we can improve our process to mitigate against the possibility of an accidental release.  In coordination with the repackagers (manufacturers) of these chemicals and our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) our policy is laid forth as follows.  \r\n\r\nOur policy is to reject cylinders that are not in keeping with the D.O.T. regulations regarding proper containment in cylinders.  Any cylinder deemed unacceptable will be refused at the time of shipment and returned to the source by the source's shipper (generally company owned trucks).  Once the product is taken into our possession, we will store these products as far from environmental receptors as possible and practical in order to mitigate against harm caused by an accidental release.  We will also store these products away from our warehouse and with sufficient distance between cylinders or cylinder racks to prevent a"

The products are stored in such a way that accidental movement of the cylinders is not possible, and non-ton cylinders are stored so that liquid release is virtually impossible barring a catastrophic release.  \r\n\r\nAccess to the cylinders by individuals who are not authorized is limited by our safety program which requires anyone who enters our facility to have a badge indicating that they are authorized to be at the facility for a specific purpose.  Anyone who does not have this authority will be immediately scrutinized and removed from the facility if he/she has no good cause to be present.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, our employees will identify the product initially by smell at the greatest safe distance and then contact our Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC) (Lee Earnhardt , President) for further assistance.  At that time the ERC will contact the members of the local emergency response authorities to coordinate action for response to the situation.  In our discussions with the local emergency response authorities, they plan on establishing a perimeter in the case of an accidental release, and then coordinating with our ERC to establish the next best course of action.  We are agreed that we will take advantage of common equipment to deal with an accidental release of any of these gases.  Barber's Chemicals is in possession of cylinder emergency kits A and  B for response to leaks in cylinders.  We will take advantage of OUR OWN SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APARATUS and the local department's self-contained breathing apparatus if necessary to seal the leak in an effective manner.  Once the cylinder has been rendered harmless, the repackager will be contacted for immediate removal of the cylinder from our site so that it can be dealt with immediately at the repackager's facility.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a catastrophic release where the entire contents of a ton cylinder is lost in a ten minute period as indic"

      "SummaryText": "ated by the worst case scenario, our best hope would be immediate evacuation through contact with the local emergency response authority followed by appropriate cleanup of the site after the evacuation of the contents from the cylinder.  \r\n\r\nIn the case of a fire, or temperatures above 165 degrees F for chlorine , the cylinders are designed to release their contents via the melting of a fusible plug which prevents catastrophic releases due to overpressure within the cylinders.  In this case, after the local emergency response authorities have been contacted, it will be established whether it is possible to remove the affected cylinder from the area that caused the release, and then affect the emergency procedure upon the cylinder once it has cooled, or is cooled by external means (if available) to stop the leak.  The alternative release scenarios reflect the type of leak that might be expected if the fusible plug was faulty, or if it had melted.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier in this dialog, we are moving cylinders as far as possible from the environmental receptors to mitigate against contact.  We are considering the possibility of an earth bunker below grade in which to store the chlorine ton cylinders.  This would provide a holding area in the case of an accidental release which would limit the effect of the chlorine release and contain it to some degree.  The down side to this scenario is that in the case of a less than catastrophic release, the danger to the individual attempting to repair the cylinder would be increased dramatically.  The heavy chlorine gas would be concentrated in the bunker, and the access to repair the hole would be limited.  The availability of oxygen would be negligible, and may present a greater risk TO SAFETY rather than being a mitigating factor.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we are pleased with our safety record but look forward to coordinating completely with all of the regulatory agencies as well as demonstrating a willingness to share information with t"
