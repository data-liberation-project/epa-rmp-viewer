Such enforcement involves not only the contractor's responsibilities, but also Williams Refining's obligations under paragraph (h) of the PSM standard.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nWilliams Refining conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) any time new equipment or modifications to existing equipment change the process safety information pertaining to that equipment. The review is intended to verify and document that all aspects of the equipment's design, construction and operation have been evaluated, and to certify that the equipment can safely be placed in operation. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. The PSSR is the final step in the construction or installation of new or modified equipment before the equipment is placed in service. The review addresses:\n\n* Design and construction\n* Maintenance and inspection\n* Procedures\n* Training\n\nUnder most circumstances, the lead engineer on the project is responsible for arranging and facilitating the PSSR, although any employee involved with the project may conduct the review. Participation in the PSSR depends upon the extent and complexity of the project. For large projects, process units for example, the PSSR team is composed of representatives from all involved departments. For small projects, such as the replacement of noncritical valves or pumps, an individual may conduct and document the review.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n1910.119 (j) requires that employers must take specific measures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment.

The refinery has a thoroughly trained, experienced, safety-motivated workforce that has achieved an outstanding safety record. The refinery is in full compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nWilliams Refining has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the time, money, and effort invested in training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Safety tools include engineering controls, real time process monitoring, level, pressure, and temperature alarms, leak detection systems, and automatic and manual mitigation systems. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and contain the release. \n\nTo comply with the RMP standard we have focused upon the following: \n\n* Maintaining the management system established by PSM\n* Adapting the system to address RMP\n* Performing the hazard assessments\n* Compiling the data elements\n* Communicating with the public concerning RMP issues. \n\nAll of the refinery process units are currently managed under the PSM standard. Therefore these processes are, in effect, being managed as RMP Program Level 3 processes.\n\nRMP threshold quantities of flammable mixtures containing Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) such as propane, butanes, propylene, butylenes, etc. are present on site.

When all requirements have been met and all recommendations have been resolved, the new or modified equipment may be placed in service.\n\nAny employee may initiate the MOC process. Typically, the project or process engineer overseeing the change is responsible for verifying completion of the MOC process. Managers over the Operations, Engineering, Maintenance, and PSM departments must document their approval of the change by signing the MOC form. The Safety and PSM Department has ultimate responsibility for verifying that work has been completed, the appropriate approval has been granted, all process safety information has been updated, and that all required documentation is completed, thus closing out the MOC process.\n\nIncident Investigation and Event Notices\n\n29 CFR 1910.119(m) requires investigation of any incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals in the workplace. The policy of the Memphis Refinery is to promptly and thoroughly investigate PSM incidents, as well as events of a lesser nature.

The refinery general manager, operations manager, or manager of Safety and PSM make the determination as to whether events classify as PSM incidents. Those individuals also establish the makeup of the investigation team, which should involve at least one member from Safety, the involved employee, and someone familiar with the process. A formal report is presented and distributed at the conclusion of the investigation. Each recommendation arising from the investigation will be assigned to a responsible individual, entered into the refinery's recommendation tracking system, and followed until it is resolved.\n\nThe Safety and PSM Department holds primary responsibility for administration of the event notice and incident investigation program. The Department ensures that investigations are conducted according to policy and that employees are appropriately involved in the investigation.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nThe Memphis Refinery is required to establish and implement an emergency action plan to handle both large and small releases, to comply with federal law and to fulfill its responsibility to the community. The plan must meet the requirements for employee emergency and fire prevention plans found in 29 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\nThe Memphis Refinery's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) contains specific procedures for prompt response to emergencies that impact property and personnel inside and outside the refinery.

Training required by the plan is conducted by the Safety and PSM Department.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe PSM standard requires that an employer conduct a compliance audit at least every three years to verify that their PSM program meets the regulatory standard. The Memphis Refinery conducts an audit at least once every three years. The self audit is conducted in accordance with the compliance guidelines and enforcement procedures in OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A. The audit team includes at least one employee knowledgeable in the refinery and in the audit process.\n\nAt the conclusion of the audit, the audit team submits a draft report to the refinery general manager for review. Upon acceptance and within 30 days, a final report is released to the general manager. Refinery management will return appropriate responses to each finding in the report, and will take steps necessary to correct any deficiencies detected by the audit.

The confidentiality agreement may also be required of contractors or contract employees, if necessary. The Safety and PSM Department observes this policy in its development and administration of the PSM program.\n\nRecommendation Tracking\n\nPSM requirements for process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and compliance audits direct employers to develop some means of handling deficiencies discovered in the course of those activities. Additionally, there is a need to track MOC completion and pre-startup safety review issues.\n\nThe Memphis Refinery has developed a tracking system to manage recommendations, MOC items, and other safety concerns arising as a result of PSM-related activities. Recommendations are handled similarly, regardless of their source. When a review team member makes a recommendation, it is recorded in the review documentation, and responsibility for evaluation and action is assigned. The recommendation is entered into the appropriate section of the PSM database. The team assigns a target date for resolution.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Williams Refining. Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and/or human error.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Williams Refining has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n* Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n* HF detectors with alarms\n* Hydrogen Sulfide detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n* Emergency shutdown systems\n* Hydrofluoric acid dump tank\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n* Deluge system for Alky Unit\n* Trained emergency response personnel\n* Personal protective equipment \n* Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nPrevention is the best emergency plan.

The refinery participates actively in the LEPC and maintains good relations with the Memphis Fire Dept. The refinery has 24-hour communications ability to notify appropriate emergency response organizations in the event of an emergency. Any public notifications will be coordinated through the Memphis-Shelby County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWilliams Refining is committed to a high level of corporate citizenship, placing the highest priority on the safety of persons both within the refinery, and in the neighboring community. The Memphis Refinery strives to continually improve the safety program, and to reward employees for outstanding safety performance. To further emphasize safety awareness, the refinery has instituted a generous safety bonus incentive program for all refinery employees.\n\nNotes on RMP Information\n\nPossible inventories of RMP flammables in process units were estimated using a conservative technique that yields overstated process inventories. RMP Submit software will not allow value ranges or less than values to be entered.

The Memphis-Shelby County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) was the lead agency in this effort. Williams Refining, 11 other area companies, and numerous federal, state, and local regulatory and emergency response agencies participated in the symposium. Each company or agency prepared a booth with informational literature and displays. Persons ready and willing to discuss RMP, safety programs, or answer public questions staffed the booths. Expert speakers, emergency response equipment, and live demonstrations of Shelter-in-Place and HAZMAT response were also featured. We estimate that 600 people attended the symposium.\n\nThe refinery has been working with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP) to identify effective means for communicating RMP/safety information to our immediate neighboring community. CAP members have provided many helpful suggestions, and have offered to distribute our RMP-related printed materials at various venues in the community. Williams Refining and the CAP members agree that RMP/safety communication should be an ongoing effort.\n\nHazard Assessment Results - Identification of Scenarios\n\nThe toxic and flammable worst case scenarios for the refinery were relatively easy to identify. Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is the only covered toxic that is present in a threshold quantity. All HF in the refinery is in the Alkylation Unit. The largest inventory of RMP flammables is, by far, in the LPG spheres.\n\nHydrofluoric Acid Release Scenarios and Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe EPA-defined toxic worst case scenario (WCS) at the refinery is a catastrophic loss of containment of the largest possible inventory of HF. All of our prevention and mitigation systems must be assumed to fail in this scenario. Weather conditions for the release must be assumed to be adverse to dissipation of the HF by wind, rain, or other action. The WCS for HF involves the simultaneous release of"

Such a release would create a vapor cloud that would travel in the direction of the wind. As the cloud traveled away from the site, it would become less concentrated and less harmful. The estimated maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this WCS is 16 miles. Although we have numerous systems to prevent such releases and to mitigate their consequences, no credit for prevention or mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. \n\nThe ARS for HF is a gasket leak under pressure that goes undiscovered for two hours. In that time about 5760 lbs. of hydrofluoric acid could escape. Upon discovery of the leak, a water stream would be used to remove acid vapors from the air. Although the release would spread in much the same way as in the worst case scenario, the quantity of the chemical released is much less. The estimated maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm (0.016 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 0.31 miles (1640 ft.), assuming that there was no breeze to quickly dilute the release. It is very unlikely that the release described above could go undetected for two hours. However, EPA requires that the alternative case release scenario (ARS) reach an offsite endpoint. \n\nFlammable Release Scenarios and Off Site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe flammable WCS at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the two largest LPG storage tanks, containing Butanes/Butylenes (B/B) Mix. Because of the proximity of the two tanks, we reasoned that a catastrophic VCE from either of the tanks might cause a catastrophic failure of the other tank. Therefore, the WCS is estimated using the full inventory of both tanks combined. B/B Mix was chosen as the worst case flammable because this mixture has the greatest explosive energy of the LPG mixtures stored on site. Other LPG mixtures con"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases, no credit for prevention measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe flammable ARS at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a 10-minute venting of B/B Mix through the 4-inch pressure relief valve atop the storage sphere. This pressure relief valve is set at 280 psi. In 10 minutes about 430,000 lbs. of B/B Mix could escape.
