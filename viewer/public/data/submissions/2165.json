      "SummaryText": "The BOC Gases Weirton facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at 909 4th Street, Weirton, WV. The management and employees of the Weirton facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of hydrogen.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage of liquid hydrogen and transmission of  gaseous hydrogen to Weirton Steel for their use.  Liquid Hydrogen is received and stored in a 20,000 gallon tank at very cold temperatures (-420 F).  The hydrogen is then sent to a vaporizer where the liquid hydrogen is changed into a gas and then delivered to Weirton Steel for their use. \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release, would be the rupture of the 20,000 gallon Liquid Hydrogen Tank. The results would be a maximum release of 11,800 lbs of  hydrogen over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of  1 psi overpressurization from a Vapor Cloud Explosion was determined to be 0.245 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 175 residents and several special receptors; St Peters AME Church and a Day Care center, based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".  One industry ( Weirton  Steel) is also within the endpoint.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the rupturing of the  fill hose during filling of the tank from a road trailer. This release would result in the 10 second release of  55 lb. of liquid hydrogen prior to the activation o"

(1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include one resident with 4 individuals but no several public receptors. One business, Werirton Steel is also affected. \n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, and Emergency Shut-off Valves on the Delivery vehicle and tank,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, and safeties.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on November 5, 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA's hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.  Hands-on training is provided to employees to enhance their senses beyond listening.  In addition, employees receive traditional classroom instruction including lectures, videos, programmed and on-the-job instruction.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate.

In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in November 1998.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.
