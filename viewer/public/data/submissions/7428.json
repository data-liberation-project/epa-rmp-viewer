Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facilitys workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facilitys policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of Texas rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility  provides chlorination services to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from one ton containers to 20 pound capacity service cylinders.  The 20 pound service cylinders are used by the River Oaks Chemicals staff to service customer swimming pools.  The chlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Chlorine is repackaged as a liquid from the one ton containers to the twenty pound cylinders.  Any residual chlorine in the small diameter and short length piping of the repackaging system is directed to a liquid scrubber.  Filling is done by trained and qualified personnel during daylight hours.  Filling procedures are strictly followed.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a one ton container of chlorine.  Failure of this container will release 2,000 lb of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire 2,000 lb is released as gas in ten minutes.  The assumption is made that the gas release from the one ton container is directly to the surrounding atmosphere external to the building.  The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Worst Case scenario  will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenar"

      "SummaryText": "io\n\nThe largest storage vessel is a one ton container of chlorine.  The Alternative Release scenario for the one ton container is a small leak in the packing material around the valve stem of the vapor phase valve located on the one ton container.  There are no active or passive mitigation measures that would reduce the amount of chlorine released or treatment system to which the released chlorine would be directed.  It is assumed that the release would continue for a period odf sixty minutes.  During that time, a total of 442.2 pounds of chlorine would be released.  The distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm for the Alternative Release scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components. \n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention           Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facilitys main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere was an accide"

There was no persons injured onsite or offsite due to the release.  There was no property damage onsite or offsite due to the release.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The County of San Joaquin - Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the State of Californias Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are being reviewed to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the chlorine system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAAG2197.DBC-W50"
