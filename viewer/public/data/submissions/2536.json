It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is used for water and wastewater treatment and as a disenfectant of drinking water.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for  dechlorination of water and wastewater treatment processes.                                    .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements 690000.00 lb. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is expected to be present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 238750.00 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine repackaging.  In this scenario 180000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to f"

The released quantity has been limited to  26% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Chlorine repackaging.  The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario having the effect of limiting the release.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinkler system(s) and Emergency Kits A B.  These active mitigation systems have the effect of controlling the release by use of mechanical methods which have the effect of stopping the leak.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.21 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Sulfur Dioxide, Pkg..  The scenario involves the release of 50 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.21 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
