Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution facility.  We store Anhydrous Ammonia nurse tanks in the off season.  We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of the products in storage at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the tanks combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Honey Creek Township Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and, has instructed employees on procedures for notification of the local authority (Honey Creek Township Fire Department) and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in portable (nurse) tanks.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, an"

The maximum quantity handled, including the nurse tanks, would be 388495 pounds.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis storage facility complies with EPAA\u00c2\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111; A\u00c2\u00bfStorage and Handling Anhydrous AmmoniaA\u00c2\u00bf; periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemist Office are also conducted.  Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our safety coordinator, contractor and insurance companies, and industry experts; an annual formal refresher course (required by Indiana Law) as well as periodic training is also provided.\n\nThe major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, over pressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado.  Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, and excess flow devices are used to minimize the potential for release.\n\nMitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would A\u00c2\u00bfknock downA\u00c2\u00bf the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia.  In addition, passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 85% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n\nEmployees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis.  Employee training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs.  Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n\nMaintenance programs are in place.  Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are re"
