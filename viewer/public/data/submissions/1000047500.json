      "SummaryText": "The City of Gainesville Water Works is located at 2120 Riverside Drive in Gainesville, Georgia.  The Water Works utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water from Lake Lanier to provide drinking water to the City of Gainesville area.  The plant is subject to the RMP regulations since it has greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine on site.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine will be eighteen 1-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe Water Works provides a vital service to the local community.  The use of chlorine to treat drinking water is a universally accepted process. The City of Gainesville recognizes the hazards associated with utilizing chlorine and has rigorous controls in place to avoid releases.  The Water Works developed a RMP Program Manual that summarizes their unified approach to RMP compliance.  The RMP Program integrates technology, procedures, and management practices to proactively manage the potential risks associated with chlorine storage and use.  The program seeks to provide for employee safety, public safety, and response agency interaction.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule has three different levels of compliance (Programs 1-3).  The required levels depend on a combination of the facility's accident history, the presence of off-site public and environmental receptors within the worst-case release scenario radius, OSHA PSM status, and SIC code.  The Water Works is subject to RMP Program Level 2 because they have chlorine on-site in excess of the 2,500 pounds threshold quantity and public receptors within the worst-case release scenario circle.  The Program Level 2 Prevention Program in place at the Water Works is in compliance with the RMP regulations and includes the use of equipment, buildings, and processes designed in accordance with industry codes; formal hazard review procedures; written standard operating procedures; a computerized maintenance system; and, employee training.  Emergency response has been coordinated with the local fire department and Hall County LEPC.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e site also has formal incident investigation procedures and will be performing RMP Program compliance auditing periodically to ensure the Water Works remains in compliance with RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nNo accidents occured during the 5-year accident history portion of the RMP Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe City of Gainesville Water Works will be a defensive responder to accidental releases of chlorine.  A letter was transmitted to the local fire department and Hall County LEPC to ask that the facility be included in the community emergency response plan and inviting the fire department to visit the site to prepare for potential emergencies involving chlorine.  Emergency notification and evacuation procedures are posted at facility telephones and outside the facility gate.  Facility personnel will be provided emergency awareness level training at on-site monthly safety meetings."
