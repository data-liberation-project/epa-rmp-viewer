This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes. It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Todhunter Terminal's RMP regulated activity is the dehydration, storage and distribution of propane   \n\nThere are two (2) regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are propane [CAS# 74-98-6] and ethyl mercaptan [ethanethiol, CAS# 75-08-1].   Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane that is delivered from the facility by truck for safety purposes \n\nPropane is received via pipeline, stored in bullet tanks and redelivered by truck.\n\nA fractionation unit is present on site but is out of service and contains no regulated products.\n\nThe underground caverns are out of service and contain no regulated substances.  When they were in service they were fully regulated under Department of Transportation regulations (49 CFR Part 195) and are therefore exempt from RMP applicability.\n\nBoth compounds are classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68. No compounds classified as toxic are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities. The maximum on-site inventory of propane and mercaptan subject to regulation under 40 CFR Part 68 at any one time is detailed in the RMP submission. \n\nUnregulated jet fuel is also received, stored and delivered from Todhu"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Todhunter Terminal. The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc. \n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs. Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. \n\nOperating Procedures \n\n\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. \n\nTraining \n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Todhunter Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices. In addition, all operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to insure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. \n\nContractors \n\n\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) \n\n\n\nThe Todhunter Terminal conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, person"
