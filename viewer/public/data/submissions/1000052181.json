The portion of the Port facility that is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is operated by INEOS Nitriles, hereafter referred to as Ineos.  The RMP incorporates the release prevention, emergency response, and training provisions of both the owner and operator, since these two entities coordinate implementation of on-site procedures to ensure that both Port and site Ineos employees are properly prepared to prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\n\n\n1.2   Owner History\n\n\n\nThe Port was constructed in the 1950s and designed to accommodate the transfer of chemicals and petrochemicals between ship or barge traffic and pipelines connected directly to remote client facilities.  In 1998, a major expansion of the Port was initiated to accommodate Ineos material transfers and storage.  An additional tank was commissioned in 2004.  The Port owns all equipment used to transfer and store chemicals at the facility, and Ineos is responsible for operation of the equipment to properly manage the chemicals.\n\n\n\n1.3   Operator History\n\n\n\nThe process used to produce Ineos products contain quantities of listed hazardous chemicals that require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the RMP.  Ineos has an outstanding environmental record and is an OSHA VPP Star site, is ISO 14000 certified, and is a participant of the Clean Texas 2000 initiative.  The facility has received the following awards:\n\n\n\n* \"Best In Texas\" from the Texas Chemical Council for the years `89, `91, `92, `95, `96, `97, `98, `99, `00, '02, `03, '04, '05, '06 and '07;\n\n\n\n* NPRA Gold Award  & Award for Achievement - `95, `97 and `98;\n\n\n\n* Governor's Award fo"

The model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used with default weather conditions for worst case and neutral conditions.  ArcGIS was utilized to determine the presence of potential public and environmental receptors within distance to endpoints.\n\n\n\n2.0   Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n2.1   Responsibility\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP is the responsibility of the Port Director.  The Port Director works in cooperation with the Ineos Plant Manager who is in direct consultation with the PSM/RMP Coordinator.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator provides technical expertise for process safety, communicates requirements to appropriate manufacturing managers, and coordinates policies and procedures to meet process safety requirements in support of the manufacturing areas.  Because the day-to-day operations at the Port facility associated with Ineos are the responsibility of Ineos, the PSM program has been developed by Ineos, along with the Process Hazard Analyses, Process Safety Information compilation, Standard Operating Procedures, Inspection and Testing procedures, and other safety-related programs.  Due to the nature of the owner/operator relationship, emergency planning and response procedures and plans have been a collaboration of the Port and Ineos.  Both the Port and Ineos employees who are assigned to Port operations undergo operating and emergency response training specific to the potential hazards related to management of acrylonitrile and ammonia at the Port.\n\n\n\n2.2   Employee Participation\n\n\n\nEmployee participation, as appropriate, in the development of all safety-relat"

It is the policy of the Port and Ineos that all accidents, unsafe conditions and near misses are investigated, and remedial activities identified and implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the condition.\n\n\n\n2.11   Emergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nEmergency procedures have been designed to minimize an employee's exposure to a hazardous chemical release, protect the environment and surrounding community, contain and/or neutralize a spill or release, and have consistent standards applied during a release within the plant boundary.  The emergency procedures for the Port facility are updated and tested on an annual basis to ensure the plan stays current and will accomplish all of the desired results.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the Calhoun County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic mee"

The Port has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., local fire department). \n\n\n\nIneos has a trained Emergency Response Team consisting of approximately 100 employees.  The team trains on a quarterly basis with emergency response drills and scheduled training days.  The facility has trained emergency offsite responders and is a participating member of Chemnet.  This team responds to chemical spills in the plants geographic area, including the Port.\n\n\n\n2.12   Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nPSM/RMP compliance audits are conducted at least every three years to verify that the PSM/RMP procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The compliance audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  Compliance audit reports are prepared.  Responses to the audits are managed, and deficiency corrections are documented.  The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n3.0   Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIn addition to the release prevention program activities, safety features have been designed for all units to:\n\n\n\n* quickly detect a release;\n\n* contain/control a release; and\n\n* reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\n\n\n3.1   Release Detection\n\n\n\nDetectors with alarms are located strategically throughout the process area.\n\n\n\n3.2 Release Containment/Control\n\n\n\nThe containment and control methods utilized to prevent migration to the environment from a release are:\n\n\n\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases;\n\n\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump); and\n\n\n\n* Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\n3.3 Release Mitigation\n\n\n\nThe effects of releases are mitigated by:\n\n\n\n* Use of fire suppression and extinguishing systems;\n\n\n\n* Maintainin"
