The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Somerset Plant uses local emergency responders to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  Plant personnel receive training and conduct drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n7.PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific improvements that we are planning to implement at the Somerset Plant to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n7 A new Corporate program that uses semi-quantitative assessment techniques in process hazard analyses to ensure that controls used for prevention or mitigation of hazards provide ade"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUnion Carbide Corporation has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  The Somerset Latex Plant is committed to operating and maintaining our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Somerset Plant is a manufacturing facility that  produces more than 100 million pounds of water based latex polymer per year.  These products are sold to customers for use in the manufacture of latex paint, water based adhesives and construction products such as caulks and sealants. The facility is recognized as a covered source under the RMP rule as the facility maintains quantities of regulated substances listed in the RMP rule.  The UCAR Emulsion Systems Somerset plant does not maintain specified quantities of any RMP regulated flammable substances, but does utilize the following RMP regulated toxic substances: \n\n7 Acrylonitrile\n7 Vinyl Acetate\n \n 3.Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of"

According to EPA\u0012s Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact the public.  The following administrative control and passive mitigation measure were used in this analysis:\n\n7 Secondary Containment:  The acrylonitrile tank is part of an underground storage tank system.  The tank is enclosed inside a sealed plastic liner, which is completely contained inside a 9300 square foot, 3\u0012 high concrete dike.  Any material released from the tank will remain inside of the containment area until manually pumped out.\n\n7 Mounded Tanks:  As part of the underground storage tank system described above, the acrylonitrile tank is also mounded.  The covered tank minimize leaks and any effects on the surrounding community.\n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and/or to mitigate the effects should they occur, include:\n\n7 Flammable Gas Detectors:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapors within the underground tank storage area.  An alarm will sound when flammable vapors are detected to alert personnel of a possible emergency situation.\n\n7 Deluge System:  A water spray system is designed to help suppress acrylonitrile vapors and wash spilled material to the spill containment basin.\n\n7 Fire Water Monitors:  In addition to the sprinkler-deluge system, area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress acrylonitrile vapors and wash spilled material to the spill containment basin.\n\n7 Vapor Suppression:  Vapor suppressing foam can be applied to the contents of the spill basin described above to reduce the amount of vapors released to the atmosphere.\n\n7 Reaction Prevention:  A system is in place to ensure that the material stored in the acrylonitrile tank is inhibited.
