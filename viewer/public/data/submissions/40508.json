As part of the manufacturing process, an ammonia refrigeration system, containing approximately 34,940 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, is used to provide refrigeration in process areas.\n\nThe facility is currently in the process of updating its PSM Program Standard Operating  procedures with the assistance from Stellar Interactive Solutions an outside consulting firm.  At the time of the filing of this RMP submission, the final update of the PSM program is nearly complete, and we will be sending out refrigeration Technicians to leaner tech in Gainesville GA to School to continue the commitment to safety and to formally provide training to the system operators.  As such, many of the dates listed for performance of our completion of items associated with the PSM program are future dates, by which time the various parts of the program are scheduled to be in place and fully functional.  \n\nIn conjunction with the PSM program, the facility is also working on a revision to its Emergency Response Plan to address the specific issues associated with ammonia refrigeration.\n\nShapiro Packing is committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees, and to being a good neighbor to the community surrounding its facility."
