      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n  Like most dairy manufacturing facilties, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n Garelick Farms is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\n Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes elements addressing: \n\n- EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n- PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed. (NOTE:In review of our process safety information, we suspected that the system's chemical inventory may be understated. As a result of this suspicion, we hire a outside consultant to perform a charge calculation. The result of this study concluded that the declared chemical inventory needed to be elevated. This study was recently performed just prior to this submittal.)\n\n- PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n- OPERATIONG PROCEDURES: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n- MECHANICAL INTERGRITY(Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n- TRAINING: We train our mechanics in safe op"

After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n- COMPLIANCE AUDITS: Every 3 years, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n- TRADE SECRETS: OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets program in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\n- MANAGEMENT SYSTEM: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\nThrough our RMP program, Garelick Farms looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility.\n"
