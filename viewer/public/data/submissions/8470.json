The American Pride Coop Policy\n\nThe management and employees of American Pride Coop, Strasburg facility is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the American Pride Coop has in place a memorandum of understanding with the Strasburg fire department.  This agreement calls for a joint response to and mitigation of any release thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this site is the storage of crop production and crop protection products for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application.  The maximum quantity handled would be 128,602 pounds in one storage vessel {30,000-gallon vessel}.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n7 The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage vessel released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 128,602 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is 1.12 miles.\n \n7 The alternate release scenario is based on the likely potential incident, resulting in a release from a break in a two-inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n \n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe American Pride Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n 5"

      "SummaryText": ".  The Five -Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at Strasburg facility.  Furthermore, to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe American Pride Coop, Strasburg facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.38.}  The American Pride Coop has provided to the Colorado Emergency Planning Commission and the Adams County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The American Pride Coop has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Strasburg Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the American Pride Coop has trained our employees in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
