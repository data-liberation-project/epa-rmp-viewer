The Facility Policy     \n           The owners, management, and employees of Lone Maple Agricultural Services are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of Anhydros Ammonia at our plant.  If an accident should occur, the \nfacility and employees are fully prepared to work with the local fire companies and/or emergency management\nand other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to the people and envi-\nroment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n           The primary activity at Lone Maple Agricultural Services is the storage and blending of fertilizers for\nsale to farmers.\n           Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending\nof mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n           The maximum quantity stored would be 78,030 pounds in our 18,000 gallon  above ground storage tank. \nThe maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n            A.  Our Worst-Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank\n(or truck) as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents\nthe volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the \nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.63 miles.\n\n            B.  Our Alternative Release Scenario is based on the five year accident history or the most likely\npotential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of \ndispersion to 200 PPM) is .60 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n            Our facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \nAnhydrous Ammonia, K"

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910, 111, \"Storage and Handling\nof Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n            Our facility has had no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have\ncaused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor, to our knowledge have resulted\nin offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damages or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n            Our facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38.\n            We provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know informa-\ntion as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n            We have a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910,\n120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n           Safety improvement is an on-going process at Lone Maple Ag.  Periodic evaluations are performed to\nassess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommen-\ndations that we plan on implementing at this time."
