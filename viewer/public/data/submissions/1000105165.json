Once qualified, each team member is expected to respond to emergency alarms while at work or if called out after their normal work shift. \n\nThe program consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including a small incidental emergency, a zone or complex-wide emergency, an external emergency, a hurricane or severe weather emergency, and a bomb threat. The Incident Command System (ICS) is utilized to manage all emergency response situations. The Pasadena Plastics Complex Emergency Response Team, a volunteer group of trained employees, responds to all plant emergencies to help minimize loss of like, property and to provide emergency medical care to the injured. Trained Emergency Responders are onsite 24 hours per day. \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is divided into five zones; all other areas are considered Outside Zones. The zones are further divided into Affected Zones and Un-affected Zones depending upon the location and nature of the incident. The Emergency Alarm System is designed to make either an Alarm or Announcement Tone followed by a voice message in the event of an incident. The Emergency Alarm System is maintained to help response personnel or personnel working in either the Affected, Un-affected or Outside Zone determine the appropriate actions specified in the Emergency Action Plan.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors. \nIn addition to the Accident Prevention Program activities, Pasadena Plastics Complex has safety features on many of its units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \nRelease Detection: \n- Release detection system connected to a plant-wide Emergency Alarm System. \nRelease Containment/Control: \n- Periodic inspection of process equipment. Inspections by Operators each shift. \n- Routine leak detection and repair program for all system components. \n- Remotely activated valves to isolate and limit release. \n- Emergency equipment shutdown systems that are activated automatically, locally or remotely. \n- Diked and sloped area with sump for spill containment. \n- Relief devices to prevent system overpressure. \n- Automatic overfill prevention instrumentation. \n- Specialized excess flow valves to restrict release. \n- Dual seals on pumps in flammable hydrocarbon service with installed devices to detect potential conditions that could develop into a Loss of Containment. The devices initiate either an alarm or specific shut down action. \n- Process Relief Valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate releases. \n- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated). \n- Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump). \n- Equipment designe"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex conducts a Pre-startup Safety Review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. A PSSR is conducted for the following types of changes: equipment, facilities, and/or process chemicals, technology, and software. The PSSR serves as a final check prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals into the process at a new facility and conducted prior to start-up, commissioning, or engagement of the change, for existing, modified facilities. The PSSR must confirm the following: a PHA has been performed for new facilities and that PHA recommendations have been resolved, MOC requirements have been executed for changes to modified facilities, construction and equipment installation is in accordance with design specifications, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completed, and, safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate. \n\nIncident Investigation \nIncidents, which resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical, are investigated by a cross-section of plant personnel. The composition of investigation teams varies with the complexity of the incident, but the underlying philosophy is one of employee/contractor employee involvement, as appropriate. \n\nPasadena Plastics Complex is a member of the TOP (Triangle of Prevention) Program.

Examples of these include (1) hot work permits to control work involving flame or spark-producing operations, (2) confined space entry permits to ensure adequate safety precautions have been taken prior to entering vessels, tanks and other confined spaces, (3) lockout/tagout procedures to guarantee isolation of energy sources prior to working on equipment, (4) pressure-relief device (PRD) removal procedures to ensure adequate alternate relief paths are available prior to removal of any PRD, and (5) interlock and alarm bypassing procedures to ensure that critical process controls are managed properly. These procedures, along with others, form a system to help make certain that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner. \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) and Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) \nPasadena Plastics Complex has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. Changes may introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards incorporated in the original design of the process and must be reviewed prior to their implementation. This system requires that change to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), software, procedures (including operating, maintenance, and safe work) and emergency procedures be properly reviewed for potential hazards and authorized using the MOC/PSSR certification form and an electronic approval process before being implemented.

This meeting is in addition to the required contractor group safety meetings. \n\nIn 2023, PPC Initiated the Contractor Buddy Program focused on increasing facility leadership engagement with a leader of the contractor\u2019s company for safety influence. Monthly meetings are held to review a scorecard displaying key performance metrics, and discussion of other potential topics. Key metrics include: First Aids/Near Misses/Injuries, Life Saving Rules (LSR) Violations, Safety Observations/Suggestions, Management Walkthrough items, Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) Statistics, and Safety meeting attendance and topics cover. Other topics include how expectations for improvements in safety performance are being met and identify and promote best practices utilized by the Contractor Company.

Operator Training has been developed to equip operators with the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and proficiently perform their job duties. This training emphasizes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks. Written tests, oral tests, observation, demonstration and peer evaluations are utilized to verify the training. \n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible.

The Checklist, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), or other appropriate equivalent methodologies, were used to perform the PHAs on each covered process at Pasadena Plastics Complex. A PHA results in action items (findings/recommendations) that identify and address perceived potential hazards. \nPasadena Plastics Complex additionally uses Layers of Protection Analysis methodology (commonly referred to as LOPA) to integrate process risk management into a unified, comprehensive program and identify Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) in accordance with ANSI/ISA S84.01-1996 and IEC 61511. \n\nIndependent Protection Layers (IPLs) are systems used to mitigate serious environmental and process safety risk, identified during the process hazard analysis. IPLs include specific and identified standard operating procedures, alarms with operator response, safety instrumented systems, emergency shutdown systems, and protective devices. IPLs can be viewed as one of the first line of defense against a potential incident and often decrease the frequency of a potential incident. \n\nIPL Analysis provides the risk assessment methodology for the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) which is an integral part of the PSM program.
