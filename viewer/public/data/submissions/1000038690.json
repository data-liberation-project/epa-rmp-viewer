The facility processes and stores fluid milk products using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. Ammonia has an excellent safety record, is exceptionally energy efficient and, unlike some refrigerants, is not harmful to the earths ozone layer and does not contribute to global warming or air pollution.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\nDarigold is required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program at the Boise facility basically because the\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management standard is also\r\napplicable to the site. The Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Program 3 Prevention Program includes\r\nthe requirements of the OSHA PSM standard which includes elements for employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check valves, and leak detectors.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, in"

There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.38 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, and orderly evacuation of the facility. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to  Improve Safety\r\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order."
