This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nTE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the following documents: Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), and Facility Response Plan (FRP).  Most of the documents listed have a minimum of annual training requirements to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  Employees (in specific job roles) are required to read and be familiar with the contents of the above-listed plans.\n\n\n\nTE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTE is located in Casselton, Cass County North Dakota.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from grain.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is a Flammable Mixture (denaturant or natural gasoline).\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is based on the release of the entire contents of the denaturant aboveground storage tank (150,000 gallons) followed by ignition, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The denaturant tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains a bentonite liner with gravel overlay.  The containment be"

A worst case SDS was used to determine the pounds of the flammable mixture onsite.  Of the entire tank contents, only 285,600 pounds is considered reportable under the RMP program.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint.  The mode results and reportable constituent determination spreadsheet is included as part of RMP documentation onsite.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of denaturant due to a tanker truck accident and spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.  The endpoint used was an overpressurization of 1 PSI - a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a number of facility personnel present onsite.  For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered as most mitigation strategies in place would not contain a  vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate case distance to endpoint.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe TE facility qualifies as a Program 3.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidential release prevention program information.  In addition, the TE facility has implemented an OSHA PSM program at the facility.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nTo date, there has not been a reportable accident onsite involving the covered process.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nTE has several safety programs in"
