The monitoring system highlighted within this project is manufactured by Boreal Laser and is a laser-based monitoring system. One system for each area will be installed. The HF system will monitor high-risk areas such as the North bulk pit, distillation units, and offloading area (Bulk HF Operations). The Ammonia system will monitor high-risk Ammonia areas such as the Ammonium Fluoride reactor room as well as the outside area adjacent to the Ammonia storage tank.\n\nIn addition, plant tours which include the review of the facilities emergency response plan and worst-case scenarios are being performed with the local fire departments and Hazmat teams. Plans are also being made to begin joint onsite emergency drills/training between the City of Mesa Fire Department and Hazmat Teams and FUJIFILM Electronic Materials Emergency Response Team members. Note that these plans were placed on hold due to COVID, but the planning is expected to resume."

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that such management systems set the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  We maintain certification to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System standard and the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System standard which further supports our commitment to our employees, the community and continual improvement of our operations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nInvestigation records are maintained for all incidents that occur at our facility.  We have had zero accidental releases in the last five years that meet the RMP rule reporting criteria.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major spill or release, the goal of the Site Emergency Response Team is to contain any releases and to correct the problem before any off-site impact occurs.  Our emergency response plan (ERP) addresses the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency planning, providing the essential elements for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \n\nTo assist us in the event of an emergency, local area emergency responders have been provided with our ERP.  Facility Response Team members are on site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  These highly trained employees are experienced in Chemical Emergency Response, as well as First Aid.  On site drills and training are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe City of Mesa Fire Department is responsible for notifying the public of a"

There are no RMP-regulated flammable chemicals handled or stored at/above threshold quantities at the Mesa facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  To minimize the chance of a release with offsite implications, the Mesa facility has six layers of safety and environmental protection; our employees, mechanical integrity programs, hazard reviews, process controls, monitoring systems and emergency response.  \n\nEmployees: Well-trained employees with accurate operating procedures and strong management and engineering support are our most important resource in operating our facilities and in protecting the community.  \nMechanical Integrity: This comprehensive inspection and testing program for operating equipment provides more reliable and well-maintained equipment, which greatly reduces the probability of failure.\nHazard Reviews:  Reviews are conducted on all processes within the facility handling hazardous materials. Hazard Reviews identify things that could possibly go wrong so that these situations can be corrected and controlled before an incident occurs.\nProcess Controls:  The Mesa Facility has a variety of back-up systems which provide precise control of processes and maintain tight operating parameters.\nMonitoring Systems:  Product sensing detectors immediately identify any potential problems, giving operators an early warning w"
