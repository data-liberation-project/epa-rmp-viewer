If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Mt Victory facility is located just south of the town of Mt Victory and has a dry fertilize warehouse in town along the CSX railroad.  The facility is a fertilize, bagged feed, and seed facility.  The anhydrous  is trucked in only and used as an agriculture crop nutrient.  Mt Victory has a 18,000 gal storage tank that would have a maximum allowable storage of 79,600 lbs.  The maximum amount handled during the semi off-loading would be 42,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario at Mt Victory would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum released would be 79,600 lbs, which would be 85% of the volume of the storage tank the design capacity amount.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 20ppm) is .83 miles.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario based on our five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm)is .59 miles.\n\n5.  The Mt Victory facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", and the OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.111.\n\n6.  There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n7.  Mt Victory has a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.  They have also provided local fire and LEPC with right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n8.  Our company policy is to rem"
