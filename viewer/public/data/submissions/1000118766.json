This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The Maumee facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Andersons Maumee Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies. The facility manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  The only RMP-regulated material stored at the Maumee Complex is anhydrous ammonia at the Wholesale Fertilizer facility. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Andersons has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Andersons  maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures\nTo ensure safe operations, The Andersons maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The informatio"

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Andersons believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit\nThe Andersons has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nContractors\nThis facility uses a certified contractor for all welding and construction performed on the anhydrous ammonia tank or transfer pipes.  Copies of all reports are on file. The Maumee processing plant undergoes a complete ammonia inspection by a third party at least every five years.\n\nTraining\nAll employees receive annual training on anhydrous ammonia, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication.

During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules and the ability to request an MSDS for any product at any time.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been made at the Maumee facility, as part of their Process Safety Management Program.  The analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made.  PHA's are performed using the HAZOP technique and analyze all aspects involved in the production of the fertilizer.  The evaluation team includes representatives from the corporate Safety Department, group Management and Operations employees.\n\nEach situation is discussed and possible causes are listed.  Unless otherwise noted, situations are evaluated under the assumption that safety controls are in effect.  Potential consequences are listed and given a rating of 1 to 4 for severity and likelihood; with 1 being the worst case and 4 being none or very low.  When plotted, a risk value is assigned from A to D; again with A being the highest priority and most critical item and D being of least consequence with no mandatory follow up.  Finally, the recommendations and follow up are assigned to personnel and after completion the results are documented.\n\nIncident Investigations\nFormal investigations are performed for all environmental or safety incidents.  Documentation is kept on file at the facility and the corporate Safety Department.\n\nManagement of Change and PSSR\nA formal Management of Change (MOC) and Pre Startup Safety Review (PSSR) system is administered by the Safety Department.  An MOC/PSSR form is filled out whenever a change is planned to the production system and finalized before startup.  Forms are routed from the facility operator to the Engineering and Safety personnel for review and remarks.  All forms are kept and routed"

Operators and management, together with representatives from the Safety and Engineering Departments spend the day discussing any and all issues related to the production of 10-34-0 and aqua ammonia.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThe Maumee facility has not had an ammonia release in the last five years.\n\nhe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of a release, employees are instructed to shut down the conversion process and, if possible, approach the shutoff valve from upwind and attempt to turn it off. \n\nFor an uncontainable release, employees will immediately call the police and fire department or other first responders, as appropriate.  All employees, customers and contractors are to be evacuated to an upwind location. Once the response team has arrived, we will work with them to close the valves between the tank and the leak.  In the meantime, a steady spray of water will deluge the ammonia gas plume and knock it to the ground, while chemically binding any free ammonia.\n\nThe employees are instructed to make emergency phone calls in this order:  the Facility Manager, 911, the corporate Safety Department emergency phone number.  The corporate Safety Department will notify the Ohio Emergency Response Hotline hotline and the National Spill Response Center phone number.  All applicable contact names and numbers are found in the facility spill and emergency response plan.\n\nCommunication procedures with responders \nThe local fire department is invited to tour the Maumee facility on an annual basis.

A copy of the Maumee Emergency Action Plan is on file with the LEPC and the local fire departments.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe Andersons is continually working with management and employees to improve safety at the terminal.
