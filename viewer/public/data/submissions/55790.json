If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2.

To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\na. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.

The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos-Methyl (400 pounds); Carbofuran (198 pounds); Dimethoate (6420 pounds); Disulfoton (540 pounds); Endosulfan (1362 pounds); Methamidophos (1440 pounds); Methomyl (2880 pounds); Oxamyl (1512 pounds); Paraquat (5544 pounds); Phorate (1600 pounds) and Phosmet (1890 pounds).\n\nc. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in an 18,060-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 79,058 pounds.\n\nd. Aqua Ammonia (24.4"

Aqua Ammonia is stored in three aboveground storage tanks.  The tank capacities are 24,863 gallons, 24,863 gallons and 158,625 gallons for a total of 208,351 gallons.  The maximum quantity of Aqua Ammonia handled at the facility is 1,583,468 pounds.\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Case Release scenarios\n\nRegulations require the estimation of a worst-case accident and alternative case accident scenarios.  The results of the scenarios are not reported in the Executive Summary per direction from the EPA but are reported in the body of the program\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nCPS Firebaugh has comprehensive written programs and procedures to comply with the CalARP/RMP program regulations.  Key to getting all programs and procedures in place was (1) having the facility management understand what the CalARP/RMP regulations required and (2) developing and implementing specific written programs, written procedures and practices to meet those regulations.\n\nFacility management and employees involved in any of the covered processes have been trained and made aware of the provisions and requirements in the programs and practices.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History \n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia or any of the 11 regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse that have caused any deaths, injuries or property damage at the facility nor resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan.  The local fire department has conducted a facility visit specifically addressing the response to releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and products stored in the Chemical Warehouse.  One employee at the facility is trained as an emergency responder to the 24-Hour HAZWOPER Tec"
