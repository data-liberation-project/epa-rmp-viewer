Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and employees of Crop Production Service, 5018 Santa Fe Grade, Firebaugh, California are committed to the prevention of a release of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agronomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\na. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nb. 11 agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated substances.  The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos-Methyl (400 pounds); Carbofuran (198 pounds); Dimethoate (6420 pounds); Disulfoton (540 pounds); Endosulfan (1362 pounds); Methamidophos (1440 pounds); Methomyl (2880 pounds); Oxamyl (1512 pounds); Paraquat (5544 pounds); Phorate (1600 pounds) and Phosmet (1890 pounds).\n\nc. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to growers for use as a plant nutrient.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck and stored in an 18,060-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at the facility is 79,058 pounds.\n\nd.
