Mechanical compression and heat exchange cycles occur within the interconnected piping and equipment.  The elements of process safety management are implemented to assure the ammonia refrigeration system is operated safely.  A PHA revalidation was conducted on (05/21/2009) in order to identify hazards and address them adequately.  \nPrimary safeguards include ammonia detection and machinery room emergency ventilation.   The PSM/RMP prevention program is managed by facility staff to assure system equipment safeguards and industry standards are met to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Mechanical Integrity of the process equipment is maintained through inspections, routine testing and appropriate levels of operator training.  Refrigeration system operators and contractors receive training for safe work practices to prevent all releases or stop them small in instance when incidental releases might occur. \n\n\nSafety Audits include evaluations and recommendations for updating and improving the program.",

Americold is a company that has grown with a core guiding principle that A?we do whatA?s rightA?.   This principle implies a commitment to provide a safe work environment above and beyond general regulatory requirements.   Reducing the risks and affects of ammonia releases is a primary consideration of the safety programs and planning that goes on during routine operations.  The company employee activities, including safety are subject to key performance indicators.  The organization measures results to constantly improve risk exposure.  The balance of productivity, minimized risk, safety compliance, environmental stewardship and profitability are all part of the measure of success. \n\nProcess safety program elements are built to overlap with employee health and safety training programs.  An employee emergency action and fire prevention plan is in place to provide safe egress and procedures for employees to follow during emergency situations, whether an evacuation or shelter in place.  Refrigeration employees and facility managers undergo at a minimum awareness level first responder training.  An emergency response plan and emergency response personnel are in place at the facility.  Emergency response is provided by Mid County Fire District in the event of an emergency situation requiring outside assistance.\n\n\n\nEfforts to minimize the risk of an accidental ammonia release are achieved by adhering to and exceeding compliance requirements with attention focused on employee training and the integrity of the ammonia process equipment.  PSM is adopted as the culture to manage the ammonia refrigeration system safely to avoid hazardous consequences associated with anhydrous ammonia releases.  Re"

The facility operates the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and provides employee ammonia awareness training experience for everyone working around the warehouse environment.\n\n\n\nFive Year accident History- In the past five years there has been a reportable ammonia release.  On 9/15/05, Americold A? St. Louis sustained a significant ammonia leak during a construction project.  Human error on both Americold personnel and the refrigeration contractor, along with mechanical failure was determined to be root causes. All findings were addressed in Americold A?s PHA and PSM programs to alleviate any future reoccurrences.\n\n\n\nThis facility is subject to EPCRA Tier II reporting requirements and has submitted tier II reports annually in a timely manner.  This reporting provides local public safety officials with facility chemical use and storage, and facility contact information for emergency response.  \n\n\n\nHazmat training is provided for refrigeration personnel and employees with key rolls during emergency situations. This training is enhancing the confidence as Hazmat technicians and Incident command level support can work together with in the public safety sector. Training to this level is in place to support local authorities with ammonia response specialists in an effort to coordinate response plans for the facility.  This training and approach is based on Ammonia Safety and Training Institutes A?One PlanA? for ammonia emergency response.    \n\n"
