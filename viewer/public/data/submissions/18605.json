This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant, located 6.0 miles Southeast of Sonora on FM 1691, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from gas wells.  The Sonora II Gas Plant handles methane; ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables. The Sonora II Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest process vessel which is a 7,000 Gal. LPG Storage Tank which contains an NFPA-4 mixture. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was calculated at 0.2 miles using EPA RMP*Comp computer software.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  No public or environmental receptor were found within the endpoint distance.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidenta"

This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.  This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Sonora II Gas Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Sonora II Gas Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  \n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant primarily uses the Haz Op analysis technique to perform"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. \nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sonora II Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising th"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Sonora II Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Because processes at the Sonora II Gas Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sonora II Gas Plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Sonora II Gas Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, The Sonora II Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

New employees receive initial training in Sonora II Gas Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Sonora II Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Sonora II Gas Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
