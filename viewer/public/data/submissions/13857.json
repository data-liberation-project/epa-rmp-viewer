      "SummaryText": "Johnny Boyd Fertilizer Company, Inc. has operated a fertilizer plant in Statesboro, Georgia for many years. We are are developing a comprehensive emergency response plan and an accident prevention program for our facility in response to the new RMP program.  We will cooperate with public emergency planning agencies to develop and maintain contingency plans in case of an accidental release.   This facility has  remained accident free for more than five years.\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia tank farm is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safe reliable operation.   Safety placards are placed  on the tanks, and at fill stations.   The facility's 12,000 tank and 8000 gallon tank are both  equipped with pressure relief valves and gauges to prevent overpressurization.  The supply lines are equipped with excess flow devices that will automatically shut off the flow in the event of a pipe or transfer hose failure.  The tanks and pipes also feature manual shutoff valves to stop and isolate a leak so that it can be repaired.  The facility has a water purging system to clear any extraneous product from the transfer lines after use.  There is a water supply located at the fill station to rinse away any product in case of accidental skin contact.\n\nThe worst case scenario indicate that businesses and residences offsite will be affected in the event of a catastrophic release.  However we believe that our vigorous safety and emergency response programs greatly reduce the likelihood of this scenario from happening.  The alternative case release scenario is a more accurate assessment of risk to the community."
