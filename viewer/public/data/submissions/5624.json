These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serve as a local sponsor for federal water projects and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA's defined territory that include all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles.\n  \nPublic services currently provided and/or being developed by the Authority include wastewater treatment, water treatment, water supply, flood control, recreation and reservoir facilities.  The Authority also serves as a conduit for tax exempt financing for municipal water and wastewater facilities and industrial air and water pollution control facilities.  Each operation and/or financing endeavor is an independent financial entity.  On a functional basis, the Authority operates as a governmental utility, receives no direct tax revenues or revenue sharing and is compensated for services rendered.\n\nPerhaps our greatest impact to lthe general public is our ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  We provide essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is our duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.   There are other operators of water utilities in these regions who have an interest in the same risk management issues.\n\nTRA's Central Regional Wastewater System (CRWS) was placed in operation in 1959.  This regional treatment facility is one of the largest and best operating plants in the State of Texas.  With the treatment plant located in Grand Prairie and over two hundred miles of pipeline this system has been named one of the best"

In 1993, the treatment facility was expanded to process 135-MGD capacity with total secondary and tertiary treatment and the ability to treat a two-hour peak 335-MGD.  The system has a service area of 450 square miles and provides services to twenty-one Metroplex area cities.  This system uses state of the art technology in collection system telemetering, computer systems, operational control and maintenance management.\n\nAs a result of new federal guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the CRWS is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) due to the amounts of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that it uses in its treatment process.   In developing its RMP, CRWS has conducted an analysis of potential off-site consequences of an accidental release including a \"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five year accidental release history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  This emergency response plan includes practice drills, plans for coordination with local emergency officials and offsite responders, alarm systems, first aid and emergency medical treatment available for treatment of human exposure.   The CRWS has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to covered processes in the past five years.   \n\nWith respect to accident prevention programs:\n* Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\n* Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\n* Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\n* Written operating procedures are continuously updated and mai"
