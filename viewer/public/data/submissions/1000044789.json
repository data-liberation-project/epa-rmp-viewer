The Cedar Rapids Water Pollution Control Facility (CRWPCF) handles, uses, and stores chlorine (an EPA-regulated substance) in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold of 2,500 pounds.  \r\n\r\nCRWPCF is located on approximately 75 acres in the southeastern quadrant of Cedar Rapids and serves the cities of Cedar Rapids, Marion, Hiawatha, Robins, Palo and parts of Linn County.  The plant became operational in 1980 and offers treatment of up to 56 million gallons of wastewater per day (Average Wet Weather AWW).  Advanced biological treatment provides processing of industrial and domestic waste.  Administration, Operations, Maintenance and Warehouse buildings provide the support and control functions for the wastewater treatment and solids handling facilities. \r\n\r\nCRWPCF was constructed to meet the design requirements contained in the Ten States Standards document, Recommended Standards for Wastewater Facilities, and is operated to maintain discharge compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA).  Federal and state requirements under the CWA are defined in a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.  The NPDES Permit allows the City to operate the plant, discharge treated wastewater to the Cedar River, and establishes daily maximum and monthly average effluent limitations for the plant.\r\n\r\nCRWPCF uses chlorine in the final step of the treatment process to disinfect treated wastewater to prevent the spread of pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms prior to its discharge to the Cedar River.  Continuous chlorination and de-chlorination of the wastewater is conducted between March 15 and November 15 as required by the NPDES Permit.  The chemical properties of chlorine"

Chlorine is delivered to the CRWPCF by a commercial supplier in one-ton containers as a liquified gas under pressure.  All of the chlorine is stored, handled, and used in the Disinfection Facility.  The Disinfection Facility includes a Chlorine Storage Room, Lab/Control Room, Electrical/Sample Room, Chlorine Feed Room and Magnesium Bisulfite or MBS (chemical feed system).  Magnesium bisulfite, which is used as a de-chlorinating agent, is stored outside in two liquid storage tanks.  \r\n\r\nOff-loading of the chlorine containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist and then transferred inside the Chlorine Storage Room for safe storage and use.  Administrative procedures are in place to limit the amount of chlorine in one-ton containers at the facility at any one time.  Delivery of the chlorine containers is during normal working hours.  \r\n\r\nCRWPCF has adequate room for parking of the delivery vehicle during off-loading of the full chlorine containers and loading of the empty chlorine containers.  The container storage and handling is conducted according to the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 1, Chlorine Basics.  The entire Water Pollution Control Facility is fenced with controlled access and the Chlorine Storage Room in the Disinfection Building is kept locked.  Only authorized personnel are allowed entry into the Disinfection Facility where chlorine is present.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorine ton-containers are connected to the chlorine system when they are needed as the source of chlorine.  One 'one-ton' container is on-line at any one time with an additional seven ton-containers on standby.  Chlorination of the wastewater is conducted by injecting and dissolving chlorine gas directly into the effluent wastewater.  This process is nec"

The liquid chlorine is withdrawn from the chlorine containers by vacuum, which is created by an eductor.  The vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm, and withdraws liquid from the one-ton container at a controlled feed rate set by the process operators. The chlorine is converted to a gas at the Chlorine Vaporizers and is injected, through chlorinators, which control chlorine flow into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine / water solution and is fed directly into to the wastewater.  \r\nChlorine is removed from the effluent with the addition of magnesium bisulfite to reduce potential impacts on aquatic organisms from the formation of disinfection byproducts.  \r\n\r\nThe Chlorine Storage Room is equipped with an exhaust ventilation system, gas detectors, alarm system and a dry chemical scrubber. The scrubber has capacity to neutralize one full container of chlorine in event of catastrophic failure.  The Disinfection Facility is normally unmanned, but the facility is equipped and monitored via closed-circuit television cameras, operators visit the facility multiple times each day and respond to any alarms as they occur.\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternate release scenario.  The worst-case scenario is defined by the EPA, which states the owner or operator shall assume that the ...maximum quantity in the largest vessel ...is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternate scenario is defined as more likely to occur as the worst-case release scenario.  \r\n\r\nEPA regulations require the use of tables or atmospheric dispersion modeling to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint is the distance a gas/vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the"

The toxic endpoint selected by EPA for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm), the concentration defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  \r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on site in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vessel's contents and usage (40 CFR 68 Section 68.25).  The one-ton container of chlorine is the largest vessel in the treatment system and has 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine.  The worst case release scenario for the one-ton container of chlorine is the release of the 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas at the rate of 200 lbs./minute for 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of the worst case scenario will extend beyond the boundaries of the WPCF (1.3 miles).\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for the one-ton container of chlorine is a leakage rate of 2 lbs. /minute occurring in the packing material around the valve stem of the gas valve on the one-ton container.  There are no active or passive mitigation measures that are considered to reduce the amount of chlorine released or treatment system to which released chlorine would be directed and treated.  It is assumed that the release rate would continue for a period of 60 minutes.  During that time a total of 120 pounds of chlorine would be released.  In this scenario, the distance to the endpoint would not extend beyond the boundaries of the WPCF.\r\n\r\nCRWPCF accidental release prevention program is based on: a high level of training of the operators, a preventive maintenance program that includes an annual operations and maintenance safety review prior to seasonal"

      "SummaryText": "start-up of equipment, the use of process and safety equipment, accurate and effective operating procedures,  a hazard review of equipment and procedures, and implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nIt is CRWPCF policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations relating to the accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals.  Safety depends upon:  the safe procedures used to handle chlorine, the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility, and the training of personnel.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific prevention steps include: the availability of respiratory protection devices, which include a supplied air respirator or a self-contained breathing apparatus worn by mechanics while connecting or disconnecting chlorine ton-containers, awareness training of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors throughout the Disinfection Facility.\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls exist to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from the one-ton container if an accidental release were to occur.  Administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system along with training provided to operators of the process system.\r\n\r\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum if a release were to occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing and maintenance of the chlorine process systems; their related equipment and components.  The chlorination system is a vacuum system, which means that any loss of vacuum would immediately result in the stoppage of chlorine gas flow.  Additionally, each chlorine ton-container is equipped with an automatic valve shutoff device that allows operators to remotely shut-off flow at the chlorine ton-container.  In the event of failures of both mitigation measures, there is a dry scrubber system designe"

      "SummaryText": "d to absorb contents from an entire ton-container.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years that have resulted in injuries, fatalities, loss or damage of property, environmental damage, or involved evacuation or sheltering-in-place.\r\n\r\nNationwide, accidents reported to EPA involving chlorine systems have been caused by rust holes, failure of a diaphragm, leaks during hookup to a tank, a packing nut leak, faulty cylinders, removal of a valve in error, faulty valves, leaking gaskets, and/or a blown pressure gauge.  Each of these incidents, while potentially serious, can be easily controlled through maintenance or process system safety features that would prevent a catastrophic release.  \r\n\r\nCRWPCF Emergency Response Program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacuate the Disinfection Facility and await the arrival of responders from the Cedar Rapids Fire Department (CRFD) Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team at the evacuation assembly location if a chlorine release occurs.  The emergency response program has been coordinated with the CRFD HAZMAT.  The CRFD has a professional, well-trained and well-equipped HAZMAT.   CRFD is a member of the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \r\n\r\nThe CRFD HAZMAT Response Team periodically conducts training and drills in responding to a chlorine ton-container leak. CRWPCF operators are trained to provide a controlled response to chlorine leaks but limited to conducting an initial assessment and providing any necessary technical advice and support to the CRFD HAZMAT Team.  A Chlorine Institute Emergency B Kit, which includes the necessary tools and equipment for repairing ton container leaks, is available on-site for use by the CRFD HAZMAT Team. CRWPCF has provided an Emergency B Kit and an empty chlorine ton-container to the CRFD for training purposes."
