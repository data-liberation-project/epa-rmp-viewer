      "SummaryText": "The Westbrook Energy Center located in Westbrook, Maine generates electric power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine.  As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in a 29.5% aqueous solution in a 20,000 gallon vertical tank.  The ammonia is piped in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is diluted with air and heated to gas.  This gas is injected into the turbine exhuast gases in the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in an enclosed system as a heat reduction source to cool ambient air as the air flows into the turbine that is attached to a generator generating electricity.  This type of process is extremely efficient and commonly used.  Anhydrous Grade Ammonia serves as the most economically abundant and efficient heat transfer medium for industry refrigeration and heat reduction processes.\n\nThe facility has strictly implemented preventative maintenance procedures and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the ERP and contains all emergency contact numbers as well as employee safety and mitigation procedures.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for all employees on Hazardous Materials Handling, Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center has had no ammonia related accidents or releases.\n\nFor Aqueous Ammonia, the facility modeled two off-site consequence analysis.  The first was a worst case scenario that consisted of a full release of the aqueous ammonia storage tank which, due to administrative procedures, is 17,000 gallons (127,602 lbs) instantaneously.  However, the evaporation rate would be 2"

      "SummaryText": "2.3 lb/minute.  This scenario had a toxic endpoint radius of 0.3 miles.  The second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a delivery hose rupture.  The release would cause 500 pounds of aqueous ammonia to be spilled at a rate of 100 lbs/min for 5 minutes.  This scenario established a toxic endpoint radius of 0.1 miles.\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, the facility modeled two off-site consequence analysis.  The first was a worst case scenario that consisted of a full release of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank containing 19,400 lbs.  With an evaporation 1940 lb/minute.  This scenario had a toxic endpoint radius of 4.6 miles.  The second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a rupture disk/relief valve failure.  This scenario released 360 lbs. Of ammonia with an endpoint radius of 443 yards.\n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center has completed and is actively implementing a Risk Management Plan.  The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of the RMP."
