These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within SESA are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/-exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nSESA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nSESA maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup after an emergency shutdown, (7) operating limits, and (8) safety and health considerations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SESA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the anhydrous ammonia process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests,"

All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\nContractors\r\nSESA uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, SESA evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nSESA conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) performing and documenting inspections and results, (2) conducting maintenance training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\nManagement of Change\r\nSESA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the facility processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\nRelease Detection\r\n* H2S detectors with audible alarms\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature/pressure/flow rates)\r\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation\r\n* Atmospheric relief devices\r\n* Reinforced concrete containment \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(d)\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSESA has been operating since 2002.  The facility has an excellent record of accident prevention.  To date there have been no accidents that have occurred which resulted in offsite effects as defined in 40 CFR 68.  The following table is a summary of the number of accidents that have occurred during the past 5 years which resulted in:\r\n* on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage\r\n* offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, or environmental damage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r2002\r2003\r2004\r2005\r2006\rNumber of RMP Events with Onsite Effects\r0\r0\r0\r0\r0\rNumber of RMP Events with Offsite Effects\r0\r0\r0\r0\r0\r\r\n40 CFR 68.155(e)\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nSESA maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substances.  These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.\r\nPlant employees are trained to handle small emergencies only.  Employees are not trained to respond to RMP releases.  In the event of an RMP release, employees will activate shutdown procedures, evacuate the plant, and notify local e"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant processes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for SESA is coordinated with the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) organization.  CAER is a mutual aid organization consisting of multiple corporate entities located in the local area that coordinate all emergency response activities with the community response agencies.  SESA has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(f)\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nBased on the information detailed in the previous sections SESA has no current operational plans regarding changes to the existing safety procedures other than evaluating for continual improvement opportunities.  SESA has an active MOC system in place and is continuously training employees in safe operating procedures.   \r\n??\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\n??\r\n\r\n\t\tEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nShin-Etsu Silicones of America\t\tPage 1\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n40 CFR 68 Risk Management Plan"
