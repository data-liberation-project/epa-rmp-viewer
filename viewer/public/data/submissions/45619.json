      "SummaryText": "Hinsdale Farms is located in the town of Bristol, Indiana which is located approximately 8 miles northeast of Elkhart, IN and 1.5 miles south of the I-90. The facility manufactures corn dogs.  The facility employs 295 people at this location. The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain their product temperature. The system is defined as a closed loop ?direct? type system.\nHinsdale Farms has developed a risk management program to address 40 CFR Part 68 ?Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention? and to enhance already existing safety and emergency action programs. Hinsdale Farms is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Hinsdale Farms staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHinsdale Farms has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. Hinsdale Farms? policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used to maintain the temperature of the product. The ammonia refrigeration system cycle begins at the high pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the high pressure receiver to the recirculators/accumulators and from there to the heat exchangers.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature and evaporates while absorbing heat from the air.  A wet vapor mix is returned to the recirculators/accumulators form the heat exchanger where the moisture is separated from the"

      "SummaryText": " vapor.  The dry vapor is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure.  The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and condenses to a liquid and returns to the high pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n \nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per 40 CFR 68.25 regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity, over a ten (10) minute period. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive mitigation features were taken for the worst-case release scenario. An administrative control that limits the maximum fill level of the largest vessel was credited for the worst case scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by 40 CFR 68.22 regulations. RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm. The results show the off-site areas that will be affected. This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp. For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is located in the Hazard Assessment report located at the facility.  The results can be found in the RMP*Submit electronic submission.  Two alternative release scenarios were modeled.  One scenario credits an enclosure as passive mitigation and the other scenario does not credit any passive mitigation.  \nThe meteorological condi"

      "SummaryText": "tions specified by regulation 40 CFR 68.28 for alternative release scenarios were used. The EPA?s own RMP*Comp was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm. The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Hinsdale Farms has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n?    There are ammonia sensors in place to allow early detection of a release.\n?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this EPA Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were implemented by Hinsdale Farms to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized "
