The El Centro - WTP has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorination system.  The El Centro - WTP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \r\n\r\nThe El Centro - WTP is located at 1101 Danenberg Dr., El Centro, California 92243. The regulated substance at the facility is chlorine.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 20,000 pounds (Lbs.) and it is stored in pressurized one-ton chlorine containers at ambient temperature in liquid form.  The regulated substance, chlorine, is used at the facility for water treatment purposes. \r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\r\nPer CalARP Regulations and US EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2019 CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Five Year Update Binder. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\r\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the 2019  CalARP/RMP/PSM Program 3 Five Year Update Binder.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\n\r\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the El Centro - WTP has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-c"

From 19 CCR \u00a72750.9: \r\nThe owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of chlorine at the El Centro - WTP in the past five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe El Centro - WTP is not a First Responder Facility.  The Facility has implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 3220 (8 CCR \u00a73220) and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency.
