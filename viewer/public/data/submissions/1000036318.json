This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\t \r\n\r\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant, located in Stanton Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Y-Grade petroleum products from natural gas. The Sale Ranch Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\r\nY Propane\r\nY Normal Butane\r\nY Isobutane\r\nY Ethane\r\nY Methane\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the Sale Ranch Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of propane contained in a single vessel/storage tank. The maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank is 251,150 pounds. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nCheck Alternate Release\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Sale Ranch Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of Natural Gas Liquids from a 4\" transfer line, 1840 pounds released in 15 minutes. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.2 mile. Th"

There are no toxic substances held above the threshold quantities at the Sale Ranch Gas Plant.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require that public and environmental receptors be determined within the worst-case scenario area. In addition to the residential population, the presence of institutions, parks, commercial and industrial buildings are to be identified. The number of public receptors for the worst-case and alterative-case release scenarios was obtained from 2010 U.S. Census data. In addition the Circular Area Profiling System was used along with Google Earth to determine any receptors. There were no environmental receptors within the worst-case or alterative-case release scenario areas.\r\nOther considerations were made and verified that other potential worst-case scenarios were considered, specifically using the following criteria:\r\na.\tVessels containing less material but stored at higher temperature/pressures.\r\nb.\tVessels or other potential sources which were in closer proximity to the facility property line.\r\n\r\nThese other considerations involved the Product Storage Tank with maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank is 7140 gallons. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.1 miles.

This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way to address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Sale Ranch Gas Plant currently has a Process Safety Management (PSM) Coordinator on site that assists in maintenance of up-to-date process safety information.

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in Operator Procedures Manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains files that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.  Hazard and operability studies (HAZOP's) are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. Any audit findings are developed by the audit team and are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.

Curbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system.\r\n6. Atmospheric relief devices.\r\n \r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \r\n2. Deluge system for specific equipment\r\n3. Personnel trained in emergency action\r\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have been no accidental releases of regulated substances that resulted in onsite or offsite effects during the prior five years at the Sale Ranch Gas Plant. We investigate all incidents to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. The following table summarizes the number of incidents that have occurred during the past 5 years which had onsite or offsite effects. \r\n1. There have been no accidents to report in the last five years.\r\n\r\nNumber of RMP Events with Onsite and Offsite Effects \r\n1. There have been no events.\r\n \r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Sale"
