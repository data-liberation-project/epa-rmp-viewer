Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nContinental Cement Company, L.L.C. (CCC) is strongly committed to protection of its employees, the public and the environment.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is CCC's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, CCC has an emergency plan in place that is coordinated with the City of Hannibal Fire Department, the Hannibal Rural Fire Department and Marion-Ralls County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These local agencies provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \nCCC receives a mixture of solvents used as alternate fuel materials to replace use of coal.  Compounds in the fuel mixture currently do not exceed the threshold quantity for any substance listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  Therefore, CCC is not required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act.  However, the potential to exceed these threshold quantities does exist.  If the concentration of substances in future alternative fuel material changes, threshold quantities can be exceeded.  CCC routinely tests and closely monitors the quantities of these substances.  Therefore, CCC is submitting this RMP to insure that we are in compliance and that our neighbors are aware of our worst case emergency scenario.  \n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "ted approximately 3 miles south of downtown Hannibal, Missouri.  The original cement manufacturing facility was constructed in 1905.  The facility was continuously upgraded and enlarged to its current capacity.  The rotary cement kiln currently on-line was erected in 1966.  In 1986, CCC was granted interim status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to operate an alternative fuel facility.  A mixture of various substances, regulated as hazardous waste primarily due to flammability, are received, stored and prepared for use as fuel in the cement kiln.  These alternative fuels burn cleaner than coal and serve as a direct replacement of coal.  The alternative fuels consist of spent products such as paints, inks, solvents, oil, and other flammable or combustible organic materials.   Both solid and liquid alternative fuels are received.\nCCC tests these fuels regularly to determine concentrations and quantities of regulated substances as defined by our permit.  Since testing began, CCC has found that only one test period showed a concentration of a regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  This period occurred three years ago with the fuel material present on-site for less than one week.  Ethyl ether was observed in the storage tanks at a level of 16,100 lbs.  The regulated inventory of Ethyl ether is 10,000 lbs.  Therefore, CCC has based this \"Predictive Filing\" Risk Management Plan on the storage and processing of a flammable material, ethyl ether, assuming that it may be received in the future above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, CCC used the look-up tables and equations from Appendix D provided by the EPA in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document.  Modeling was also performed using Dyadem RMP-PRO software"

      "SummaryText": ".  Results from modeling were consistent with the EPA look-up tables.  The processes at CCC meet Program 1 eligibility requirements.  However, CCC has in place all the elements of Program 2.  Therefore, a worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario were analyzed.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe RMP is based upon Alternative Liquid Fuels Blending and Storage as a Program 2 process.  The worst case scenario considered for this process involves the flammable substance Ethyl Ether.  The quantity released in the scenario is assumed to be 50,000 lbs.  Passive mitigation considered in the scenario includes enclosures and sumps.  The tank area is roof covered and is provided with concrete containment large enough to hold the contents of the largest tank.  During the modeled worst case scenario, a leak occurs and the ethyl ether, from the tank, vaporizes.  A resulting vapor cloud explosion occurs having a distance to endpoint of 0.27 miles.  This distance is less than the distance (0.51 miles) to the nearest public receptor.  \n\nUnder the alternative release scenario, a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) was chosen.  The BLEVE is from a 25,000-gallon storage tank of ethyl ether (flammable) and yielded a worst case impact distance 0.26 miles.  This distance is again less than the distance (0.51 miles) to the nearest public receptor. \n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed utilizing guidance from the NFPA-58 Standard.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our site.  Our site is considered a stationary source.\n\nProcess "
