They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis facility is in the process of implementing Ammonia Process Safety Management Inc. (APSM), a powerful online tool to enable comprehensive and companywide standardization of PSM and RMP compliance related elements.  JBS USA and this facility will use this system to manage its compliance programs in an easily accessible online format that is also consistent, efficient, and provides effective control from the top down to enhance collaboration, efficiency, reporting and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  This program includes an emergency response notification plan, emergency response drills and drill evaluations.  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the local Fire Department and ensures that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation."

      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that the JBS - Souderton Beef Processing Facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\r\n\r\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. This facility has one refrigeration system using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in each system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RM Program standards.  \r\n\r\nJBS USA is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.   Our safety programs help to prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are d"
