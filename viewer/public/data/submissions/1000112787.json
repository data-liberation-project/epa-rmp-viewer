The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps are as follows:\n\nThis facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history is as follows:\n\nThere is no history of off-site releases from this facility.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program is as follows:\n\nThis facility is included in a local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, the Appleton Fire Department, and Bassett Mechanical. Bassett Mechanical is under contract to Miller for operation, maintenance, and emergency response for the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility. Miller has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify external emergency responders when necessary.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety are as follows:\n\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of their severity, are investigated following incident investigation procedures. The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from reoccurring. Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system at the Appleton facility. These procedures in conjunction with hazard analysis findings, audit findings, and continuous scrutiny of the system following mechanical integrity procedures result in continuous upgrades to minimize the likelihood of ammonia releases."

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are as follows:\n     \nAll operational and emergency response aspects of the ammonia system located at the Miller Electric Mfg. Co. facility are contracted to Bassett Mechanical.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled are as follows:\n\nThe primary activity at the Miller Electric Mfg. Co. facility is the manufacture of welding power sources and associated equipment. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the air conditioning system that serves this facility. The total amount of anhydrous ammonia that may be stored on-site is 17,060 pounds. The largest single component in the system may contain 10,800 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario is as follows:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the high-pressure receiver vessel would release 10,800 pounds of ammonia. The high-pressure receiver will never be filled to more than 80% of its capacity. It is assumed that the entire contents are released over a period of ten minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint, defined as 200 ppm, for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles, and affects a population of 14,155 persons, based on 2010 census data. In addition to private residences, this release scenario also affects several public receptors, including large commercial/industrial occupancies, recreational areas, schools, churches, and hotels. A nearby river is the sole environmental receptor affected by this scenario.\n\nAlternative Scenario - A release of ammonia through a pressure relief valve with a 3/4 outlet diameter, connected to the high-pressure receiver vessel at 250 psig, was considered for the alternative release scenario. This scenario is representative of a release more likely than the worst-case considered (above). The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles, and affects a population of 24 persons, based on 2010 census data. In addition to private residences, this scenario also affects industrial"
