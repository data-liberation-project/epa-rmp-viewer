Senior management commitment to safety has been established as a top-down function that includes employee involvement and associated agencies and appropriate vendors and contractors.  The Town of Jupiter policies include local response to small spills, 911 responses to releases and an on-going maintenance and training efforts that include appropriate documentation.\r\n\r\n2.0  Your facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe Town of Jupiter WTP provides potable drinking water to the residents of the Town of Jupiter, Town of Juno Beach, and in unincorporated areas of Palm Beach County and Martin County.  The Town uses chlorine gas injection for disinfection to make the drinking water potable.  This process has been in use for approximately 36 years.  The process is stable and no releases have occurred over this period.  The WTP produces an average of 15.5 million gallons per day (MGD) of water daily for a service area of 88,000 residents @ 2.43 people per residential connection.  There are 28,000 connections.  The WTP uses and estimated 1,675 lbs. of chlorine daily depending on the season of the year of chlorine with a total storage capacity of 80,000 lbs. or 40 containers.  Other substances are used but are well below the regulated EPA threshold limits.\r\n\r\n3.0  The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the two release scenarios of chlorine:\r\n\r\nThe worst case release is a one-ton container (2,000 pounds) of gaseous chlorine spewing at a release rate of 110 pounds per minute in a total of 600 seconds.  This release scenario has a potential of a 0.9-mile"

The alternate release could have a 0.1-mile radius plume dispersal and could negatively impact 80 persons and 25 public receptors (based on Jupiter GIS, 2010 Census).\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0   The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe details of the Town of Jupiter WTP Prevention Programs are contained in Part VI: Accident Prevention Programs of the written RMP document.  In the document, there are policies and procedures to ensure the continued safe operation of the chlorination process.  They include SOPs, employee awareness and involvement, maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process, procedures for management of change, revising and updating the process hazard analysis (PHA), performing pre-startup reviews and employee training.\r\n\r\n5.0  The five year accident history\r\n\r\nThe Jupiter WTP personnel have conducted a thorough record search and have not discovered any reportable releases in the history of the WTP.  This covers a period much longer than the five-year period.\r\n\r\nOccasional small chlorine leaks, associated with packing glands and valve stem packing have periodically occurred.  When these events occur, the contamination is quickly removed by the chlorine scrubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0  The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Jupiter WTP Emergency Response Program (ERP) and the Emergency Spill Response Program (ESRP) are presented in this RMP.  The Town of Jupiter policies are in effect that allows employee response to small releases.  Large releases are directed to the Palm Beach County Regional Hazardous Materials Response Team (PBCRHMRT) with 911 calls, and evacuation of the facility.\r\n\r\nPersonnel training"
