      "SummaryText": "Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities Department Risk Management Plan for chlorine handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazzards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of 40 CRF 68.170 are addressed in the plan which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency interaction.\n\nThe J.G. Beacham Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine to diinfect water withdrawn from the North and Middle Oconee Rivers and Bear Creek Reservoir.  The chlorination process includes chlorine storage cylinders, chlorination equipment, monitoring instrumentation, and a vacuum flow regulating system.\n\nAccidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case scenario\", defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" interaction.  The \"alternative scenario\" is defined as \"more likely to occur that the work-case release scenario.\"  In each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpint\".  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the J.G. Beacham Water Treatment Plant involves a failure of (1) one-ton cylinder yielding a cumalative release of 2,000 lb. of chl"

      "SummaryText": "orine.  Atmospheric dispersion modelingn for tis scenario ws performed using the EPA's RMP Comp.  The distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.9 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the mechanical failure of one flexible manifold connection allowing an accidental release from a one ton cylinder of chlorine over a period of 15 minutes.  The distance to enpoint ws determined to be 0.1 miles under normal atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe Beacham Water Treatment Plant has operated safely since its construction in 1935.  A process history review indicates that no reportable accidental releases have occurred within the past five years.\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to mitigate the effects of a potential chlorine release including operator training, a preventive maintenance program, process specific safety equipment and monitors, plus safe and effective standard operating procedures.  Furthermore, Athens-Clarke County Public Utilities has an environmental, health and safety program with the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process including a respiratory protection (SCBA), chemical right to know, hazard review of equipment and procedures, periodic auditing and inspection, and comprehensive management.\n\nThe J.G. Beacham Water Treatment Plant has an emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with the Athens-Clarke County Fire and Emergency Services Department, and Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The plan includes emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and facility tours conducted annually by the Fire and Emergency Services Department inspection.\n\nIn an effort to further enhance plant safety and readiness, the Beacham Plant will begin training to the readiness standards of 29 CFR 1910.120(q).\n\nFor additional information about this plan or any of Athens-Clarke County's water treatment plants, contact Raymond Winfrey by telep"
