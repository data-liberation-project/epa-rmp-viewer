      "SummaryText": " (a) Massena Energy Facility's (MEF's) training, operations execution and maintenance efforts are primarily geared for prevention of release of any hazardous material including especially anhydrous ammonia. For example, off-loading evolutions, which are the most likely time for an accidental release, are conducted by a trained driver and monitored at the loading area by an MEF operator and in the control room by the lead operator on shift via cctv and remote vessel monitoring (pressure and level). The two MEF operators remain in radio contact throughout the off-loading. Should a problem occur, the control room operator makes outside calls for notification and assistance as appropriate. Should a release occur, notification of the County Emergency Services organization using \"911\" activates response team personnel.\n\n(b) The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nAs an electric power plant, our primary activity is the generation of electric power for the grid. We have one reportable process at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, which is stored and used to control gas turbine and duct burner Nox emissions. The maximum inventory is 40242 lbs.\n\n(c) The Worst Case Release and Alternate Case Scenarios:\n\nWe have used the assumptions and models provided by EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Program, RMP*Comp ?for the following two scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank. The scenario assumes 40,242 lbs of ammonia is released as a gas in 10 minutes. No passive or active mitigation controls come into play during the release. Under worst case conditions, the maximum distance of 3.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario also involves a catastrophic  release from the ammonia system, this time during a transfer from a 6000 gallon delivery truck to the storage tank. It is assumed "

      "SummaryText": "that the hose fails and neither the driver nor the monitor are able to shut down the pump or shut off the delivery valve. Ammonia is released at a rate of 500 gallons per minute and no passive or active controls come into play. Under these conditions, the maximum distance is 0.4 miles for a toxic endpoint of  0.14 mg/L.\n\n(d) The accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThis facility was designed and built in accordance with the latest codes and requirements when construction took place including the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling systems. In addition, a sprinkler system was installed in 1995 to allow a \"knock down\" of any ammonia gas released in the vicinity of the storage tank. \n\nThe following parameters addressing release prevention are discussed in more detail in the facility's Process Safety Management Plan:\n\n-Formal operating procedures\n\n-Operating limits\n\n-Health and safety considerations\n\n-Safety systems\n\n-Safe work practices\n\n-Contractor control\n\n-Mechanical integrity\n\n(e) The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents or incidents in the last 5 years\n\n(f) The Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe employees are trained , and expected to be able to isolate systems and initiate the sprinkler system if ammonia concentrations caused by a release permit; they are also trained to deal with very minor leaks which may be contained and neutralized. However, MEF personnel will not respond to major ammonia releases other than to report the release to the St. Lawrence County LEPC who will provide emergency response personnel and conduct appropriate notifications.\n\n(g) Recent change which has improved safety:\n\nTwo leak detectors have been installed near the storage tank. Should either detector sense ammonia release the sprinkler system (water curtain) will automatically activate and an alarm is sounded in the control room. In the event the facility is unmanned this and any other alarm associated with ammonia systems is transmitted to a 24 hour desk which "
