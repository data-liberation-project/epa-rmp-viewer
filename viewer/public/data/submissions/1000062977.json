EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION 68.155\r\n\r\nThe City of Frederick Utilities Department operates the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant at 1950 North Market Street, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.   This plant is one of four water plants operated by the City.  The City also operates one wastewater treatment plant.  The Monocacy water plant as well as the Linganore water plant have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\r\n\r\n1.1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\r\nThe City of Frederick Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, training and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program as well as Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) 27-CFR-1910-119 under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\n1.2. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\r\nThe City of Frederick has a management system in place which is lead by the City's Mayor, who delegates implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements to the Public Works Department Deputy Director Operations.  The Deputy Director delegates the RMP program to the Utilities Assistant Deputy Director Operations who has responsibility for water treatment plant operations and RMP Program implementation.  The attached City organization chart defines the RMP program lines of authority.

PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (A) (2)\r\nThe City of Frederick maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically the Monocacy Water Treatment Plant.  The program address each of the EPA's, RMP Level 3 Program-listed 12 elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in place in the plant's OSHA PSM program.  The City is in compliance with both.  These documents are maintained and implemented by City of Frederick's Water Treatment Superintendent and by the City's Safety and Safety Coordinator.  \r\n\r\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe City of Frederick Monocacy Water Treatment Plant employs eight (8) full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the water disinfection treatment process.\r\n\r\n2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\r\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Frederick and managed by its Public Works Department.  The site is located at 1950 North Market Street, Frederick, Frederick County, Maryland.  The site is located in an industrial area on North Market Street.\r\nThe plant includes a separate chlorine storage feed room/control room which also houses the injection feed distribution system.  The chlorinated water feeds various injector points in the plant.  \r\nChlorinated water beyond the chlorine control room is outside of the boundaries of this RMP process.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include: full or in use 150-pound cylinders in the Chlorine Cylinder Storage Feed Control /Chlorination Control Room.  Alos included are all associated emergency vent scrubber (New 1027) vent makeup air, exhaust systems and chlorine injection units in the area that supports the system.  It also includes the empty cylinder storage on the dock in front of the Chlorination Room.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings ("

REGULATED SUBSTANCE (B) (2)\r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on-site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The City of Frederick chlorine process was installed as part of the process of disinfecting and purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MD DEP). \r\nThe chlorine is received and stored in 150-pound cylinders.  Six cylinders are in the in-use bank and the stand by bank.  Each cylinder has a chlorine vacuum check regulator mounted on it.  The vacuum lines from these six units are manifolded into a bank.  There two banks, one on-line the other on standby.  The on-line bank feeds chlorine to two process control systems.  The chlorine from the cylinder's chlorinator is drawn into the injectors by high pressure water flow.  The resultant chlorinated water flows into the plant's water system.\r\n\r\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula CL2.  Chlorine is an oxidizing agent that is non-flammable.  It has a one ppm OSHA ceiling (15-minute) permissible exposure limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe.  The immediate dangerous health (IDLH) level is 10 ppm and a lethal concentration (LC-5O) is 250 ppm.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\r\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is forty-two (42) cylinders of 150 lbs. each.  This equals 6,300 pounds.  \r\n\r\n3.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed in March 2017 to determine the effects a release would have on the plant, the public and environmental receptors surrounding the plant.  The tobe installed chlorine emergence vent scrubber, the revised chlorine cylinder control system and the new emergency generator were included in the Marc"

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios; a worst case and an alternative case.  The City maintains a Five-Year Accident History for the WTP chlorine system (see Section 4 below; five-year accident history).\r\n\r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted.  The first is a worst case release.  The second is a more probable alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint.  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals three ppm.  The three ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n\r\n3.1.

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D)\r\nThe City of Frederick accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM/RMP programs have been effectively used for many years.  They are part of the plant's operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the overall Water Division-wide program and the Water Treatment Plant site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  Both are coordinated with the Frederick County Fire/Rescue Department (including the HazMat Team), the Fort Detrick HazMat Team and the Regional LEPC.\r\n\r\n4.1.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (D) (1)\r\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\r\nThe City of Frederick has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.\r\nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.   This system is computer based.  \r\nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous, toxic properties and effects of all chemicals used.  \r\nMaintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment.  The maintenance program uses a computer based work order system for scheduled mechanical integrity as well as for unplanned repairs and maintenance.  \r\nIncident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident.  If there is a chlorine release, significant injury, property damage or an incident that could have catastrophic results, an investigating team is formed within 48 hours.  The team r"

Employees are also Safety Committee Members, Process Hazards Review Members, Accident Investigation Team Members, and assist in the development of the various P&Ps. \r\nSafe work practices are used throughout the facility including: 1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lockout/Tagout Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical Lines.\r\nContractors must meet The City of Frederick's high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.  In addition, City of Frederick demands training of contractors to its standards.\r\n\r\n4.2.  CHLORINE SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (D) (2)\r\n\r\n4.2.1.  Chlorine-Specific Operating Safety Information\r\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine specific program.  These include:\r\n4.2.2.  Specific procedures for the management of the chlorine process\r\nThere is a specific procedure for the completion of a Management of Change for all modified and/or new processes.  This is followed by completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified or new chlorine system.  There are specific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures for small releases and in the emergency response procedures for large releases.  See the Emergency Response Program manual.  There is specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine.  Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key in the operations manual of the chlorine system.\r\n\r\n4.2.3.  Facility Design\r\nThe plant includes a combined chlorine storage feed room/control room which meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e storage area/control building room is equipped with an emergency vent scrubber also an exhaust fan ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the room.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms and a flashing red light illuminates as well as in the water plant control room.  The alarm system is tied into the emergency generator and security system which alerts management.\r\n\r\n4.2.4.  Equipment Design\r\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high pressure and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine cylinder piping system consists of a yoke and chlorine gas vacuum check regulator on each of the six 150 lb. cylinders.  A flexible tube connects from each cylinder gas vacuum check regulator to the header that has a main block valve.  These parts are made of high pressure anhydrous (elemental) chlorine compatible materials; steel, copper or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is 150 psig, giving a three-to-one safety factor.  There are six 150-pound cylinders in a single bank and each has a gas chlorinator, these are manifolded into a single feed for the in use bank.  There is another bank of six 150-pound cylinders on standby.  One bank is in service and the other is on standby.  Each cylinder has a fusible plug to release pressure if the cylinder temperature is over 155 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure to 13 inches of mercury.  A pressure relief valve is in each to the regulators.  The valve vents if the pressure in the line reaches over several inches of water pressure.  All the pipes, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum (negative) pressure in it.  An area chlorine monitor detects the presence of chlorine in the storage/chlorine control room.\r\n\r\n5"

PERSONNEL (F) (1)\r\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Frederick's prevention program.  City employees make up the operators and emergency first response teams.  The City of Frederick fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine system operations including participation in:\r\n\u00bf\tAccident/Incident Investigation Team\r\n\u00bf\tPSM/RMP safety teams\r\n\u00bf\tDevelopment of the operation procedures\r\n\u00bf\tHazard evaluations\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazards Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOn-going training of the operators and other involved staff\r\n\r\n8.  CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (G)\r\nChanges to improve safety are in progress.  These include installation of an emergency backup generator, an emergency scrubber, chlorine cylinder pipe configurations and upgrade of the normal ventilation system.  During the PHA these were reviewed.  Also, recommended actions were identified in the internal safety HazOp and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program.  These recommended actions have to be evaluated and implemented as required.  Audits were conducted to review the RMP program in 1999, April 2005, May 2010 and August 2014.  The key safety action items were completed.  Additional video monitoring cameras were added to our surveillance system.  The City of Frederick continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the City of Frederick management team and process safety team are reviewing potential upgrades to the existing design of the chlorine operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of chlorine.\r\nThe City of Frederick"
