      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n  In response to the Santa Barbara County Protection Services Division directive, and as stipulated in sections 25534 of the Health and Safety Code, and California Code of Regulations, Title 19 (19CCR), Section 2735.4(a)(2) this Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed for the newly constructed California Giant Inc. produce cooling and shipping facility in Santa Maria, California.   The purpose of this RMP is to:\n\n     \u00b7Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response   \n      and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n\n      \u00b7Assist Cal Giant and the local governmental agencies in their communication and coordination\n       efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\n\n This document addresses the AHM system used for the produce refrigeration process at the Cal Giant Inc. facility.  The AHM used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that circulate and store the ammonia will be the subject of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\nCal Giant Inc. is located within the city limits of Santa Maria, California, in a predominately agricultural area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility.   The facility was recently constructed on this site, will begin operations in March 2003, and will operate seasonally each year.   Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the pre-cooling and refrigerated warehouse system with a total charge of approximately 6000 lbs., and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site in reportable quantities.   The balance of the facility located on the approximate 10 acre site consists of 7,500 sq ft of related office space and 22,200 sq ft of crate shed.   The risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the plant refrigeration system was"

      "SummaryText": "allowed to escape into the atmosphere.   In the worst-case scenario the toxic end point is located off the property, the alternate release scenario was selected as being the most likely event that could have a toxic endpoint located off of the subject property.   Events, which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Review were:  equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, and acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   Direct contact with the released ammonia vapor by people inside the toxic endpoint is the main area of concern.\n\n       The worst-case release scenario considered was as required, specifically being the release of 100% of the ammonia contained within the largest vessel over a 10-minute period.   The analytical results of this scenario shows a distance to the toxic endpoint of approximately 1.1 miles, which includes mainly one other produce cooler, and agricultural land with some residential development towards the southern outer edges of the toxic endpoint.   The alternative release scenario chosen as the most likely event involves the release of 300 lbs. of ammonia over a 30-minute period from a leaking valve or cracked pipe.   The distance to the toxic endpoint would be less than .1 miles in this case.   Both scenarios can result in off-site impacts.\n\nPrevention of an accidental ammonia release is addressed by the following:\n               1.   System design and construction\n               2.   Administrative controls\n\nAdministrative controls and policies to be used in the event of a release are contained in the   \" Hazardous Materials Management Plan - 2002\", and the \"Business Response Plans and Procedures - 2002\".   The major topics covered by these documents are:\n\n               1.   Emergency Contact List\n               2.   Emergency Coordination Team"

Employee Training\n\nRisk reduction steps have been and continue to be implemented by Cal Giant Inc. to: minimize the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia, and in the event of an accidental release, to minimize the effects upon the surrounding properties.  The essential risk reduction steps to be implemented at the new facility are:\n               1.   Regular daily equipment observations\n               2.   Maintaining equipment maintenance records\n               3.   Maintaining records of previous releases/causes           \n               4.   Mechanical and electrical system controls automatically maintain the correct system\n                      temperatures and pressures, and provide safety shut-down and pressure relief in the event\n                      that the system operates out of the design limits.\n               5.

The failure of a refrigeration system to operate during a power outage poses no risk of an ammonia release since loss of power simply stops the flow of ammonia within the system.   In the event of a post-earthquake fire at the site, water for firefighting and/or ammonia vapor control would be drawn from the private water system.  The post-earthquake functionality of the water system thus depends on the vulnerability of PG&E and the water system to earthquake induced failure, which is unknown."
