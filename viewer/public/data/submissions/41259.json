If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify the Van Wert City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled.  This facility sells anhydrous ammonia directly to area farmers.  We have (2) 18,000 gallon storage tanks on site.  These storage tanks are equipped with releif valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and two remote shut off valves.  The remote shutoff valves can be tripped from approximately 30 feet from the loading areas.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  Our worst-case scenario is failure on one of the 18,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the maximum of 80%, resulting in a toxic release.  According to EPA'S look up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 3.2 miles.  This would affect approximately 10,922 people.  This event would be very unlikely with the process controls in use.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical -specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA regulations at 29 CFR 1910.38 and state EPCRA laws.\n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Van Wert City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the "
