RGP is offloaded into and loaded from DOT regulated onsite pipeline breakout tanks (not regulated by RMP). \n\n\n\nThe RGP railcar offloading/loading process was constructed in accordance with American Petroleum Industry Code #2510 (Design and Construction of LPG Installations) and it is the Facility's policy to follow the most current future editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. In addition, BOSTO Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving RGP which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nBOSTCO Terminal maintains an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) that has been updated to include the RGP system. Employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies. Training includes Emergency Response (HAZMAT), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems.
