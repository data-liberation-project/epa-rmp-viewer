Gibbon Packing Company (Gibbon Packing) facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Gibbon Packing employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Gibbon Packing owned activities at this facility.\nGibbon Packings management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nGibbon Packing operates a cow slaughter, processing, and hide washing and curing facility at this location.  Cows are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Gibbon Packing operates rendering systems for dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, and inedible tallow.  Support operations include cold storage and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a"

      "SummaryText": " specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B '68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Gibbon, Nebraska facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\nAmmonia\nThe data provided in the document Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPAs RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid, the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the high-pressure receiver in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 16,"

      "SummaryText": "751 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 1,675.1 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high pressure accumulator is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.48 miles (2.38 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 57.7 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 57.7 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 41.4 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the Bac Tower relief valve located approximately 10 feet above the ground surface.\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of Gibbon Packings operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 41.1 lbs/min, the duration for a 500 pound release is 12 minutes.  Other assumptions include, no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.06 miles (97 meters) from the release poin"

These regulations include:\n? 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n? 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n? 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n? 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n? 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key concepts in Gibbon Packings release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  Gibbon Packing has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Gibbon Packing management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia systems.  Gibbon Packing employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nGibbon Packing policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Gibbon Packing maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nGibbon Packing is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.

Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of Gibbon Packings emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\nFive Year Accident History\nGibbon Packing has had one release of ammonia from the Gibbon, Nebraska facility that resulted in one OSHA recordable injury.  During routine rounds, an employee entered the engine room and immediately smelled ammonia.  The employee went to the guard shack and called IBP management and maintenance.  The employee later reported that they lost consciousness.  There were no witnesses to this event.  The incident occurred on February 3, 1998 and the release did not affect the public or the environment.  IBP does not have records of the time and duration of the release or the release quantity.
