              "Description": "Supervalu's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (Mechanical Integrity)for the components of the ammonia refrigeration system, and programs for Mangement of Change (MOC)to the ammonia refrigeration system, process hazard analysis (PHA),and Pre- Startup Safety Review. The program also includes operating procedures for the safe operation of the refrigeration system, specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to weldingand similar hot work), and safety requiremenst for contractors (Contractor Qualifications)who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. Supervalu has a procedure in place for perfroming incident investigations to ensure root causes are identified and corrective actions are taken to minimize the potential for the recurrence of incidents. The program also has a procedure for conducting Compliance Audits to ensure that the PSM program is being implemented at the facility. The PSM written program  also incoporates the facilities emergency response plan and places special emphasis on the handling of accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response activities with the local fire department and other emergency response organizations.

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment.  Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.  \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, SuperValu Inc, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of SuperValu HarrisburgA?s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, SuperValu Harrisburg is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the SuperValu Harrisburg facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigerat"

The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the SuperValu Harrisburg building.  A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4.

To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, SuperValu Harrisburg is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  SuperValu Harrisburg has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  SuperValu Harrisburg conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSuperValu Harrisburg is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows SuperValu Harrisburg to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of SuperValu Harrisburg employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
