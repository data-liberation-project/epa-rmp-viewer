The Painesville Plant maintains an Emergency Response Team and has complied with federal requirements under the Process Safety Management program.\n\nRecognizing the growing public concern with chemical exposure and being a long-standing member of the Chemical Manufacturing Association, Uniroyal Chemical - Painesville has been a charter member of Lake County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Also, Uniroyal Chemical - Painesville was a charter member of the Painesville Township Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  Uniroyal Chemical - Painesville has been a leader in both of these organizations for nearly 10 years.\n\nThe following programs were already in place at the plant prior to the promulgation of the RMP regulation:\n\nOperator training and certification,\nSafety Incentive Program,\nOn-going Maintenance Safety Training,\nOn-going Staff Safety Training,\nEmergency response training,\nRoutinely updated operating procedures,\nComputers and computerized control systems,\nEmergency control / shutdown devices / interlocks,\nEquipment / piping safety controls,\nWarning alarms,\t\nRegular safety checks,\nEquipment inspections,\nManagement of change controls,\nHazard reviews, and\nProcess Hazard Analyses.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION and BACKGROUND\n\nUniroyal Chemical - Painesville (formerly U. S. Rubber Company) established a presence in Lake County in 1949 when a newly constructed vinyl chloride and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant was purchased from Glenn L. Martin.  Production of PVC was the central focus at the site and expansions continued through mid-1960.  Vinyl Chloride monomer was produced at the plant until the early 1960's.  This part of the operations was moved to Geismar, Louisiana as part of a"

      "SummaryText": "joint venture with Borden to produce the monomer.  PVC was produced at the plant until 1977 when Uniroyal exited the business.\n\nA major expansion for the site occurred in 1965 when the company moved production of nitrile rubber (NBR) to Painesville.  The new NBR plant was built at the same time as the last PVC expansion.  In the mid-1960's, the capacity of the plant was rated at 100MM pounds of PVC annually and 25MM pounds of NBR annually.\n\nIn 1979, the NBR plant was expanded to a capacity of 40MM pounds annually.  As of early 1997, over 1 billion pounds of NBR (Paracril) and NBR/PVC blend (Paracril OZO) had been produced at the Painesville site.  NBR is used in the manufacture of hose, sponge, shoe soles, seals, and gaskets.\n\nRMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThree chemicals covered by the RMP regulation are in use at the plant.  These chemicals are Anhydrous Ammonia, Acrylonitrile, and Butadiene.\n\nTOXIC RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is unloaded from a specially designed tank truck.  This chemical is used as a refrigerant in the process building.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia in the cooling system is about 28,000 pounds, most of that is held in three reservoir tanks on the roof of the process building.  Since the cooling system is a closed system, the anhydrous ammonia is transferred from truck to the system very infrequently.\n\nAcrylonitrile (AN) is unloaded from railcars into a 30,000 gallon tank.  This tank is dedicated to AN storage and is located in a tank farm.  Unloading takes place on a regular basis, about two or three times per week.  AN is pumped (via overhead line) from the tank farm to the process building where it is contained in a weigh tank prior to charging the reactors.  AN is one of two monomers which are the building blocks in the polymerization of nitrile rubber.\n\nFLAMMABLE RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nButadiene (BDE) is also unloaded from railcars on a regular basis.  BDE is stored in an 80,000-gallon horizontal tank, which is in a"

BDE is pumped from the pure BDE  storage tank to a 10,000-gallon ?day tank? where it is blended with recycled BDE from the process building.  BDE is pumped (via overhead line) from the ?day tank? to the process building where it is contained in a weigh tank prior to the charging of the reactors.  BDE is one of the two monomers that are the building blocks in the polymerization of nitrile rubber.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe off-site consequence analyses of these scenarios was performed using the RMP*Comp modelling software.  Population estimates were obtained through the Lake County Emergency Planning Commission and adjusted by examining aerial photographs of the region.\n\nWORST CASE - Toxics\n\nThe toxic worst case was found to be a catastrophic failure of the 26,500-gallon acrylonitrile storage tank.  The scenario considered here was the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the tank into a concrete dike surrounding the tank.  A toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/l is reached within a radius of 1.1 miles around the tank.  This radius includes a residential population of about 2,600 people.  No environmental receptors, as defined in the RMP regulations, were noted within this radius.\n\nWORST CASE - Flammables\n\nThe flammable worst case was found to be the vapor cloud explosion of a full 80,000-gallon butadiene tank and five nearby railcars, each containing about 20,000 gallons of butadiene.  The estimated distance to a 1 psi overpressure point was 0.8 miles from the center of the explosion.  This radius includes a residential population of about 750 people.  No environmental receptors, as defined in the RMP regulations, were noted within this radius.\n\n\nALTERNATE CASES - Toxics\n\nTwo alternate cases were considered for the toxic substances, acrylonitrile and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFor acrylonitrile, the alternate case considered was the rupture of a 2-inch transfer line f"
