The process for producing polyurethane foam requires the use Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). TDI is listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) list of regulated substances. Consequently, Foamex is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR). The same properties that give TDI commercial value are the characteristics that make it a hazardous material. Prior to RMPR, Foamex recognized the chemical and physical hazards involved with TDI and has observed safety precautions in its handling.  These precautions have been implemented to help limit exposure to the public, environment and our employees.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Effective implementation and monitoring of our accidental release prevention program helps us facilitate our Management System in the interest of reducing the possibility of accidental releases and proper mitigation in the event of an accidental release. \n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\nA review of the census 2000 data identified that there was one person living within our \"Toxic Endpoint\".   However, a physical search of the area revealed that no one lives within .5 mile of the plant.   \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Prevention Program (Program 2).  Foamex, Santa Teresa is not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard in that TDI is not listed on OSHA's list of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Consequently, our covered process is not subject to Program 3, therefore we are subject to Program 2. \n\nFive-y"
