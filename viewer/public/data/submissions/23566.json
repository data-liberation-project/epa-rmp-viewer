              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the enviroment that are associated with accidental releases of NH3.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the NH3 from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of NH3.  In addition to annual training for emplyees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site trainng at the plant, and follow-up observatio to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its emplyees on NH3, the company cooperative fully in their endeavors.",

If an emergency were to occure, it is out policy to notify the Buffalo Center Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owned cooperative.  We sell agricultural products to memebers and non-members.  We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of two 30,000 gallon storage tanks which are plumbed together.\n\nOur worst case senario would be the sudden relearse of both tanks at one time when they were filled to capacity.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles with an approximate population of 1686 people. Since this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the town of Buffalo Center, provisions have been designed to notify all affected person.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nOur alternate senerio would to the accidental pull-away by a recieving transport unit without the disconnecting the trnsfer hose.  According to the EPA look-up tables, the end point would be .10 miles with an appoximate poplulation of 5 people.  All employees working at this facility have been trained on how to respond to this type of scenario.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emerbency involving out NH3 plant, it is our policy to notify the Buffalo Center Fire Department and request that they respond to the ejmergency. We have discussed this policy withthe fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our proceedures or policies."
