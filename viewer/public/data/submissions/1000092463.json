This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Waco Fire Department and the McLennan County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures sports beverages, juice, drinks and other various commercial drink products. Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity. It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The facility utilizes two (2) individual and separate single-stage closed-loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems. The existing primary anhydrous ammonia system has a maximum capacity of 44,780 pounds and has been operational since December of 1998. The smaller, secondary system, installed in 2020, has a maximum capacity of 7,660 pounds. The system's purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products. Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenar"

      "SummaryText": "ios, the USEPA's RMP*Comp, was used.  RMP*Comp is designed to model the atmospheric dispersion of ground-level area source dense gas clouds released with zero momentum into an atmospheric boundary layer over flat, level terrain. The inputs for the RMP*Comp model were determined using the assumptions and equations provided in EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (USEPA, 2009).\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of the low-pressure receiver. The low-pressure receiver has a capacity of 44,780 pounds based on vessel dimensions; however, the maximum quantity stored in the receiver at any one time is physically limited to 13,117 pounds. Based on this information a release quantity of the entire vessel (13,117 pounds) is assumed. As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the worst case scenario assumes the release occurs over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 721 pounds per minute.  The vessel is located inside the facility engine room, which has an overhead door; however, the release rate is considered unmitigated since the proximity of the storage vessel to the door prevents the use of the door as passive mitigation. Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed) as required by the RMP rule, RMP*Comp yielded a distance of 1.0 mile to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) (\"zone of influence\"). The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 5,521 based on US Census Bureau information from EPA's MARPLOT program. Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include schools and commercial/industrial areas. No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated; however, when they were modeled none of them reached a toxic endpoint offsite. For the purpose of this RMP submission, the foll"

      "SummaryText": "owing alternative release scenario was chosen because it is the most likely to occur that would potentially release a significant amount of ammonia. The scenario chosen involves the failure of a 0.25 inch safety relief valve in the high pressure part of the primary ammonia system. This scenario could also be representative of multiple situations such as a small hole in a vessel or pipe, a pinpoint hole in a condenser coil, or a packing leak around a valve stem. Due to the presence of an alarm system and isolation valves and based on a recent release event, the release would occur over a 15 minute timeframe. Under default weather conditions, RMP*Comp yielded a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles. The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 0 based on US Census Bureau information from EPA's MARPLOT program. Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include commercial/industrial areas. No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.
