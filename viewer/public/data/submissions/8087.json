SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC EVELUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THE FACILITY NEEDS SOME UPDATING ON SOME EQUIPMENT.  WE ANTICIPATE BECAUSE OF SHIPPING AND THE TIME FACTOR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE TANKS READY TO UPDATE WITHIN A YEAR.  WE HAVE THREE LOCATIONS AND BECAUSE WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIROMENT TO WORK IN WE WILL CORRECT CHANGES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."
