Johanna Foods, Inc. has operated its ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system following its RMP Program. The RMP Program\r\nwas developed in 1991 to comply with New Jersey's Toxic\r\nCatastrophe Prevention Act. The Standard Operating Procedures,\r\nPreventative Maintenance Program, Management of Change Program,\r\nEmergency Response Plan, and other elements of the RMP Program\r\nhave developed over the years to further improve the safety,\r\nreliability, and risk reduction of the ammonia refrigeration\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n                      Johanna Foods, Inc.\r\n\r\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has three production plants on one site.\r\nThe Juice Plant packages chilled juice products in half gallon,\r\nquart and pint paper containers that require refrigeration for\r\nprocessing and storage. The Aseptic Plant packages juice products\r\nin Brik Pak containers (drink boxes) in a variety of sizes and\r\nflavors that requires refrigeration for processing but not for\r\nstorage. The Yogurt Plant packages yogurt products in cup\r\ncontainers of various sizes, styles, and flavors that require\r\nrefrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is\r\nthe regulated chemical that is used as the refrigerant. The\r\nquantity of anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration\r\nsystem  on site varies up to 55,000 pounds. The anhydrous ammonia\r\nis not consumed or produced by the refrigeration system.

The Standard\r\nOperating Procedures are used for every task performed on the\r\nrefrigeration system. All equipment is checked daily using\r\nchecksheets from the S.O.P.'s Steady State Operations section.\r\nThe Preventative Maintenance Program requires checksheets to\r\ninspect all refrigeration equipment in greater detail every six\r\nmonths, yearly testing of all safety interlocks and controls, and\r\na five year schedule to replace safety relief valves. Any repairs\r\nrequired by the inspections are tracked with a PC based Work\r\nOrder System. Any modification to the system is performed\r\nfollowing the Management of Change Program. The M.O.C. requires a\r\ndispersion analysis to determine if the change could cause\r\noffsite impact or not. Offsite impact would result in performing\r\na risk assessment of the change to identify all hazards and items\r\nto further reduce the risk of a release. All EHS operators are\r\ntrained in all aspects of the RMP and annual refresher training\r\nis performed high lighting any changes to procedures or\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\n                   Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\n     There have been no accidents.\r\n\r\n                    Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\n     Johanna Foods, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan that\r\naddresses emergency situations including an anhydrous ammonia\r\nrelease.

The guard also follows procedures to\r\nnotify the Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC), or an alternate,\r\nto command the Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT members at\r\nthe effected area don SCBAs and perform a search of the effected\r\narea. The ERC radios the EVC by radio for the result of the\r\nheadcount and informs the response team of any missing personnel\r\nto search for. The ERC follows the Emergency Response Plan which\r\nincludes procedures on how to contact local emergency responders\r\nsuch as police, fire department, rescue squad, and LEPC. Once all\r\npersonnel and accounted for the EHS operators of the ERT start to\r\nisolate the release and monitor the area. The ERT is made up of\r\nEHS operators, production operators who have first aid training,\r\nand various maintenance personnel to assist in an emergency. Site\r\npersonnel are trained annually on the evacuation procedures. The\r\nERT is trained annually on the procedures of the Emergency\r\nResponse Plan and the use of Emergency Response Equipment.
