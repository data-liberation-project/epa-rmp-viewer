The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City of Davis's Water Pollution Control Plant is located at 45400 Co. Rd. 28H, Davis, CA in Yolo County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located in a rural area between the Yolo County Sanitary Landfill and the Yolo Bypass.  There are 17 full-time employees at this site. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton container scales and storage trunnions in a fenced enclosure.  The chlorine is used  to disinfect the wastewater effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Liquid or"

      "SummaryText": " gaseous chlorine or sulfur dioxide is withdrawn from ton containers and evaporated (as needed) to gas in an electrically-heated evaporator with a water bath surrounding a pressure vessel.  Pressurized gas from the evaporator is reduced in pressure at a pressure reducing valve and further reduced to vacuum at a vacuum valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators and sulfonators, and drawn into water solution by the vacuum induced at a submerged high-speed impeller in an inductor unit.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Davis that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Davis has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the City of Davis are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs. The City of Davis has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its disinfection and dechlorination pro"

The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, confirming that the alarm autodialer system is tested monthly, and creation of a facility-specific written procedures for chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery and system maintenance are performed with periodic training.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe City of Davis's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Yolo County Office of Emergency Services, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination. The Water Pollution Control Plant maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases at its facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which the City of Davis committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n"
