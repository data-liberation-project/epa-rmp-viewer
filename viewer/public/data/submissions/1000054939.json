ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n\n\n     The Hamakua PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing,\n\nimplementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program. The\n\nHamakua PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia\n\nselective catalytic NOx reduction (SCR/DeNOx) system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on\n\nthe shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program. Operating\n\nlevel employees, particularly the Operations Superintendent, the Plant Engineer and the System Operators,\n\nhave been deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they\n\nassume the major responsibility for operating the Honokaa, Hawaii facility safely.\n\nThe Hamakua Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support\n\nof the Hilo Fire Department. All Hamakua employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\n\n     The Hamakua Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Hilo Fire Department.

SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\n     Please refer to onsite documentation for Offsite Consequence data\n\n\n\nIV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia supply and SCR/DeNOx system.  Further, SCR/DeNOx system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the SCR/DeNOx system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia SCR/DeNOx system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located in the DCS logic, alarms actuated by high release concentrations of ammonia, and safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the ammonia system is ensured via the use of a computerized maintenance management system.  \n\n\n\nV.  5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n     During the past five years this facility has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\nVI.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\n     This power generating facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local volunteer fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.  The Hawaii LEPC has been notified regarding the HEP emergency action plan and of the potential nature of an anhydrous ammonia release.\n\n\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENT \n\n\n\n     Hamakua Energy Partners is committed to continuous improvement of the safety programs for i"
