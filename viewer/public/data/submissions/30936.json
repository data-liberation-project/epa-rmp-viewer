      "SummaryText": "The Wastewater treatment plant is located in the southeast part of Titus Count, east of U.S. Highway 271. Facilities are in place to store one ton cylinders of chlorine and to utilze these cylinders in the application of chlorine to the wastewater treatment plant efluent to achieve disinfection. The properties of chlorine that make it useful in the disinfection of wastewater make it necessary to observe safety precautions that will prevent exposre to chlorine thereby reducing the threat to the plant employees and also, to reduce the threat to the persons in the community. Chlorine is considered a hazardous chemical by the Environmental Protection Agency. Trainig of employees when they begin to work and following the Prevention 2 Program recommendations should result in operating procedures that would allow a continuation of the previous five year period without a reportable accident. A chlorine detector is mounted in the area to detect chlorine leaks. Accidental release prevention is in effect and copies are retained in a manual available at the plant. Emergency Response Policies have been reviewed and are kept at the wastewater treatment facilites along with  the RMP Manual."
