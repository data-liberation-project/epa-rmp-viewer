In the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the control room and activate an emergency generator system, which provides backup power to run the water treatment plant.\n\n\tThe ammonia system consists of three ammonia bulk storage tanks, an ammonia containment tank, eight ammonia absorbers, two small filters, two feed pumps, one transfer pump, and a secondary containment system (dike), including a sump.  The bulk storage tanks will store ammonia during normal operation, while the containment tank is used in case of an emergency (transfer of aqueous ammonia from the sump and the containment are).  All four tanks are ASME rated at 40 psig.  Each bulk storage tank has an overflow line from the top of the tank piped to the containment sump through a drain funnel.  All tanks have a vacuum relief valve and a two-unit pressure relief system.  The pressure relief valve low range (self-contained) unit is set at 25 psig, while the high range (pilot activated) unit is set at 28 psig.  The vacuum-relief valve is set at \u00bf1.0psig.  The low range pressure relief valve is vented to the absorbers and the high range pressure relief valve is connected to the overflow line. There are a total of 8 ammonia absorbers, two for each of the three storage tanks and two are shared by the containment tank and the sump. \n\n\tEach of the bulk storage tanks, the containment tank, and the sump have ultrasonic-type level sensors to continuously monitor aqueous ammonia levels, and high and low level alarms.  The sump also has two ammonia vapor detection sensors.  When a high or low aqueous ammonia level in the tanks is detected or an ammonia vapor leak in the sump is detected, alarm signals are sent to the computer in the control room.\n\n\tAqueous ammonia is withdrawn from the bulk storage tanks through filters by the feed pumps until it reaches the injection point.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California. MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the Robert B. Diemer Water Treatment Plant (Diemer Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWOSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nDiemer Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe Diemer Plant also stores and handles 19.5 percent concentration aqueous ammonia in amounts exceeding the CalARP Prog"

Ammonia is used at the Diemer Plant to convert free chlorine to monochloramines in the drinking water disinfection process.  It should be noted that aqueous ammonia of concentration less than 20 percent is not one of the regulated toxic substances listed in the RMPR.  Thus, aqueous ammonia is not subject to RMPR.  It has also been determined that the ammonia facility qualifies as a Program 1 process under the CalARP regulation.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary:\n?\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n?\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information.\n?\tSummary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n?\tFive-year accident history summary.\n?\tEmergency response program summary.\n?\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWOSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine and aqueous ammonia involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable CalARP and RMPR Prevention Program requirements are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for hazardous materials, including chlorine and aqueous ammonia, involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  Diemer Plant has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials a"

      "SummaryText": "nd facilities in the event of an emergency.  This emergency response plan has been updated to reflect the containment and scrubbing system and is being coordinated with local response agencies (Orange County Fire Authority and Anaheim Fire Department).  Diemer Plant has had an excellent safety record of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Diemer Plant is located at 3972 Valley View Avenue in Yorba Linda, California.  The plant is situated north of the State Highway 91, and just east of State Highway 57 covering 200 acres.  The plant is designed to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  The facility stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules, as well as the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  T\n\nThe chlorination system at the Diemer Plant is located inside the Chlorine Containment Building.  Chlorine leak detectors are provided at various locations in the Chlorine Containment Building and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then automatic start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shutdown of the normal ventilation system, and, finally, automatically closing supply valves.  A packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either chlorine storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.  Caustic soda (20%) is used as the scrubbing media.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the chlorination facility and beside the scrubber system.\n\nThe chlorine pressure reducing valves, vacuum regulator valves, leak detectors, and computer control system are connected to uninterruptible power supply"
