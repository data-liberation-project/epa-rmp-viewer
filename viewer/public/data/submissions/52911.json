The compression was brought on line in Sept. of 2007. The process was in place.Low pressure inlet gas enters the facility from several pipe lines and is manifoiled in to the 4 Compressor on location, The gas is then compressed up to 350 psig, send throung a TEG water removeal station and then send to a Natural Gas Dewpoint Plant where the gas is cooled and the C-3 plus Hydrocarbons are removed. The Stripped Gas is then Metered and solded to Columbea Gas Transmission. The Liquids stripped from the Natural Gas are sent from the Plant to a 30,000 Storage Tank and loaded on a Truck and sent to Mark West Hydrocarbons in Sialom, Ky. The Facility produces approx. 3000 gals. 15,000 lbs. of Hydrocarbons per day. The Hydrocarbon make up of Liquid is as follows .5% ethane, 6% propane, 8.4% Butanes, 22.6% pentanes and 58% C-6plus.The weight of the total Liquids is 150,000 lbs.

Ethane 5% @ 3.11 lbs. per gal, 4332 lbs., Propane 6% @ 4.224 lbs per gall or 6801lbs, 15% Butanes @ 4.865 lbs per gal. or 20656 lbs., Pentane 22.5% @ 5.2 lbs per gal. or 26,675 lbs., C-6 plus 52.5% @ 5.8 lbs. per gal. or 76,696 lbs.                                                                                    These factors give the total weight of the Liquids 136,168 lbs. This gave the worst case scenario (worst Case assumes the entirecontents were released and formed a vapor cloud which detonated) the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi is 0.4 miles.
