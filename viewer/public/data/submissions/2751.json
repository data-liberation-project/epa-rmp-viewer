      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Mesa Water Treatment Plant (Mesa WTP), one of several facilities owned and operated by the Colorado Springs Utilities (CSU).\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nCSU believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, CSU has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Mesa WTP RMP for the chlorine system.  Correspondingly, CSU has determined to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements although it is eligible for the less comprehensive requirements of Program 2.  By doing so, CSU affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nCSU takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Mesa WTP) and actively participated in comprehensive process hazard analyses.  The system employees are properly trained in the safe operati"

They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nCSU management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Mesa WTP RMP procedures and policies.\nAs for emergency response, CSU has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Mesa WTP is located at 2715 Mesa Road in Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado.  The Mesa WTP is a surface water treatment plant consisting of the following processes:  pre-chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, post-chlorination, and stabilization.  Pre-chlorination uses an initial dose of chlorine to disinfect the incoming water and to maintain a chlorine residual throughout the treatment process.  Post-chlorination is required to boost the chlorine level to maintain disinfection throughout the distribution system.\n\nThe Mesa WTP serves approximately 100,000 people with an average winter flow rate of 15 million gallons per day (MGD) and an average summer rate of 38 MGD.\n\nThe Mesa WTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of drinking water.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of ten containers (20,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Mesa WTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For worst-case release scenario, the"

Therefore, the scrubber is assumed not to work in this scenario.  Worst-case meteorological conditions as specified in the RMP regulation are also assumed to be present.  The release is also assumed to occur outdoors.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the facility reviewed the consequences of the loss of a fusible plug from a full one-ton container during offloading activities.  The incident would occur outdoors so that the scrubber or other active mitigation devices would not be effective.\nResults of the off-site consequence analyses are described in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*Submit plan for the Mesa WTP.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Mesa WTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n7 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n7 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n7 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions\n7 Training for each Mesa WTP employee involved in operating the chlorine system\n7 Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment\n7 Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements in kind\") to the chlorine system\n7 Pre-startup safe"

In the event of a release of chlorine in the storage room, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the chlorine-contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the City of Colorado Springs Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team.

The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Mesa WTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Mesa WTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."
