Drinking water produced at these two facilities exceeds the quality standards set by the USEPA and Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment.  Water treated at these facilities comes from prisine, high mountain lakes and City managed reservoirs. The City of Aurora Wemilnger Water Treatment Plant(Wemlinger) is a direct filtration , drinking water treatment facility.  Wemlinger was built in 1983 with an original treatment capacity of 40 millions gallons per day.  From a subsequent plant expansion, the plant is now able to treat 60 million gallons of drinking water per day.  During the expansion, the faciltiy was updated to met the existing building, fire and construction codes. In addition, operation, instrumentation, and monitioring equipment were updated to enhance treatment.  Overall, Wemlinger produces an exceptional product safely and economically  REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.    Chlorine is used at this faciltiy for disinfection of source waters, Chlorine is handled in 1 ton containers. Containers are housed in a room specifically designed for chlorine handling.  The room is enclosed with a fan mounted at floor level in the case of accidental release.  A chlorine B kit is stationed on the north wall of the room.  Standard operating procedures(SOP) require eight containers to be on-line for disinfection purposes.  The containers are set up in two banks of four containers.  A self contained breathing appratus is mounted outside of the room in case of an accidental release.  SOP for chlorine container delivery, relplacement and return is detailed in the vendor SOP, facility SOP and Safety Manual.  During 2000, the chlorine system will be updated to meet the current applicable codes, USEPA and AWWA regulations.  A chlorine scrubber, which removes chlorine gas from exhaust air, will be installed"

      "SummaryText": ".  Thus, improving treatment and safety operations.  Ammonia feed system was installed in 1988. Ammonia is used to maintain the chlorine residual of finished water in the distribution system.  Ammonia is stored in a bulk 8,600 gallon tank.  A possible release of ammonia would most likely to occur inside  of the plant, thus limiting the possibility of public exposure. SOP for ammonia delivery and handling is detailed in the facility SOP and Safety manual.  In December of 1998, a new ammonia tank which meet current applicable codes, USEPA and AWWA regulations was installed.  This tank is an 8,000 gallon double lined of steel construction. This fully meets current UST regulations.   FACILITY SAFETY  Of utmost importance to the City is the safety of the public, environment and the employees.  In order to maintain safe conditions, the City has developed plans for responsible operations of the plant, emergency response, and routine maintenance.  The accidental release prevention and response policies ae embodied in the Wemlinger Standard Operating Procedures(SOP) and Utilities Department Water Operations Group Safety Manual(Safety Manual).  The Safety Manual is updated every five years.  In addition, Wemlinger has cooperated with local emergency responders to develop emergency response operating procedures.  Training drill have been staged with the Aurora Fire Department. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies and procedures are kept at both facilties.  Policies in these documents have been developed with the cooperation of the City's Risk Management and Fire Protective Department. Employees are trained to respond in the event of an accidental release fo a regulated substance. There has never been an accidental release of chlorine at the Wemlinger plant.  This is attributed to well trained staff and continued preventative maintenance. In the last five years, one accidental ammonia release was reported. The accidental release occurred March 22, 1994."

There were no offsite, nor onsite consequences which resulted in death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, or public evacuation. One person was exposed to the gas, treated by th City medical team, and released.  The circumstances surrounding the release were investigated and corrective actions were performed accordingly.   EMERGENCY RESPONSE  An Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facilty and is coordinated with the City of Aurora Fire Protection Department, Aurora Police Department and the LEPC.  Drills are conducted on a regular basis to keep responders and plant personnel up-to-date on the lastest response strategies."
