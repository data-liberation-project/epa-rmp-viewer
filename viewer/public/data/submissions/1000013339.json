      "SummaryText": "Central Minnesota Ethanol Cooperative (CMEC) is an ethanol fuel production plant located near Little Falls, in Morrison County, Minnesota.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Central Minnesota Ethanol completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site above the RMP reporting threshold.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCMEC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant, as well as the aqueous ammonia.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make it unfit for human consumption.  The aqueous ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of CMEC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant or aqueous ammonia, it is the policy of CMEC to notify the Little Falls Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain up to 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 95,000 pounds (total pentane is 38,000 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  Aqueous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for"

      "SummaryText": " pH control.  The aqueous ammonia used at CMEC contains up to 61 percent ammonium hydroxide.  The maximum ammonia stored will be 41,000 pounds.  CMEC has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios as it relats to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  CMEC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, CMEC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nCMEC does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.  This facility began operations the week of February 26, 1999.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\nCMEC has developed a written Emergency Response Plan, which includes, in part, response measures for chemical releases, an employee training program, and a schedule for periodic drills.  CMEC is also incorporated into the community Emergency Response Plan and coordinates with the Little Falls Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCMEC is in the process of completing a new Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and will update this section as appropriate based upon any planned changes identified by the PHA.
