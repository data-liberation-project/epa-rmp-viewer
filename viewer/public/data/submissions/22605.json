This site is within the Victoria city limits in  Victoria County. The facility has 33 employees.\n\nCentral Power and Light Company is an investor-owned utility supplying electric service to a 44,000-square-mile area of South Texas.  The company's common stock is held by Central and South West Corporation, a registered public holding company headquartered in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nThe facility is a three-unit steam electric power station with a total generation of approximately 480 mw.  It burns natural gas as the primary fuel with fuel oil as the secondary fuel.  Units 4 and 6 are Westinghouse steam turbine generators installed in 1955 and 1968 respectively.  Unit 5 is a General Electric steam turbine generator  installed in 1963.  Steam is provided by three Babcock and Wilcox boilers.\n\nThe following information is part of a complete Risk Management Plan (RMP) that was prepared for the Central Power and Light Company Victoria Power Station.  The information includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical description, five year accidental release history, alternative release scenario and the worst case scenario.  The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community safety, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely scenario would ever occur.  These scenarios are estimates required by the Environmental Protection Agency and are used to illustrate the importance for risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Victoria Power Station has been producing electricity for over 40 years. During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that a"

A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guide (April 1999). It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise. However, the laws of physical science do not allow complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the Victoria Power Station involves a cylinder containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine. The entire quantity is released and vaporizes over a 10 minute period and the resulting vapor cloud travels down wind.  A level of concern to the community extends 1.3 miles down wind. \n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed. These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenario may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Victoria  Power Station involves the failure of a one-fourth inch pigtail or similar connection releasing chlorine over a duration of 60 minutes. The resulting cloud extends 0.1 miles down wind.\n\nCPL's chlorinating systems are built and installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases. Some of the typical safety equipment and systems used at the plant include:\n - Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering"
