The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGillette, AMC has comprehensive training programs in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every two years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGillette, AMC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Gillette, AMC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

For alternative release scenario analyses, we have also employed  Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chose scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Tank Farm in the A-31/152A Storage process.  The scenario involves the release of 136698.36lb. of Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl].  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.41 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the A-46 Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a fireball.  The scenario involves the release of 118897.68 lb. of Propane in ten minutes.  The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures that include deluge system(s) and excess flow valve(s).  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.4 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank Farm in the AB70 Storage.
