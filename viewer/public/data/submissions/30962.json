EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTomah Reserve, inc. is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for the  Reserve Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the  Reserve Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the  Reserve Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at the  Reserve Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Reserve Plant.\n\n\n\n1.2     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nTomah Reserve is committed to the safety of  the  Reserve Plant workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The  Reserve Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to minimize such releases. The  Reserve Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and coordinates with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), which have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\n\n\n1.2     The Reserve Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe   Reserve Plant handles  two (2) substances regulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n\n\n    Ethylene and Propylene Oxide ( EO/PO) are  stored fo"

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). The  Reserve Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Reserve Plant.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Reserve Plant.  Because the  process at the Reserve Plant is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe  Reserve Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the Reserve Plant accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe  Reserve Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\n\n\nThe Reserve Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued on the next page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe  Reserve Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Reserve Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe  Reserve Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes.  \n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the  Reserve Plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each technician, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued on the next page\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Reserve Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Reserve Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Reserve Plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Reserve Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor..\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Reserve Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Reserve Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.
