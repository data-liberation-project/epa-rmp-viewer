      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHelena Chemical Company (Helena) recently acquired an existing Retail Facility located in Wyaconda, MO (Wyaconda Retail).  Helena is submitting this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Wyaconda Retail Facility located 1-mile north of Wyaconda, MO 63474 on Route A.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Wyaconda Retail Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Wyaconda Retail Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena has updated this RMP in response to its? recent acquisition of this existing operation.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Wyaconda Retail Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and consists of approximately one-acre on which 11 nurse tanks and one 30,000-gallon storage tank are located.  Ammonia is transported to this facility via a commercial carrier and transferred to the 30,000-gallon storage tank.  The process operations conducted by Helena personnel consist of transferring ammonia from the storage tank into the nurse tanks.  The ammonia is either (1) sold to local farmers for direct application, or (2) transported by Helena personnel to the Wyaconda Retail Blending Facility for the formulation process.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for "

      "SummaryText": "the ammonia storage process. The worst case scenario release for the Wyaconda Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank (30,000-gallon) were released. The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 1-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (rail guards, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since check valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Fertilizer Manager is responsible for conducting ammonia process operations in accordance with this RMP and is responsible for the relevant maintenance, training procedures and documentation.  Upon request, Helena will provide a copy of its Risk Management Plan, Contingency Plan, and Operating Procedures to its contractors and auditing agency.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Wyaconda Retail Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuri"

The RMP will be updated as the Wyaconda Retail Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Clark County, MO LEPC.\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA?s RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Wyaconda Retail Facility."
