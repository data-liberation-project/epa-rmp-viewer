Dodge, Iowa\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMPlan)\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company (KNC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) are produced and loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane, ethane and hydrogen is found "

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nHydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and urea ammonium nitrate are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  Hydrochloric and nitric acid are below the minimum concentration necessary to be considered an RMP substance.  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, nitric acid must be at a concentration of 80%, or greater; and hydrochloric acid must be at a concentration of 37%, or greater, to be considered an RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate is a mixture that does not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making this product exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that any unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and "

A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility of interrupting the combustion of ammonia vapors in the flare by having a continuous pilot in the flare.  \n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup UPS in place.\n?Installing chlorine detectors at the chlorine use area to help ensure that a chlorine release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n?Installing ?smart hoses? in the loading area that seal off in the event of a hose rupture.\n?Requiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air equipment in the control rooms.\n?Manning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\n?Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n?Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n?Level indications are in place on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n?Providing a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant has had three incidents during the last five years that are reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations:\n\nIn July 2003, an employee was sprayed in the face with an oil/ammonia mixture when a plug blew out of the coupling end of a compressor he was inspecting.  The compressor had been leaking oil and the employee was checking the source of the leak at the time the plug blew out.  The employee was wearing safety glasses, but had trouble catching his breath and his throat and nasal area was sensitive.  Assisted by other employees, the employee flushed his eyes for 45 minutes to one hou"

As a result of this incident, procedures were modified to require that the machine be shut down and depressurized prior to an attempt to tighten the plug.\n\nIn November 2003, a truck driver was loading ammonia when he inadvertently bumped the valve on the outboard end of the hose, which released ammonia vapor in his face and upper chest.  The driver showered off and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  He received medical treatment and was released from the hospital the next day.  As a result of this incident, installation of longer nipples on the ends of all loading lines were installed, alignment adjustments were made to the valves, and valve handle packing glands were tightened as needed.\n\nIn January 2005, ammonia began leaking from a bypass valve packing when the valve was opened.  Several employees unsuccessfully attempted to close the valve, as well as a second bypass valve, to stop the leak.  In the process of trying to stop the leak, two employees received ammonia burns and were taken to the hospital where they were given prescription burn medication.  As a result of this incident, maintenance procedures were revised and the adequacy of personal protective equipment was reviewed.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Ft. Dodge Nitrogen Plant with the Webster County LEPC and the Webster County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be Trinity Regional Hospital, the Iowa Highway Patrol, Cornbelt Power and Northern Natural Gas.  The Ft. Dodge Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with"
