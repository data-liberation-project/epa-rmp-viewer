It is a manned natural gas processing plant. The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 1.

No receptors are present within the distance to the worst-case release endpoint.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Nesson Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\r\n\r\nHazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Nesson Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. This program is conducted in accordance with the OSHA PSM requirements (Process Hazard Analysis - PHA).\r\n\r\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a comprehensive group of engineers, operators, I&E technicians, mechanics, and management. They analyze and evaluate hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they belie"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nNESSON PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nThe Nesson Plant places a strong commitment on worker safety. Nesson Gathering demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nPRCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Nesson Plant, located near Tioga, ND, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, NGL's, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Nesson.  The inlet gas from the field is separated to remove free liquids and then compressed to plant processing pressure. The gas is then dehydrated with a conventional molecular sieve dehydration system to a very low water dew point.  The gas then flows to the mechanical refrigeration facility to remove as much propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier components from the inlet gas to reduce to sales heating value specification.  Condensate from the chiller flows to the deethanizer, where the liquids are purified to NGL product sales specifications. The overhead gas from the deethanizer flows to the recompressor, where the off gas is compressed to the plant residue pipeline.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the Nesson Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank TK-3030 Condensate Storage Tank containing 60,000 gallons (464,000 lbs.).

      "SummaryText": "ve such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Nesson Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training."

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Nesson  Plant conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Nesson management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Nesson Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The plan also covers the sequential steps of addressing a potential fire, spill, tornado, and bomb threat.  The program addresses the responsibilities of each member of the emergency response team and outlines the network of communication to ensure success.
