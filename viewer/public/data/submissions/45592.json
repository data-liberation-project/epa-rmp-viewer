      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  This document meets the requirements for the Aberdeen Proving Ground to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Clean Air Act as Amended 1990 (CAAA-90).  It describes elements of the program, assigns responsibility and tasks for implementation, and communicates clearly APG's commitment to its workers and surrounding community that the risk of releases of chlorine are minimized.\n\n\nFacility Background:\n\nThe APG is located approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore, Maryland and 50 miles south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM), U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School (OC&S), U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC), U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command (RDECOM), U.S. Army Environmental Center (AEC), U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine (USACHPPM), U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD), and major elements of U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL).   The quantity of chlorine stored and used at APG's water treatment plant (WTP) and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) require APG to develop and impleme"

Chlorine is the only chemical that currently exceeds threshold for applicable risk management regulations at APG.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nIn addition to the RMP, APG has a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan and an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  APG's PSM Plan addresses safety in the workplace by identifying related work processes and assuring all safety measures required are followed.   The ICP describes additional procedures and regulations followed by various APG offices in preparation for response to a hazardous materials incident.  The ICP is included in this document by reference.

      "SummaryText": "MP.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe APG Directorate of Safety, Health and Environment's Fire and Emergency Services Division (APG DSHE-FESD) is a comprehensive community and emergency service system.  In addition, DSHE-FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford County Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the DSHE-FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR) 420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation.\n\nPlanned changes:\n\nOver the past several years, a number of accidental release prevention steps have been taken to improve the safety and reliability of the chlorine systems.  The chlorine distribution systems were converted to vacuum systems with controls that will stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a pipe break or similar equipment failure.  Additionally, the amount of on-site chlorine was reduced substantially.  A variety of physical security measures are in place at all facilities, to include patrols by armed security forces to prevent unauthorized access.  APG is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the RMP, and no significant changes to the system are currently planned."
