      "SummaryText": "The Northeast Perishables is a food distribution warehouse that contains refrigerated areas for perishable items.  The refrigerated areas of the warehouse are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available.  However, the properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nThe Northeast Perishables has opted to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 15,000 pounds.\n\nThe Northeast Perishables complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR).  The operators are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release.  An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The worst case scenario considered the loss of the total charge of 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system over a 10-minute period.  The analysis showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 3,696 yards or 11,088 feet.  There are approximately 5,494 residents who could be potentially affected in the identified radius.  There are other public receptors (schools, nursing facility, industrial/commercial buildings, and recreational areas) in the potentially affected area, but"

      "SummaryText": " no environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, considered a release of ammonia from a broken line inside the building.  A release of 1,500 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period was considered.  The computer model showed that the ammonia vapor could travel approximately 316 yards or 948 feet.  There are public receptors (industrial/commercial buildings) in the potentially affected area.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were used to limit the chemical release distances for either scenario.\n\nThe Northeast Perishables has an established Emergency Response Plan to respond to emergencies.  The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 Emergency Response Plan.  The plan requires Fleming associates to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area.  The emergency agencies will be notified of the emergency.  The emergency agencies will notify any potentially affected neighbors.  Fleming maintenance associates will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency.  The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Northeast Perishables wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  A Process Hazard Analysis was completed on the refrigeration system on September 16 - 19, 1996.  Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Accidental Chemical Release Prevention Program.  Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
