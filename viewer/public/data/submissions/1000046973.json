(PSM) facility located in Los Angeles, California (see in Figure 1), has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations:\n\n\n\n?    California Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2775.10, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n?    Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to facilitate the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by providing to the public and regulatory agencies information on regulated substances, a 5-year history of no accidents, potential offsite consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative release scenarios, and condition with local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is hydrofluoric acid (HF, 70 percent by weight).  The facility uses HF to clean and treat the surface of metals that many also be subject to the following onsite processes:\n\n\n\n?    Rolling\n\n?    Annealing\n\n?    Slitting\n\n?    Tempering\n\n\n\nPSM also stores and utilizes drums of 67% nitric acid (HNO3) at the facility.  The partial pressure of 67% HNO3 is less than 10 mmHg at temperatures below approximately 114 oF.  Consequently, nitric acid stored or used at the facility is not subject to the CalARP reporting requirements.  Figure 2 provides a summary of the partial pressures for nitric acid at varying concentrations and temperatures.  In addition, the 67% HNO3 is not subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements because the concentration is below the 80% threshold.  A summary of acid quantities and RMP thresholds at PSM is provided in Table 1.  In consideration of the Federal RMP and CalARP thresholds and exclusions, hydrofluoric acid is subject to reporting and the subsequent provisions of the r"
