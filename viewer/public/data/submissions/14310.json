This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and maintenance of our gas processing facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Gas Plant located near 19590 7th Standard Rd in McKittrick , California compresses , distills, and dehydrates natural gas products from oil and gas wells at Aera Energy's Belridge production field. This marketable products produced at the Belridge gas plant are mixed butane, natural gasoline, and propane. The plant intermittently loads these products through a loading rack into MC 331 tanker transports. The mixed butane and propane are flammable gases liquefied under pressure. Natural gasoline is a flammable liquid. Current regulated substances are mixed butane and natural gasoline.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the Belridge gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank mixed butane.  The release amount would be 220,000 pounds, which is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.49 miles. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS)"

The flammable cloud may travel up to 220 feet in typical weather conditions before dispersing below the flammable concentration.  This scenario is unlikely to occur because of the controls provided on loading trucks/transports. Each driver and vehicle are identified in the computer which has maximum fill levels for each vehicle, and drivers must be trained in facility procedures. Guard rails are provided to protect the loading rack from external impact. The truck driver attends the loading and is not permitted into the truck cab during loading. Emergency shutdown buttons are provided at the loading rack for use in an emergency, which closes the loading valves, pumps, and storage tanks. UV flame detection is also provided at the loading rack which will shut off loading pumps and valves if a flame is detected..\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Because processes at the Storage facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation , they are also subject to Cal/OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention plan.\n\n\nManagement System for RMP and PSM\n\nAera Belridge gas plant has developed a management system in order to define all elements required by the process safety standard and risk management program. The management system defines for each program element the following:\n1. Purpose and scope of element\n2. Specific procedures\n3. Responsible and accountable personnel using a RACI (responsible, accountable,consult,inform) chart, \n4. Verification an"

Document locations for applicable documents\n\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Belridge Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as a part of the Belridge gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition,  Aera Belridge gas plant utilizes behavior based safety management (BBSM), an employee directed process to observe and review operations to assure safe behaviors are maintained and unsafe behaviors are corrected with peer feedback and corrective action plans.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Belridge gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific personnel within the facilities are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the management system.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).

For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. pressure, tank levels, temperature) in a key process parameter document. The facility ensures that process is maintained within these limits using process controls, and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBelridge gas plant PSM facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nAera's Belridge gas plant primarily use the What-if process hazard analysis technique and the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA teams findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.

All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from original design safety features, the facilities periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Belridge gas plant maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera's facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures "

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance, inspection and construction activities. Because some of the contractors work on or near process equipment, Aera's facilities have procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they may find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with  (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor and audit contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations through the internal safety and environmental auditing (ISEA) process.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews(PSSR's)\n\n The Belridge gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for start up prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the constructi"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a process that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel involved in maintenance activities receive training on (1) a overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a significant deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Aera Belridge gas plant operations incorporate quality assurance measures into the equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAera's safe wor"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidation.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Aera periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to local management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Belridge Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at Aera Belridge Operating Area. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Belridge Gas Plant has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly d"

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a energy control  procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAera has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAera promptly investigates all incidents, which results in or could have reasonably resulted in a major accident, which also includes near misses.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify causal factors and root causes, then develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Aera uses the Taprootb root cause methodology for this level of incident investigation. The investigation team documents its findings, "
