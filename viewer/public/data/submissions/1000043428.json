The Health and Safety Code uses the term \"accident risk\" to broaden the definition of accidents to include potential accidents or near misses.  The definition for accident is as follows: \n\n\n\n\"... a potential for the release of an AHM into the environment which could produce a significant likelihood that persons exposed may suffer acute health effects resulting in significant injury or death.\"\n\n\n\nSince the ammonia refrigeration facility at the Stockton site was constructed in 1990, there have been no accidents involving AHM.  As a corporation, Exel, Inc. owns and operates other ammonia refrigeration facilities.  Although not required by the RMP, accident data at these other facilities was reviewed.  This review determined that there were no ammonia-related accidents at any of Exel, Inc. currently owned or operated ammonia refrigeration facilities. \n\n\n\nDepending on the specific type of industry or process being evaluated, the definition of \"accident\" can vary significantly.  For instance, while the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) refers to \"accidents\" as incidents that involve worker injury, and does not specifically relate to release of hazardous material, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title lll defines specific federal reporting requirements for releases of hazardous material.  The SARA standards establish chemical-specific criteria for reporting releases based on the quantity of material released over a specified duration.  For example, any release of ammonia that exceeds 100 pounds in 24 hours must be reported under SARA Title lll requirements.  Unlike the OSHA standard, the SARA reporting requirements are independent of worker injury. \n\n\n\nThere have been no such accidents at any of the Exel, "

In addition to not having any ammonia accidents as defined by the California Health and Safety Code, there were also no releases of ammonia in the past three years which exceeded the 100 pounds/24 hour release repeatability threshold required by federal reporting guidelines (SARA Title lll).\n\n\n\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION (Anhydrous Ammonia System)\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the chemical used in the refrigeration system in this facility.  Refrigeration systems of this type are the most widely used in the world, primarily due to their reliability, safety and cost.  These systems are inherently safe and are designed and installed with automatic, computer-controlled monitoring systems to both indicate necessary maintenance procedures and sound the alarm in case of accident.  Ammonia is a lighter-than-air gas at atmospheric pressure and temperature and would rise quickly and disperse if released into the environment.  The primary hazard associated with ammonia is acute toxicity when inhaled or ingested. Ammonia also poses a hazard when coming into contact with the skin.\n\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF AMMONIA REFRIGERATION\n\n\"Refrigeration\" is a general term used to describe the cooling of a space or substance to a temperature below the ambient temperature.  Mechanical refrigeration is an application of thermodynamics wherein a cooling medium, or \"refrigerant,\" goes through a sequence of phase changes, the net effect of which is to absorb heat from one location and transfer it to another.  This process occurs in a closed cycle so that the refrigerant is recycled.  In the Exel, Inc. facility at the Stockton site, ammonia is the refrigerant.  In the ammonia refrigeration cycle, liquid ammonia expands, absorbs heat from the surroundings, ammonia vapor is compressed, condensed to a liquid, and then expanded.  As it expands, ammonia liquid changes back to vapor and absorbs heat from its surroundings, thereby providing refrigeration.  Aft"

Until the early 1980s, CFCs and HCFCs were the most commonly used refrigerants.  These substances, however, have been demonstrated to have ozone-depleting properties and high global warming potential, thus posing a long-term danger to the environment and possible health risks.  Substances such as propane, butane, ethane, and ethylene can also be used as refrigerants, but when mixed with air, these substances are highly flammable and explosive. Therefore, they pose a significant risk to workers and the community. \n\n\n\nAmmonia is one of several available refrigerants not in either of these problematic groups, and has been used in refrigeration applications for more than 100 years. \n\n\n\nMost larger industrial systems rely on ammonia as a refrigerant.  Ammonia was chosen as the at the Exel, Inc. Stockton site for many of the same reasons it has been selected by other manufacturers:\n\n\n\n     1. Ammonia is a highly efficient refrigerant.\n\n     2. Ammonia does not have any ozone depletion potential.\n\n     3. Ammonia does not have any global warming potential. \n\n     4. Although ammonia, like several other refrigerants, has toxic properties, it\n\n          has many advantages over other refrigerants in terms of worker and \n\n          community safety:\n\n \n\nAmmonia is easily detected by smell in concentrations well below levels that could be harmful. \n\nAmmonia gas is lighter than air and will rise and disperse into the atmosphere if released.  \n\nAmmonia has a high affinity for absorption in water.

This is accomplished through the use of design features that provide automatic system shutdown if critical parameters are beyond the normal operating conditions, local as well as remote monitoring of system operation, and numerous system controls and interlocks that alert the operator of any problems and enable the operator to shut the system down if necessary. \n\n\n\nFor example, one unique accident prevention feature inherent in the Exel, Inc. ammonia refrigeration facility is that very little human interaction is required.  The refrigeration process involves recirculation of ammonia and, other than periodic system monitoring, there is virtually no need for operator involvement in the normal operation of the system, thus reducing potential risk of human error. \n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event that a problem occurs that results in release of ammonia from the refrigeration system, a sophisticated ammonia detection system located throughout the ammonia refrigeration facility will sense the presence of ammonia, provide an audible alarm, and initiate safety systems and system shutdown if required.\n\n\n\nAMMONIA LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM AND REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AUTOMATIC CONTROLS \n\n\n\nOne of the single most important properties of ammonia from a safety perspective is its strong, pungent odor. Ammonia can be sensed by the human nose in concentrations as low 50 parts per million (ppm) in air. This odor threshold concentration of ammonia is well below the levels that pose a health hazard. Therefore, the odor of ammonia provides an early warning signal that allows people to evacuate contaminated areas and take protective actions long before significant hazards exist. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Exel, Inc.' ammonia refrigeration facility includes a sophisticated ammonia leak detection system that automatically initiates safety systems as well as local and site alarms.

For example, it would not be appropriate to evacuate the site for a small ammonia leak that would not be harmful.  Likewise, large leaks would require a greater level of response and initiation of precautionary actions.  For this reason, the ammonia detection system will have different responses for varying levels of detected ammonia concentration.  These responses will initiate a local alarm at 250 ppm.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the automatic controls associated with the ammonia leak sensing system, there will also be automatic controls associated with operation of the refrigeration compressors.  Each of the compressor units is controlled by a microprocessor.  Among its other functions, the microprocessor operates a series of interlocks which, in the event that pre-established critical parameters are exceeded, shut down the compressor.  As an additional safeguard, auxiliary system controls also exist to shut off the compressors if certain critical parameters for auxiliary equipment are exceeded. \n\n\n\nAMMONIA REFRIGERATION FACILITY OPERATING PARAMETER MONITORING.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Leak Detection System Automatic Controls\n\nAMMONIA CONCENTRATION (Parts per million - ppm).

Administrative Operating Control\n\nOperation of the ammonia refrigeration facility is a straightforward process that requires very little operator interaction.  The system functions as a closed recirculating loop.  The operators perform system inspections, maintenance activities, and periodic testing of components.  The following controls have been incorporated into the standard operating procedures that apply to the Stockton site:\n\n\n\nOperating procedures for the system are available in writing, in an easily followed format. \n\nThe procedures include directions for system startup, shutdown, interruptions, and emergency situations.  There also is a written emergency evacuation procedure and equipment lockout/tagout procedure. \n\nMechanisms are in place to ensure operating procedures, Piping and Instrumentation Drawings (P&IDs), and equipment, instrumentation and piping inspection lists are kept up to date. \n\nOperating personnel have trained in system startup, shut down, troubleshooting and emergencies. \n\nA control room walkdown has been performed to verify operating procedures are accessible to operators for reference. \n\nProvisions are in place to have supervisory personnel check on operators on a regular basis. \n\nDelivery of ammonia will be required to initially \"charge\" the addition to the refrigeration system.  Also, in the future, it will be necessary to recharge (replacing only a portion of the charge) the refrigeration system with ammonia, similar to the recharging of an automobile air conditioner.  It is estimated from past experience that the system may need to be done every 2-3 years. \n\nFor the initial charge, or when a recharge is necessary, ammonia will be delivered to the facility by a certified vendor using a bulk storage tank truck.  These trucks are certified for safety by the Department of Transportation.  Some of their required key features include the following: \n\nFlexible charging line suitable for use with ammonia. \n"
