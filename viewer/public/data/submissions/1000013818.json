Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Ciba Corporation transferred to  BASF Corporation and  BASF Corporation became the owner and operator of the BASF Corporation West Memphis Site.  \n\n1.0) Introduction:\n\nRisk Management Plan (RMP)  \nExecutive Summary - April 2010\n\nBASF Corporation \nWest Memphis, AR.\n\n1.0) Introduction:\n\n1.1) Site History \n\nBASF Corporation, West Memphis, Arkansas manufacturing facility is located at the junction of interstate highway I-55 and the Mississippi river.  The site is approximately 150 acres in size and was originally an Army Corp of Engineers barge repair facility during the 1930's.  During the 1970's the site manufactured agricultural chemicals for Chemform, Inc. In 1981, CPS Chemical Co. acquired the site and originally had 10 employees.  The site grew to 240 employees by 1997 when CPS was purchased by Allied Colloids.  Ciba Specialty Chemical Co. acquired the site in 1998 with the purchase of Allied Colloids.The site was used by CPS and later Allied Colloids and Ciba Corporation and now BASF Corporation for the production of water treatment chemicals.   \n\n1.2) BASF Corporation's Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies \n\nBASF has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) composed of experienced chemical operators and shift supervisors who are trained to respond to an accidental release, fire, spill, or other emergency at the West Memphis site. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) training requirements, all employees receive Awareness Level training. Chemical operators receive Technician Level training and shift supervisors receive Incident Command Level training. The site ERT operates under the same Incident Command Structure as the West Memphis Fire De"

Both of these products are produced as solutions in water.  These monomers and polymers are used in water treatment applications, for removing color and solids from drinking water, and in paper making \n\n\nProduction area P2 produces the methacrylate monomer FM1 and the quaternary monomer salts of both FM1 and the acrylate monomer FA1.  Also produced here are DADMAC polymers made from P1 produced monomer.  The quaternary salts and polymers are all made and sold as solutions in water.  FM1 and FA1 quats are used in co-polymer applications for water treatment, in coatings, and as lube-oil additives\n\nProduced in P3 are glycidyl ethers and their intermediates.

Recommended practices are designed both to prevent accidents from occurring and to effectively respond if an incident or accident does occur. BASF has a specific course of action and procedures in place to address the PSM and RMP  Requirements. These include:\n  \nSpecific Chemical information is contained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Information regarding toxicity, reactivity, physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing is developed for all covered processes. Information regarding process chemistry, block-flow diagrams, safe upper and lower operating limits for process parameters, and consequences of deviations are included in the standard operating procedures (SOP's). \n\nThe Maintenance Department maintains fabrication data for all process plant equipment and tracks equipment repair history to ensure ongoing equipment reliability. A preventative maintenance program requires periodic inspection and testing of all vessels, protective equipment, and interlocks on processes containing hazardous materials.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted on each PSM and RMP covered process.

Planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices, and ongoing personnel training are an integral part of and considered necessary to support a continuous improvement in facility safety. Periodic reviews of the management systems and rigorous internal audits ensure continuing compliance. \n\nThe management system provides the required and necessary information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility. This information is available to all employees and can be made readily available to emergency responders and the community. \n\nRisk Management Planning (RMP) and the integrated risk management program at BASF'sA?s West Memphis Site help to ensure operations that are safe today, and will be even safer tomorrow by providing methods to continue to identify and address potential risks to employees and the community.\n\n8.0)  Conclusion - RMP Data Elements\n\nEach facility covered by the RMP Rule must submit one Risk Management Plan (RMP) that covers all its RMP regulated processes. The plan will be submitted electronically to the EPA and will follow the format provided by the RMP Data Elements Guidance Document published by the EPA on June 20, 1996.  The BASF West Memphis Accident Prevention Program is adopted directly from OSHAA?s PSM Standard compliance program which is consistent with EPA's Level 3 RMP Program requirements under 40 CFR part 68.
