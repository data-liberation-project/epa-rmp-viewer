      "SummaryText": "1.1  Introduction \r\nCalpine Corporation operates the Delta Energy Center (DEC), a nominal 880-megawatt power plant located in Pittsburg, California.  The DEC uses anhydrous ammonia as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safe operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nDEC's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Calpine Corporation that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place in which to work and live. Calpine Operations and Maintenance Department incorporates the concepts of environmental responsibility and productivity with safety resulting in efficiency and productivity.  As part of Calpine's obligation to protect the integrity of human, environmental, physical, and financial resources, and to conserve and\r\nefficiently utilize those resources, Calpine will: \r\n\u00b7\tComply fully with laws regulating environmental protection and employee health and safety\r\n\u00b7\tFurnish work places free of recognized hazards likely to cause injury to employees, the public, or the environment\r\n\u00b7\tTrain employees in safe and environmentally conscious practices and require compliance with envir"

This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.

The site is located in the city limits of Pittsburg in Contra Costa County at the border of the City of Antioch, and is approximately 35 miles northeast of San Francisco. \r\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 15,000-gallon double walled steel storage tank at 85% capacity, which is located inside a secondary containment area.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at DEC to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the three  Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) duct burners.  Anhydrous ammonia  vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the three Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. \r\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at DEC exceeds the federal RMP (and PSM) and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP, PSM and CalARP regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \r\nManagement System\r\nRisk Management Program regulations require those facilities with processes subject to Program 3 to develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  The management system must be assigned to a qualified person or position that will have the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.  \r\nDEC has assigned the Operations Manager as the qualified person who will have the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP.

The EHS Manager is responsible for arranging for and tracking training of staff.\r\nControlling - The EHS Manager is responsible for conducting the internal compliance audits of the prevention program to ensure the procedures are being implemented by staff.  Unless otherwise indicated, RMP records are maintained for five years. \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe prevention program elements described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.  The program elements such as process hazard analysis, compliance audits, and incident investigation result in the development of additional safeguards.  Some of the physical safeguards that are part of the original design and are already in place include the following:\r\nAmmonia Storage Tank.  The storage tank is provided with local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume).  The tank also has pressure safety valves,  temperature gauges, and anhydrous ammonia  leak detectors. Indication and alarms for tank level, temperature, and pressure are displayed on the local control panel and Control Room DCS.  An ammonia vaporizer alarm is also provided in the Control Room DCS.\r\nSecondary Containment. The ammonia  storage tank and vaporizers are located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain the full contents of the vessel, 24 hours of rain fall as determined by the 25-year storm and deluge water for 20 minutes as determined by code.\r\nLe"

Two leak detectors are located beside the vaporizers and one leak detector is inserted into the PRV line.  A leak detector also is located by the unloading station. \r\nThe detectors trigger a local alarm and DCS alarm when a concentration of 50 ppm of ammonia is detected in the air.  If a concentration of 100 ppm is detected, the leak detection system alarms to the Pittsburg Fire Department. There is no automatic function provided with the leak detectors.  Subsequent measures from this high alarm activation will rely on the operator action.\r\nThe underground portion of the piping has secondary containment/single-walled pipe.   \r\nAlarm System.  A common trouble alarm is provided both to the main control panel and DCS on any of the following conditions:\r\n\u00b7\tLow storage tank level - the storage tank low pressure alarm indicating that the vaporizer system has malfunctioned is provided in the DCS .  The alarm also is used to indicate that the storage tank needs to be refilled.\r\n\u00b7\tHigh storage tank level - the storage tank high pressure alarm indicating that that the vaporizer system has malfunctioned, or an excessive high ambient temperature is provided in the Main control and DCS. The alarm also indicates when the anhydrous ammonia unloading should stop. \r\n\u00b7\tLeakage of ammonia from the inner shell of the storage tank - In the event of leak detection by the pressure switch installed in the annular space, an alarm indicating high pressure in the annular space is annunciated in the DCS. \r\n\u00b7\tLeakage from the hose during unloading - in the event of leakage from the hose(s) during unloading an operator shall use the \"emergency button\" on the unloading panel or the remote \"emergency button\" on the west side of the STG building wall to close the unloading valves.

The system will be manually activated locally at the anhydrous ammonia  tank or from the Control Room in the event of an anhydrous ammonia leakage.  The deluge system is not automatically activated because in the event of a large quantity of liquid anhydrous ammonia , adding water can cause a violent reaction and accelerate the release of ammonia  vapor.\r\nFire Safe Stop Valve.
