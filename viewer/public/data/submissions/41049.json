Borden has a very good relation with local responders and other local response groups, for example the Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association.  \n\n6.0 Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe Louisville plant is driven by the corporate philosophy of demonstrating continuous improvement in all aspects of its business.  Promotion of a greater awareness of safety, environmental and housekeeping performance is underway at the facility.  In addition, organizational changes have been made to change the culture in the plant to further increase commitment to performance by plant supervision and technicians.  The business has committed a significant level of resources to leadership development, improved communication, and improvement in teamwork and business processes.  \n\nAnnually the plant develops continuous improvement programs related to safety and environmental performance.  When evaluating capital projects for approval the company places high priority on those projects that minimize safety and environmental risk.  \n\nPreviously, the Louisville site has implemented project to upgrade the safety automation on several reactors.

To accomplish this goal we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nBorden Chemical, Inc. has established a company-wide Safety Manual. This manual establishes requirements and guidelines that have been developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases. The Safety Policy Statement, which is maintained in the Safety Manual, clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  Safety is given the highest priority in emergency response situations. \n\nBorden Chemical participates with other phenolic resin and formaldehyde manufacturers to investigate major incidents, evaluate process safety risks, and to develop process improvement plans. Recommendations for changes resulting from these collaborative efforts are distributed throughout the company, and schedules to upgrade critical safety systems are established where appropriate.\n\nThe Louisville facility has developed a thorough site wide safety program, including an integrated contingency plan that is carefully coordinated with the local emergency response management agencies. Safety programs are administered by qualified professional staff, but emphasize employee involvement. Facility personnel have developed close associations with local emergency response agencies to facilitate an effective and coordinated response in the event of an actual emergency. \n\n2.0 Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility produces formaldehyde solutions and phenol-formaldehyde and related resins using methanol, f"

Borden also grinds phenolic resin into a powdered finished product.  \n\nThe formaldehyde plant is comprised of two operating units and multiple storage tanks.  While much of the formaldehyde is sold as a raw material to customers, a significant amount is used on site to produce phenolic resin.   Virtually all of the formaldehyde is handled in closed piping systems; process equipment is hard piped to weigh tanks and reactors. Formaldehyde is pumped from storage tanks directly to rail cars and tank trucks.  \n\nTwo general types of phenolic resins are produced at the site, including resole (liquid) and novalac (solid) resins.  Most of the finished product resins produced at the facility are non-hazardous.  Handling the raw materials safely and carrying out reactions in the safest manner are keys to good process safety performance.\n\n3.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Louisville plant has a comprehensive process safety management program pursuant to the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place at the facility which includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, and a documentation system to maintain records of compliance. \n\nA site Leadership Team meets weekly, a portion of the meeting is dedicated to discussing relevant safety issues and to verify that all tasks are being completed on schedule. An associate safety team, which is comprised of first line supervisors, technicians and operators, also meets monthly and is responsible for improving safety performance in the plant. The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the safety program at this site.\n\nThe Louisville site has implemented a Process S"

Process hazard analyses are conducted prior to startup of major project installations, and then on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. Significant investment has been made in process control systems as a result of initial process hazard reviews.  \n\nTwo methods are used to ensure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, and processes do not cause accidents.  A Management of Change worksheet is used to initiate a safety review for equipment and process changes.  This review includes a process hazard analysis where appropriate.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a process engineer, and production management.  Supplemental training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made. \n\nThe site has a documented preventive maintenance program to insure the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  This program is managed using a computer database. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed and documented when complete.  The schedule is based on plant experience and manufacturer guidelines to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices that prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measures for performing hot work in the plant; one example is welding; the procedure includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  This procedure reduces the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release in addition to providing protection to maintenance personnel.\n\nPlant supervision and safety professionals"

The objective of this training is to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.  Major incidents are investigated using a formal root cause evaluation process.  \n\nBorden Chemical periodically conducts assessments of its safety and environmental programs using company personnel from the site and other locations, in addition to its comprehensive third party safety and environmental auditing program.  Addressing recommendations from these audits helps to keep the safety and environmental programs up to date and effective.\n\nBorden has actively participated in community outreach programs that have been established in the Rubbertown area to provide a forum for discussing the concerns of our neighbors.  Borden regularly participates on a local Community Advisory Council and neighborhood association.  Associates of the plant have actively sought out opportunities to meet with interested school and community groups to discuss our RMP program.  Borden maintains an open-door policy to encourage constructive dialogue between the company, its near neighbors and other interested members of the public.\n\n4.0 Five-year accident history\n\nBorden has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years, no accidental releases of RMP regulated substances from covered processes have resulted in on-site or off-site impacts, injuries or deaths.  \n\n5.0 Emergency response program\n\nBorden's on-site emergency response team is trained to meet or exceed the training requirements for hazardous materials technicians and incident commanders.
