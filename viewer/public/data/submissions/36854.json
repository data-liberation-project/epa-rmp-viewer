LUCIE WEST SERVICES DISTRICT\n\nWATER & WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nThe intent of the Executive Summary of the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) is to provide complete and accurate information concerning the St. Lucie West Services District Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants to the community.  This document will be available to the public and shall include information pertaining to the following:\n\n\n\n* Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n* Hazard Assessment\n\n* Prevention Program\n\n* Emergency Response Action Plan\n\n\n\nWater and Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n\n\nThe Plants utilize chlorine gas to provide disinfection of the potable water and wastewater effluent being discharged from the facility.  The chlorine gas is stored in one-ton cylinders of chlorine, which are fabricated to FDOT standards (106A500X).  The average container has a capacity of one short ton (2000 pounds), an outer diameter of 30 inches and an overall length of 82 inches.  The heads of each end of the cylinders are convex inward and forge welded to the barrel of the cylinder.  The sides are crimped inward at each end to provide a grip point for lifting beams.\n\n\n\nAll one-ton cylinders are equipped with six fusible metal plugs, three on each end.  The fusible plugs serve as overpressure relief devices.  The fusible metal is designed to melt between 158? and 165?F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or overheating.  The ton-container is designed for a maximum hydrostatic pressure of 500 psig.\n\n\n\nAt the water treatment plant the cylinders are stored outdoors in a three-sided building that provides ventilation and keeps the cylinders above the natural grade of the site.  At the wastewater plant the cylinders are stored in an enclosed room.  Two operational chlorine ton-cylinders connected to the system are each stored on a ton-cylinder scale.  The two chlorine cylinders are connected together via autom"

Additional, inactive, back-up cylinders are store in the area.\n\n\n\nThe scales are provided with trunnions to allow the chlorine ton-cylinders to be rotated to position the internal standpipe to be at the top of the cylinder which will assure gas collection (rather than liquid if stand pipe were positioned down).  Also, in case of a leak, the ton-cylinder can be rotated so that the chlorine escapes as a gas rather than a liquid.\n\n\n\nThe Chlorination system at both plants is used for disinfection purposes.  Chlorine is fed from the ton-cylinders through a device called a \"chlorinator\".  The chlorinator system includes a vacuum regulator check unit that mounts directly to the upper gas valve of the ton-cylinder by means of a lead gasketed positive yoke assembly, and an ejector.  The feed system from the container to chlorination and the ejector is opened under a vacuum, so any leaks pull air into the system instead of releasing chlorine.  Two chlorinators are housed in each chlorination room.  The chlorinators are 500 lb/day units that meter chlorine gas flow. \n\n\n\nThe chlorinator is equipped with a small 25 watt heating element.  Therefore, as chlorine is drawn into the chlorinator from the ton-cylinder, it is deflected into a drip-leg where any liquid chlorine is vaporized, permitting only gas to enter the regulating portion of the chlorinator.  A vent/relief valve is provided with the chlorination unit to vent chlorine gas to the atmosphere at a remote location. \n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Assessment was performed in compliance with the requirements of the EPA standards.  The Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) of worst-case and alternate-case releases of chlorine were estimated, and a five-year accident history was evaluated.  The OCA assessment includes dispersion models, identification of the area that is above the toxi"

The RMP* CompTM model was supplied by the EPA, and it takes into account variances in wind speed, temperature, humidity, surface roughness (urban or rural setting), and release rate.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the worst-case release scenario of chlorine was performed utilizing the parameters provided in 40 CFR 68.22.  The worst-case scenario selected for the WWTP's off-site consequence analysis is the release of the contents of an entire one-ton chlorine cylinder from the chlorination process in a period of 10 minutes.  This yields a release rate of 200 lbs/min.  The radius of influence in this worst-case scenario was determined by the RMP* CompTM model to be 1.9 miles.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.22, the population within the area of influence was determined, and other public and environmental receptors were identified.  The population was based on census track data obtained using the Landview program.  The information regarding public receptors was gathered using a combination of street maps and USGS maps.  The information gathered is presented in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

This model assumed a release rate of 10.5 lbs/min for a duration of 60 minutes.  The distance to the chlorine toxic end point was determined by the RMP* CompTM model to be less than 0.1 mile. \n\n\n\nWithin this area of influence, there are less than 100 residents and no other receptors.

Programs have been developed for standard operating procedures, process safety training, and process technology for employees at all levels.  The programs are in accordance with both OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Prevention Program 3. \n\n\n\nThe St. Lucie West Services District developed and implemented a training program that is in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  Within the first week, all new employees, who work with or are exposed to chlorine are given orientation safety training.  The Utility Director will review with each employee, upon initial assignment, parts of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that he or she must know to protect him/herself in an emergency.  Contractors and visitors will be briefed on the EAP and actions they must take in an emergency as well. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the EAP orientation, each employee is trained in the standard operating procedures for the smooth operation of the Plants.  This program is developed to train the employee in basic operation procedures such as initial startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdowns.  It is also intended to prepare employees for minor troubleshooting.\n\n\n\nAs a policy, employees are tested to ensure they have retained the training and process safety information.  Refresher courses are periodically required to maintain the smooth operation at the St. Lucie West Services District Utility System Facility.\n\n\n\nA copy of the Process Safety Management Program is located at the Facility for easy access and quick reference by all employees. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe St. Lucie West Services District is committed to the saf"

The St. Lucie West Services District coordinates with the local emergency responders such as HAZMAT, Fire and Police Departments to implement an Emergency Response Program.  The Program is set up in accordance with the provisions of 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n\n\nThe Utility site is included in the community emergency response plan.  In the event of a major chlorine release, the facility operating procedure is to evacuate the site upwind of the release and call the St. Lucie County Fire Department station 14 (HAZMAT) at 772-785-5824 or 911 to report the incident.  They will coordinate and handle any first-aid and evacuation/sheltering-in-place as necessary.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a minor leak, the operators will wear a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and attempt to seal the leak.  Standard procedure is for one operator to fix the leak while a second operator observes from a distance to provide back up.  Both operators will be wearing SCBA's.\n\n\n\nThis information supplements \"St. Lucie West Services District Emergency Action and Management Plan Document\" and is kept at the Water Treatment Plant for quick reference.\n\n\n\nThe St. Lucie West Services District strictly adheres to the OSHA and EPA standards, relating to the Emergency Planning and Response.  The water and wastewater treatment facilities employees will be trained in an overview of the emergency action and response plan to assure that he/she knows what action to take in an emergency and can perform the tasks safely and in accordance with the outlined plans. \n\nSt. Lucie West Services District - WWTP Executive Summary    3\n\n\n\n"
