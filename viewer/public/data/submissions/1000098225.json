This commitment to safety is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including, but not limited to Powered Industrial Truck and Spill Response training. An employee safety committee has been established and performs routine checks. Safety is also a topic that is discussed at daily shift start-up meetings. Lawson Products, Inc. maintains a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) listing in the warehouse for use by facility employees. Annual fire safety inspections are performed by Shambaugh & Son, L.P. In addition, Lawson Products, Inc. coordinates emergency response measures with the McCook Fire Department. Lawson Products contracts CNA Insurance for Risk Assessment and underwriting. At least annually, CNA audits the facility with a team of engineers for the main purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events. Lawson Products utilizes the following: Emergency Response Plan (ERP), Hazardous Communication Program and Process Safety Management (PSM).\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled (Facility Description)\n\nLawson Products, Inc. is an industrial distributor of maintenance and repair supplies, distributing products from our 300,000 square-foot facility in McCook, Illinois. The McCook distribution center consists of administration offices, warehouse storage, and shipping areas. The facility warehouses and distributes approximately 300,000 products under different brand names, some of which are regulated chemical aerosol products. The McCook distribution center operates 5 days a week, 21 hours per day, and employs 150 people.\n\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol products. Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks. The individual containers are pack"

The palletized loads are stored within an isolated NFPA aerosol cage with ESFR fire protection. There is a 24/7 security system and a 24/7 fire monitoring system monitoring the facility for a potential event. Security personnel are present at all times on days of operation.\n\n\n\nSome aerosol products stored in the McCook facility contain blends of flammable propellants, which are regulated under the RMP Rule if handled, manufactured or stored in a process at a facility in a quantity greater than its listed threshold quantity. The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. The warehouse facility constitutes a single process. The warehouse stores greater than 10,000 pounds of butane and propane in aerosol products. \n\n\n\nThe aerosol products are typically in metal containers, with the maximum size of 24-ounces. The average weight of these aerosol products is 17.28 oz and the average amount of propellant in each can is 14%. Per EPA Helpline, the worst case scenario was clarified as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single aerosol can.  The worst case scenario was based on an event consisting of one 18 oz aerosol can containing 15% of propane and 15% of butane. The quantity released in a vapor cloud explosion would not affect any residential population or public receptor or have any off-site consequences. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \n\n\n\nLawson's McCook facility is subject to OSHA's PSM rule. Lawson Products, Inc. is an ISO 9001:2015 certified company, and internal and external audits are performed regularly.\n\n\n\nLawson products, Inc. has developed programs to comply with the required environmental, health and safety standards.

These include an early suppression, fast response sprinkler system (ESFR) installed throughout the warehouse, to be used in the event of a fire. Aerosol storage racks are equipped with in-rack sprinkler systems and enclosed in the aerosol cage. All of our forklift operators are trained and certified. Water is pumped through the system via an on-site fire pump. The ESFR system is connected to the public water supply system. Our fire pump and sprinkler systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history \n\n\n\nLawson's McCook facility has no history of accidental releases.
