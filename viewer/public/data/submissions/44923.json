              "Description": "Best Brands is a Bakery/Cold storage facility. This facility falls under the NAICS code 424420. Our safety information was last reviewed and updated April 13, 2005 (Safety meetings are conducted every month). We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards. These standards, and all applicable OSHA standards have been implemented here through written manuals by Environmental Services Group, Inc. The most recent hazard review and update conducted at this facility was April 13, 2005, and corrections/recommendations should be completed by March 30, 2006. The main hazard identified during this hazard analysis was the necessity of additional monitoring devices for identification/detection of releases in all areas where a release could occur. To prevent /limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual valve shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power backup, and grounding equipment. Operating and training procedures were reviewed and revised on April 13, 2005. The employees of Best Brands are trained in the classroom and by on-the -job training. This training is completed with competency test including demonstration, and observation. The maintenance procedures are reviewed by operators on a regularly basis to ensure proper operation of the refrigeration system. The last time they were reviewed and written out was in April 13, 2005 after the system was updated. Best Brands contracted Environmental Services,Group, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.",

The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold \nstorage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in \nhandling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing \nthe threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby \nmembers of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our \ndaily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and \nregulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia \ncombined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling \nprocedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \nGroup, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of Dallas \nCounty Emergency Planning Commission, 911 System for 911 call-out to affected responding agencies, the Dallas \nFire Department, then the notification of John Yingling Corporate Engineer/Safety Director @ 214-837-1450 \n(24 Hours) of Best Brands, the Dallas Fire Department and Dallas Police \nDepartment will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing \nvehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Dallas\nCounty LEPC.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to cool and/or freeze storage compartments by utilizing \nanhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in storage vessels located in the Compressor room \nof the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  \nThe system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized \nmanagement personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 10741 Miller Road location is anhydrous ammonia.  \nThe maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 48,000 pounds.  \nThis amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount \nallowed would release 48,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from the 10741 Miller Road \nPassive mitigation was considered for this scenario. It is assumed that the entire contents are \nreleased as vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 1.9 \nmiles.  This location is classified as urban due to the amounts of obstructions around the \nsite.\n\nAn alternative scenario was determined for this facility. An estimation, based on the operational \nflow rate, cross section area of pipe, operational pressure of pipe, and the change in elevation of \nthe pipe. Using the RMP Comp software, a release from this type of pipe would result in a \nrelease of approximately 803 pounds per minute released into the atmosphere.  This release \ncould be due to mechanical error. This amount of vapor ammonia release would result in a \ndistance to endpoint of approximately 0.1 miles.  \n\nThis cold storage facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all \napplicable state codes and regulations. \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services \nGroup, Inc.
