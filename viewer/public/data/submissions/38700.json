This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our poicy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition the plant has coordinated with the local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam plates, bowls, and food containers.  We have one substance present at our facility which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is CBI-Flammable substance; and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The products are also often called \"blowing agents\" or \"expansion agents\".\n\nThe maximum inventory of CBI-Flammable substance possible at our facility exceeds the 10,000-pound RMP threshold.  \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard "

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPactiv Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pactiv Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nPactiv Corporation utilizes a detailed training and certification program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPactiv Corporation carries out  routine, periodic maintenance inspections and preventive maintenance on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined during inspections include bu"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  These personnel are provided specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures at Pactiv Corporation are in place to manage changes in process chemcials, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of changes and provided training, as needed, to deal with these changes.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pactiv Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that equipment and procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPactiv Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the requirements set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and promt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPactiv Corporation promptly investigates any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  Thes investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a potential release from reoccurring.  Reports are kept for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPactiv Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees a"

Many employees participate in safety initiatives within the plant.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility's implementation of RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.  Production employees sit in all HAZOP studies.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Proir to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Pactiv Corporation has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nHot Work\nThe facility maintains a hot work program and issues a hot work permit for hot work conducted on or near the covered process.  Hot work is performed by qualified personnel who complete each permit and fulfill its requirements prior to the start of a hot work operation.  These permits are kept on file until the conclusion of the hot work operation.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nPactiv Corporation has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\nPactiv Corporation has developed a written emergency response plan to deal with incipient stage fires and minor releases of hazardous materials such as leaking packing on valves.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including prompt notification of local emergency response agencies and the public;  emergency evacuations, if necessary ; adequate first aid and medical treatment should any be necessary.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes "
