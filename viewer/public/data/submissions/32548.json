The facility consists of 191acres in a industrial and commercial development. There are no residential units on the island. The main processes are distillation and catalytic reactions. The chemical in use  that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, are as follows:\n\nToxics\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a vapor in the process to control acidity.

In 2002, the hydrogen reformer was replaced with a higher capacity and more reliable unit. As a result, the plant has been able to reduce its inventory of liquified hydrogen to near zero except when the reformer has to be taken out of service for maintenance.\n\nAccidental release prevention programs and  contingency planning efforts help the facility to  effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of this chemical.\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that MSC provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternate (more likely scenarios) for our facility.  These analyses are available to authorized individuals in the federal state and local emergency response planning organizations.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility maintains several programs and practices designed to minimize the possibility of accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management per 29CFR1910.119\nEPA Risk Management Plan per 40CFR Part 68\nACC Responsible Care ? Process Safety Management Code \nIntegrated Contingency Plan which includes  all types of emergency planning  as required by EPA, OSHA regulations. \nInspections and Preventative Maintenance\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of toxic or flammable substance covered by the RMP rule since the plant started operations in 1981.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for  emergency response planning. The program provides the essential planni"

The plan is available to the Local Emergency Planning Council and to Responders for coordination with the community plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has a systematic program for reviewing process hazards and as improvements are identified as worthwhile, they will be implemented. The plant intends to continue maintaining a very low ( near zero) inventory of liquified hydrogen except during times when the hydrogen reformer unit is out of service for maintenance.\n\nCERTIFICATION\n\nThe undersigned certifies  that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\n\nSignature:\n\nTitle:\n\nDate:\n\n\n\nRMP ELEMENTS\n\nSection 1.
