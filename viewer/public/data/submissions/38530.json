Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the \r\nsafety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we \r\nuse, and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe designated position of overall responsibility for the development and integration of the \r\nrisk management program elements is the Municipal & Industrial Operations \r\nSuperintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\nChlorine is the chemical regulated by this standard.  The Material Safety Data Sheet \r\n(MSDS) contained in the MSDS booklet contains information regarding:\r\n\r\n? Toxicity\r\n? Permissible exposure limit (PEL)\r\n? Physical\r\n? Corrosivity\r\n? Thermal and chemical stability\r\n? Reactivity\r\n\r\nChlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable; however, like oxygen, it is an oxidizer and \r\nis capable of supporting combustion of certain substances.  Chlorine has a characteristic \r\npenetrating and irritating odor.  The gas is greenish yellow in color and the liquid is clear \r\namber.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine utilized at the Cement Hill Treatment Plant is isolated from other chemicals \r\nstored on site.  The possibility of mixing of incompatible chemicals is negligible.\r\n\r\n1.

COMPRESSED GAS.  STRONG OXIDIZER.  Contact with \r\ncombustible materials may cause fire or explosion.  Reacts violently or explosively with \r\nmany substances.  Reacts with water to form corrosive hydrochloric and hypochlorous \r\nacids.  Confined space hazard.  VERY TOXIC.  May be fatal if inhaled.  Extremely \r\nirritating to the respiratory tract.  Causes lung injury and effects may be delayed.  \r\nCORROSIVE to the eyes and skin.  Liquefied gas can cause frostbite and corrosive injury \r\nto the eyes and skin.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.  Very \r\ntoxic to aquatic organisms.  Can cause damage to vegetation.  Read the entire MSDS for a \r\nmore thorough evaluation of the hazards.\r\n \r\nPotential Health Effects:\r\n \r\nGeneral: Chlorine normally exists as a gas at room temperature and the most important \r\nroute of exposure is inhalation, followed by eye and skin exposures.  Liquefied chlorine \r\ncan freeze skin tissues. \r\nInhalation: Chlorine is a severe nose, throat and upper respiratory tract irritant.  People \r\nexposed to chlorine, even for short periods of time, can develop a tolerance to its odor and \r\nirritating properties.  In mild exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, cough, headache, \r\nsore throat, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea and pulmonary function deficits.  After more \r\nsevere exposures, clinical signs include rhinorrhea, ulcerative tracheobronchitis, \r\npulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death.\r\n \r\nThe following is a listing of chlorine exposure thresholds and estimated clinical effects:\r\n? 0.2 - 0.4 ppm - odor threshold (with considerable"

Direct contact with the \r\nliquefied gas escaping from its pressurized cylinder can cause frostbite.  Symptoms of mild \r\nfrostbite include numbness, prickling and itching in the affected area.  Symptoms of more \r\nsevere frostbite include a burning sensation and stiffness of the affected area.  The skin \r\nmay become waxy white or yellow.\r\n \r\nEye Contact: Chlorine gas is a severe eye irritant.  Stinging, a burning sensation, rapid \r\nblinking, redness and watering of the eyes have been observed at concentrations of 1 ppm \r\nand higher.  Direct contact with liquefied chlorine escaping from its high-pressure cylinder \r\nmay cause frostbite.  Burns and permanent damage, including blindness may result.\r\n \r\nIngestion: Ingestion is not an applicable route of exposure for gases.\r\n \r\nExisting Medical Conditions Possibly Aggravated by Exposure: Asthma, bronchitis, \r\nemphysema and other lung diseases and chronic nose, sinus or throat, and cardiac \r\nconditions.\r\n \r\nChronic Effects: A small number of human population studies conducted have not shown \r\nsignificant respiratory system effects in workers with long-term, low-level (typically less \r\nthan 1 ppm) chlorine exposure.  One study examined 332 workers exposed to time-\r\nweighted average (TWA) concentrations of between 0.006 and 1.42 ppm (0.15-ppm \r\naverage) for an average of 10.9 years.  No relationship was found between exposure to \r\nchlorine and the occurrence of colds, breathing difficulties, and abnormal heartbeat or \r\nchest pain.  Significant effects on lung function were not observed.  Studies of workers \r\nwho have had experienced one or mo"

      "SummaryText": "n a review of all operating procedures, as outlined in the Injury and Illness \r\nPrevention Program (IIPP).  SSWA has concluded that chlorine leaks are the hazard \r\ninvolved in the chlorination process.  The following addresses the hazards of the \r\nchlorination process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to chlorine \r\nleaks and their relationships, consequences of failure of those controls, and the \r\nconsequences of the effects on all workplace employees in or near the process area.\r\n\r\n1. Chemical Release\r\n\r\na) Continuous Release:\r\n\r\nChlorine can be released from a point source over a period of time.  An example of such a \r\nrelease is a leak through a faulty flange or improper connection.  Such a leak will get worse \r\nuntil the condition is corrected.  Until that time, the downwind hazards will continue.\r\n\r\nb) Slug Release:\r\n\r\nA slug release will occur if a vessel incurs a large puncture or rupture.  In the case of a \r\npuncture in the upper (vapor) portion of the vessel about one-fourth of the liquid \r\n(depending on the liquid temperature) will rapidly evaporate or \"flash off.. \r\n\r\nThis will cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric boiling point.  The evaporation rate \r\nof the remaining liquid primarily depends on the heat input from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a puncture in the liquid phase, liquid will be expelled through the hole until \r\nthe liquid level drops to the lip of the opening.  Most of the liquid expelled will \"flash off\" \r\nas it comes out of the tank, but some may spill on the ground.  The evaporation rate of the \r\nspilled liquid depends on heat input from the ground and from the sun.  Reducing the \r\nsurface area of the spill will reduce the evaporation rate.  The addition of water streams \r\nwill provide additional heat and will increase the evaporation rate.\r\n\r\nThe area and exposure duration depend upon the total quantity released, the rate of release, \r\nthe height of the release point, and weather conditions.

Hazards to Health\r\n\r\na) General\r\n\r\nChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant it is so intensely irritating that low \r\nconcentrations in air are readily detectable by the normal person.  At low concentrations, \r\nchlorine gas has an odor similar to household bleach.  As the concentrations increase from \r\nthe level of detection from smell so does symptomatology in the exposed individual.  At \r\nchlorine concentrations above 5 PPM the gas is very irritating and it is unlikely that any \r\nperson would remain in such an exposure for more than a very brief time unless she/he is \r\ntrapped or unconscious.\r\n\r\nb) Acute Toxicity\r\n\r\nIn concentrations near the threshold of smell, chlorine gas will, after several hours of \r\nexposure, cause mild irritation of the eyes of the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract.  \r\nAs concentrations increase there is an increase in the irritation effect on the eyes coughing \r\nmechanism and on the upper and lower respiratory tract with eventual difficulty in \r\nbreathing.  As the duration of exposure and/or the concentration increase, the affected \r\nindividual may become apprehensive and restless with coughing accompanied by throat \r\nirritation, sneezing, and excess salivation.  At higher levels there is vomiting associated \r\nwith labored breathing.  In extreme cases difficulty in breathing can progress to the point \r\nof death through suffocation.\r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine in contact with the eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.  All \r\nsymptoms and signs result directly or indirectly from its direct irritation action.  There are \r\nno known systemic effects.\r\n\r\nc) Chronic Toxicity\r\n\r\nLow concentrations of chlorine gas in the air may have minor irritation effects or may \r\nproduce slight symptoms after several hours of exposure, but careful examination of \r\npersons repeatedly exposed to such conditions reportedly has shown no permanent \r\nphysiological effect."

If the emission is extensive, all persons in the path of the \r\nfumes should be evacuated by the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nPotentially exposed persons should move to a point upwind of the leak.  Because chlorine \r\nis heavier than air, higher elevations are preferable.  To escape in the shortest time, persons \r\nalready in contaminated areas should move crosswind.  When outdoors without respiratory \r\nprotection, a wet handkerchief or cloth will reduce the effects of exposure.\r\n\r\nIf inside a building and evacuations seems to be impractical, all windows should be closed \r\nand air conditioners and air intake systems turned off.  Personnel should retreat to the \r\nhighest point of the building on the side away from the break.\r\n\r\nIf the leak is of a serious nature, the SSWA \"Emergency Response Plan\" will be initiated.  \r\nWhen calling for assistance the following information should be provided:\r\n\r\n1) Company name, address, telephone number, and the person to contact for \r\nfurther information.\r\n2) Description of the emergency.\r\n3) Travel directions to the site.\r\n4) Type and size of container involved.\r\n5) Corrective measures being applied.\r\n6) Other pertinent information regarding the weather conditions, injuries etc.\r\n\r\nIf the leak is serious the local Authorities must be notified to effect any necessary \r\nevacuation.
