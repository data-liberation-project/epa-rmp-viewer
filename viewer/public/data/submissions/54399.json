If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the proper authorities as outlined in our emergency response plan.    Sibley Generating Station uses propane for back-up fuel for power generation.  The propane system contains three 18,000 gallon propane tanks and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The worst-case scenario.  Our worst-case scenario for propane is the failure of one of the 18,000 gallon storage tanks resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The toxic endpoint distance was determined using Multi-Energy method and the distance to the endpoint is 0.24 mile.  Since the facility is located in a realtively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.  Our worst-case scenario for ammonia is the failure of the 7,000 gallon storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud release.  The toxic endpoint distance was determined using ISCST3 and the distance to the endpoint is 0.25 mile.   Since the facility is located in a realtively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Five year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving propane that cuased deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  The emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane or ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the proper authorities as outlined in our emergency response program and request that they respond to our emergency.  We have discussed emergency releases with the fire department and other responsib"
