(PFI), Lost Hills Facility (Facility) at 13646 Highway 33, Lost Hills, CA 93249 are committed to preventing the accidental release of any regulated substance.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, people, and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release of any regulated substance covered by this plan.\r\n\r\n2.\tDescription of the Stationary Source\r\nThe pistachio processing operations at the Facility consists of multiple hulling and drying operations, over 100 drying and storage silos, and various classifying, roasting and packaging operations.  The almond processing operation includes size grading and color sorting lines, hand sorting lines, blanching operations, sterilization equipment, flavoring equipment, roasting equipment, and packaging lines.  A water treatment plant at the Facility provides process water for the pistachio processing operations, the almond blanching operations, the boilers, and a state certified potable water plant that serves the Facility.\r\n\r\nSupply water for the water treatment plant is stored in a freshwater pond located approximately 650 yards east of the Facility.  Water is piped from the freshwater pond to an adjacent sand filtering plant and chlorination plant where it is injected with gaseous chlorine.  The water then travels through approximately 1 mile of piping to storage tanks located next to the water treatment plant.  Gaseous chlorine is utilized in the initial disinfection, primarily bacterial and viral destruction, of the process water.  The initial disinfection of the process water is achieved by withdrawing a metered volume of gaseous chlorine from one-ton cylind"

Normally, two one-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorine injection system; however, the operational design of the system allows only one cylinder to be in service at a time.  Typically, two additional one-ton cylinders are stored at the chlorination plant.\r\n\r\nThe integral components of the chlorine injection system are two automatic switchover vacuum regulators (one on each cylinder connected to the chlorine injection system), a stand-by pressure release (vent) valve, a manual adjusting valve with flow rate indicator, and a chlorine ejector assembly.  The vacuum regulators and manual adjusting valve meter the gas under vacuum and the ejector assembly creates the vacuum and mixes the gas with the water for transport and application.  No portion of the chlorine injection system is pressurized; the system in under vacuum from the ejector to the vacuum regulators located on the chlorine cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe Facility receives bulk shipments of almonds, pistachios, and packaging materials consisting of primarily cardboard and plastic containers.  Because the nuts and packaging materials can contain infestations of insects and because the Facility is producing food grade products suitable for human consumption, fumigants must be utilized to ensure that all shipments meet federal and client health standard criteria.  Therefore, Methyl bromide, hydrogen phosphide gas, and aluminum phosphide pellets are utilized for fumigation purposes at the Facility.  \r\n\r\nAluminum phosphide and hydrogen phosphide are both utilized for fumigation of bulk storage of nuts and shipping products. \r\n\r\nAluminum phosphide pellets are stored in the Pesticide Storage Shop in 3.3-pound aluminum flasks.  Depending on the volume of materials to be treated, a specific amount of pellets will be placed on cardboard trays that are then sealed with the material to be fumigated.  The pellets then decompose to rele"

Therefore, the following hypothetical situation was utilized as the alternate release scenario: during application of the pellets the contents of one can are spilled resulting in the release of 0.3 lb/hr of phosphine gas.  \r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario of phosphine was determined using ALOHA modeling program.\r\n\r\nc.\tHydrogen Phosphide:\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nRMP regulations mandate that the worst-case release scenario for hydrogen phosphide (Phosphine) as the release of the entire contents of one of the 39.7-pound hydrogen phosphide cylinder over a period of ten minutes.  However, due to the pyrophoric nature of phosphine, such a release would result in a vapor cloud explosion or a torch like flame at the point of the leak. Therefore, for the purpose of the worst-case release scenario, it was assumed that the connection to the silo/chamber being fumigated failed and that a 10,000 ppmv concentration of phosphine was released to the atmosphere for a period of 40 minutes at a flow rate of 118 ft3/min.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario of phosphine was determined using the ALOHA modeling program.

The worst-case release scenario assumes that the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder is emitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of calm winds and stagnant atmospheric conditions (1.5 meters/second wind speed and F atmospheric stability).  The Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) modeling program was used to estimate the downwind impacts for a one-ton chlorine release.  Rural surface roughness conditions were utilized to account for the relatively open land in the vicinity of the Facility.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association\u00bfs Emergency Response Planning Guidelines and Workplace Environmental Exposure Level Guides Handbook, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/L).  \r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario\r\nThe PHA team selected the following hypothetical situation as the alternate release scenario: during cylinder change-out or while in operation, the valve connection between the cylinder and vacuum regulator begins to leak.  The Handbook of Chlorination states that a chlorine withdrawal rate in excess 0.28 lb/min (400 lb/day) for a one-ton cylinder at 68 oF will lead to a cooling of the system and potential freezing of the cylinder.  However, for the purpose of this evaluation, a release rate of 0.6 lb/min was utilized.  It was also assumed that the leak would be repaired within 60 minutes.\r\n\r\nEPA suggested alternative release scenario parameters of 3.0 meters/second wind speed and D atmospheric stability were utilized the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with this release rate.  \r\n\r\nb.\tAluminum Phosphide:\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nAluminum phosphide (Fumitoxin) is imported to the site by truck and stored in 3.3-pound aluminum flasks.

      "SummaryText": "ince a maximum of 606 of the 3.3-pound Fumitoxin canisters are stored in a close proximity to each other, it was determined that all of the canisters could potentially be involved in a single release.  Aluminum phosphide composes only 55 percent of a Fumitoxin tablet which in turn is approximately 59% by weight phosphine gas at the end of the decomposition cycle.  Pursuant to the manufacture\u00bfs (Pestcon Systems Inc.) Applicators Manual for Fumitoxin, depending on temperature and humidity, Fumitoxin pellets release hydrogen phosphide (phosphine) gas as the aluminum phosphide reacts with atmospheric moisture to produce small quantities of gas.  In most cases, this release is slow enough to permit applicators to deposit the fumigant in the desired areas and then vacate the premises without significant exposure to the gas.  When moisture and temperature are high, decomposition of the pellets may be completed in less than three days; however at lower ambient temperatures with relatively high humidity levels, decomposition may require five days or more.\r\n\r\nBecause of the extensive reaction times discussed above, the average release rate for phosphine gas from aluminum phosphide was determined to be 216 lb/day.  This was determined by taking the total amount of Fumitoxin present (2000 lb) and multiplying it by 55 percent (the percent by weight of aluminum phosphide in Fumitoxin) and then by 59 percent (the percent by weight of phosphine gas that is produced from aluminum phosphide), all of this occurring over a 3 day period (2000 lb x 0.55 x 0.59 / 3 days = 216 lb/day) and assuming that the concentration of phosphine in the atmosphere does not reach 18,000 ppmv which is the auto-ignition point of phosphine gas.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Appendix A of CCR Title 19, the toxic endpoint for phosphine is 0.0035 mg/l (2.5 ppm).
