Only qualified maintenance personnel operate the refrigeration system.\n\n1.4\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at the Scenic Fruit facility in the past five years. \n\n1.5\tEmergency Planning and Response\n\nScenic Fruit has a written emergency action plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It complies with the provisions of OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events. This plan has been provided to and reviewed with the Salem Fire Department.\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Scenic Fruit and to establish precautions and procedures to protect life, safety, and health during an emergency. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, Scenic Fruit has trained personnel to immediately notify the Salem Fire Department and take defensive actions to mitigate the release. Automatic alarms, shutdown systems, and controls have been designed to minimize the potential for an uncontrolled release.\n\nAll Scenic Fruit personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n1.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with codes and standards applicable at that time.\n\nScenic Fruit is scheduled to update and revalidate the PHA by Dece"

To prevent accidents, Scenic Fruit has implemented a process safety management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) \u00a71910.119, which requires integrated safeguards to prevent an ammonia release. A crucial component of this plan is the emergency action plan, developed in compliance with the emergency planning provisions of OAR Chapter 437 Division 002. The emergency action plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.2\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\nScenic Fruit processes fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables, purees, and concentrates. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of foods, and Scenic Fruit uses ammonia as the refrigerant. Access to the facility is limited to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n1.3\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nScenic Fruit\u2019s written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment. Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA), operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed annually, audited every three years, and updated as necessary by Scenic Fruit.\n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating the refrigeration system understands the refrigeration process, the operating procedu"
