The treatment plant utilizes pre-chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration processes to ensure the quality of the water.  \r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe Niagara County Water District Williams Road Treatment Plant provides potable water for 150,000 people in Towns and Villages located in Niagara, Erie and Orleans Counties.  The treatment plant utilizes pre-chlorination, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration processes to ensure the quality of the water.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled \r\nThe Niagara County Water District operates a 48-MGD Water Treatment Plant that uses chlorination for disinfection and zebra mussel control.  Chlorine (Cl2) is a regulated substance that is used in the water treatment process and stored at the treatment plant.  There are eight (8) one-ton tanks used for the storage of chlorine.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored at the treatment plant is therefore 16,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Niagara County Water District (NCWD) periodically conducts hazard reviews to identify, evaluate and control the risk associated with the process hazards and chemical release scenarios at the NCWD Williams Road Water Treatment Plant.  The overall purpose of the hazard review is to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release and to comply with EPA regulations. Whenever necessary, recommendations are made during the review to reduce the risk associated with a hazard or release scenario to an acceptable level.  \r\nAt the NCWD or any other water treatment plant, well-trained operators are integral to preventing and mitigating the effects of accidental chemical releases.  The NCWD provides an employee-training program for all Cl2 operato"

Personnel and contractors working at the regulated facility receive emergency response awareness-level training.  In addition, selected Cl2 operators and maintenance personnel receive responder-level training.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Niagara County Water District chlorine system is an EPA RMP-regulated process.\r\nThe Niagara County Water District has a mechanical integrity program.  The purpose of the mechanical integrity program is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment.  An effective mechanical integrity program is integral to preventing accidental chemical releases that may result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained equipment.  As a key component of the mechanical integrity program the NCWD contracts annual maintenance, testing, and inspection to Neal Systems Incorporated (NSI) so that adequate expertise is provided.  The mechanical integrity program includes the following elements:\r\n\u00bf\tIdentification of critical equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\u00bf\tWritten maintenance, testing and inspection schedules and procedures.\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance personnel training.\r\n\u00bf\tMaintenance, testing, and inspection completion and documentation.\r\n\u00bf\tCorrection of equipment deficiencies.\r\n\u00bf\tQuality assurance of new equipment.\r\nAll incidents at the NCWD Williams Road Plant which resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in a release of chlorine, will be promptly investigated.  The purpose of the incident investigation procedure is to identify the underlying causes of an incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring. \r\nAny changes performed to the chlorine system must first go through the Management of Change (MoC) procedure.  The purpose of the MoC procedure is to ensure that system changes are properly reviewed against original system design specifications and can be accomplished safely, and that system"

The chlorine feed room is continuously monitored by chlorine gas sensors which will activate an alarm system if the ambient chlorine gas levels reach 2 ppm.
