This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. gasoline, fuel oil, propane, butane, lubricating oils, wax and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has the multiple flammable mixtures that include the following RMP-regulated flammables; methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, butane, butene, isopentane, pentane, 1-pentene, and hydrogen. The refinery does not have any of the listed regulated toxic chemicals above the threshold quantity for reporting. The refinery's  process units containing RMP-covered flammable materials are considered a single program 3 covered process.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Holly Tulsa Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each applicable OSHA PSM element and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery encourages employees to participate in all elements of process saf"

Examples of employee participation include employees serving as members on Process Hazards Analysis teams as well as Incident Investigation teams. Employees also serve as trainers and procedure writers. Employees also form the Emergency Response Fire Brigade and Haz Mat teams for the refinery and receive a high level of training to maintain qualifications. Employees participate in our Joint Health, Safety and Environmental committee. Also, teams are involved in Job Hazards Analysis for nonroutine tasks, Safety Scorecard Program, and Safety Survey Program, in which our employees provide their services performing various audits and enhancing their safety awareness. Our process unit operators monitor their areas of responsibility and provide monthly reports on the status of various safety and emergency response equipment. All Holly Tulsa Refinery employees participate in the Total Event Reporting process where near misses and incidents are reported and tracked.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information (PSI). Each process unit has its specific PSI training material for the operating personnel.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals. Each process area also has available all the equipment listed including what, if"

For each process area, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g.; temperature, level, pressure) and studied hazard scenarios via the Process Hazards Analysis process. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, What-If technique and Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to perform these evaluations. HAZOP and What-If analysis are recognized as the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. LOPA is a semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology that involves the quantitative evaluation of a qualitative hazard scenario(s) to determine if the existing safeguards are adequate. The analyses are conducted using a multi-disciplined team with experience back"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. Resolution of items can be generally categorized as Procedures, Repairs of Existing Equipment, Engineering Studies and Installing new equipment. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Holly Tulsa Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Holly Tulsa Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified a"
