              "Description": "Prevention Program Description\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO maintains a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119 for terminals handling LPG products.  The PSM program covers all 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulations.  Program documentation is maintained onthe TRANSFLO central electronic system and is accessible to terminal managers and operators.\n\n\n\nAll LPG transfer operations use similar transfer equipment, common operating procedures and network wide policies and procedures to transfer LPG products between rail tank cars and highway transports.  A master Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on 10/22/14 by a qualified team of professionals meeting the requirements of PHA team makeup.  Full documentation of this activity is maintained by TRANSFLO.  A site specific PHA using a Checklist method will be conducted to identify and address local terminal specific hazards or conditions as part fothe Pre Start-up Safety Review. \n\n\n\nMaximum product inventory is the contents of a single rail tank car.  Tank cars at the terminal are not interconnected during this process.  There is no process chemistry involved in this process.  There is no mixing or blending of products.  The LPG products are not altered or reacted during this process.   Process Safety Information is maintained on the TRANSFLO electronic file system. \n\n\n\nA formal Pre Start-up Safety Review (PSSR) will be conducted the week of 10/15/18 with terminal management, operators and TRANSFLO staff to conduct hazard communication training, operating instructions training and conduct unit inspection and maintenance training.  The PSSR will cover the local site hazards as well as demonstration of operator competence for conducting the transfers.    Documentation of the PSSR will be maintained for the life of this process. \n\n\n\nThis terminal is also subject to current TRANSFLO policy and procedures including Employee Participation Plan, Management of Change procedures, Terminal Work Permit System (including hot work procedures) procedure, accident reporting and investigation procedures.   These procedures are avaialbe to all terminal managers and TRANSFLO operations personnel.  \n\n\n\nTRANSFLO conducts internal compliance audits of all PSM/RMP terminals on a 3-years basis.  This terminal will be scheduled for such an audit by 10/15/21.\n\n\n\nPlease refer to PSM/RMP documentation available a the terminal office and on the TRANSFLO Gateway for copies of the referenced procedures, standards and documented activity.  \n\n",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\n\n\nBackground Data\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Federal Environmental Administration (EPA), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations involving Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) at their Atlanta, GA facility.  The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Atlanta GA TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1982.  The terminal is located at 1000 Chattahoochee Avenue  NW, Atlanta, GA.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO will handle liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) products at this terminal, transloading product between railroad tank cars and highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons per cargo trailer which will exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for LPG products using the parameters specified by the EPA.  TRANSFLO's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a single railroad tank car with subsequent product release over a 10-minute period.  In developing the release parameters of the worst-case scenario, TRANSFLO has not considered any passive mitigation measures.  Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low pr"

      "SummaryText": "obability of occurrence.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nTRANSFLO also evaluated several other release scenarios considered to have a higher level probability of occurrence (although a very low probability) based upon a review of over 10 years of incident data from chemical transloading operations.  This 10 year period included the safe handling of over 500,000 rail to truck chemical transloads.  After a careful review of both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, TRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  In developing the parameters of Alternative Release Scenario 1, TRANSFLO considered the average response time of terminal personnel to control the release and safely shut the transfer unit down.   Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA's RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flammable endpoint in the alternative release scenario has the potential to result in minor site consequences at a distance much less than the worst-case scenario and would largely be limited to terminal property itself.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of LPG products, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures:\n\n\n\n?    TRANSFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP'S) for the Transloading of LPG products from railcar to highway cargo tank for use by trained and qualified personnel.\n\n?    TRANSFLO encourages contract operator employees to voice concerns, offer suggestions and contribute to procedures, policies and processes involving this product.  Employees are \n\n        expected to follow established procedures until employee driven process changes are implemented, training conducted and communicated to all affected persons.\n\n?
