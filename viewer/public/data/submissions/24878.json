The process will include:\n\n\u00b7 On-site aqueous ClO2 generation system\n\u00b7 ClO2 delivery system consisting of gas emitters located within the building\n\u00b7 Exhaust system with scrubbers to maintain a negative pressure within the building\n\u00b7 Scrubbing liquid delivery systems. \n\nThe fumigation system is expected to go on operation in March 2002 and will be operated only for the purpose mentioned above. After fumigation, ClO2 will be removed from the building, and the systems will be dismantled.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is prepared because the total quantity of ClO2 in the system is expected to exceed the threshold quantity.  The RMPlan is specifically for the ClO2 fumigation process because no other process in the facility handles or stores any listed chemical above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed based on gaseous release of all ClO2 within the building during fumigation.  The emission of ClO2 was calculated based on an average concentration of 750 ppmv within the building.  The resulting impact distance was 3.7 miles.  The impact distance is defined as the distance to the toxic endpoint mentioned in the RMP (1 ppmv).  The alternative scenario was based on a hazard review of the process and involved failure of the scrubbing liquid in the exhaust air system, resulting in a release of ClO2 for a period of 15 minutes. The resulting impact distance was 0.08 miles for the same toxic endpoint.  In both cases, the impacts extend outside the facility property line.\n\nThe fumigation process is not covered by OSHA PSM regulations.  Therefore, this process was considered as Program Level 2 per Risk Management Program guidelines. Prevention program elements listed in this RMPlan refer to the fumigation process only.  As many of the elements of the prevention program (i.e. training program, m"

However, all elements of the prevention program will be in place prior to operation of the fumigation process."
