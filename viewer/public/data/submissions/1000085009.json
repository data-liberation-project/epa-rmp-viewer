WRT believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nWRT is designed, operated, and maintained in a manner that promotes the health and safety of workers, contractors, and the community and protects the environment. This is accomplished through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that WRT has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nA.STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLES\n\n\n\nWRT is a bulk storage liquefied petroleum gas terminal. Regulated substances stored onsite include butane, propane, isobutane, and mixtures of these products. LPGs are received and shipped by pipeline, railcars, and trucks and stored mainly in underground salt dome caverns.  An above ground bullet tank and on-site railcars are also used for the LPG storage.  \n\n\n\nThis facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with API 2510 codes for the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  The storage wells are maintained, operated, and tested in accordance with the New Mexico Oil Conservation Department regulation applicable to underground LPG storage.  In addition, the facility complies with E"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nThe WRT accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by on-site regulated substances to our employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the WRT:\n\n\n\n1) Employee Participation\n\n2) Process Safety Information\n\n3) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n4) Standard Operating Procedures\n\n5) EHS Operator Training\n\n6) Contractors\n\n7) Pre-startup Safety Review\n\n8) Mechanical Integrity with Preventive Maintenance\n\n9) Work Permits\n\n10) Management of Change\n\n11) EHS Accident or Potential Catastrophic Event Investigation\n\n12) Emergency Response\n\n13) Compliance Audits\n\n14) Trade Secrets\n\n\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of the prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. WRT and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, WRT also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of its operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards (API 2510)\n\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.)\n\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams\n\n-Operating systems monitored and c"
