The primary purpose of the facility is to \nprocess potatoes into food products such as French fries for distribution to retailers and \nrestaurants.\n\nAmmonia is classified by the EPA as a toxic chemical, and it is necessary to observe certain safety \nprecautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the health threat to \nour workers and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to \nadhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon a combination of how we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the \nsafe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119. A \ncrucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the \nEmergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n1.10 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since the start-up of the existing \nfacility in 1996. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia \nRefrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and complies with state codes.\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using on-the-job training and a formal \ntraining program. This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to ensure adequate response to equipment integrity.\n\nThe process has numerous safeguards, including:\n-Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n-Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from forklifts.\n-The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident o"

A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system. The PHA addressed: (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of the control system failures.\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used to refrigerate areas of the facility where food products are processed and/or stored. The refrigeration equipment compresses, condenses, and evaporates ammonia in a closed-loop system to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\n1.30 The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including \nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA. Offsite receptors were defined \nusing ArcGIS Pro 3.4.2 in conjunction with Google Maps. This system estimates the residential \npopulation within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release \nscenarios. In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental \nreceptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nCavendish Farms complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \nstate codes and regulations.

Plan elements essential to the safe operation of the \nrefrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard \nanalysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical \nintegrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency response and planning, and compliance audits. This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.\nWritten Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to provide the basis for the proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.\nFor projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to \nensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the \nengineering design and in condition to be operated before startup.\nContractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" \nbased upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and \nstandards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely. Each of these contractors is evaluated \nfrom a safety perspective.\nThe Plant has a program for the replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5-year interval as \nrecommended by IIAR.\n\n1.50 Five-Year Accident History\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Cavendish Farms in the past five years that has resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.60 Emergency Response Progra"

The \nemergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local \nemergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility \nemergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements. The \nemergency response plan has been discussed with the Jamestown Fire Department and other agencies involved with the response. Representatives of the Jamestown Fire Department visit this plant on an annual basis.\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders who are available to minimize any ammonia release. These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n1.70 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will comply with those standards applicable at that time. Cavendish Farms identified recommendations to improve safety during the most recent compliance audit in October 2022. These recommendations are scheduled to be completed by June 2027."
