North Baker Flats Facility\r\n\r\nA.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\r\n\r\nThe Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, employee training and management practices.  \r\n\r\nThe Company's emergency response plan involves the preparation of action plans and training of employees. The Company's refrigeration personnel are trained in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.119\r\n\r\nAt The Company, anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\u00bf\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to our personnel\r\n\u00bf\tReduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nMcDougall & Sons Inc. North Baker Flats Facility is a fruit packing and cold storage facility, located at 5905 Nelpar Drive East Wenatchee, Douglas County, WA.  The facility receives fruit from the surrounding area and packages them for shipment to wholesale and retail customers. The facility is also used as a refrigerated warehouse to hold fruit in storage till it can be packaged for shipment. \r\n\r\nThe hazardous substances which exceed the threshold quantity IAW EPCRA at North Baker Flats are: \r\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia, AKA NH3, or R717. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility as refrigerant. CAS number is 7664-41-7\r\n2.\tSulfuric Acid which is used as an electrolyte for batteries that power forklifts used in the movement of product throughout the facility. CAS number is 7664-93-9\r\n\r\nC.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Company's accidental release prevention program is based on the following ke"
