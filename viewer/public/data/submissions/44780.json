Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system.\n* Ammonia detection is hard wired to ventilation system to activate exhaust fans in the event of a release in the chiller building.\n* Refrigeration Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of  parameter indications. \n* High level alarms and system shut offs are installed on pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the vessels will activate a shutdown of the compressors.\n* Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential for an over-pressure condition within the vessel and the refrigeration system.\n* Emergency stop buttons installed outside the chiller building on the east and west sides, in facility main control room, and in the 4160 VOlt electric room.\n* Computerized \"MAXIMO\" preventative maintenance program is instituted within the maintenance department to ensure all refrigeration components are maintained in optimum operational and mechancal condition.\n* Continual vibration analysis of compressors and condenser fans is provided to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.\n*A pan-tilt-zoom camera with a video  monitor allows monitoring of the chiller room from the control room.",
