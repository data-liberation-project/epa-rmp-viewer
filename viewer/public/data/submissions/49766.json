EVE plans to begin operations at the ethanol plant in September 2007. Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed, and much of the training has been ongoing.  Given that EVE is a new facility, there have been periodic reviews and revisions to reports and information maintained at the facility to date.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nEVE has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nEVE?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and denaturant tank are all located in a large bermed Tank Farm containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire could be quickly extinguished.  EVE has coordinated with the Norfolk Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe EVE Ethanol Plant is located near Norfolk, Madison County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture.  EVE Ethanol Plant has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles; due to the amount of ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for denaturant is about 0.7 miles.\n\nOff-site "

      "SummaryText": "Consequence Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is the release of all 102,420 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.   The worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 925,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.7 mile radius.\n\nAlthough EVE Ethanol Plant has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 550,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.6 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS is the toxic release of 4,780 pounds per minute of ammonia.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles from the center of the facility.  There are public receptors within the 0.1 mile radius that would be affected by both alternative releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nEVE Ethanol Plant has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances onsite. There have been no accidents at this time.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe EVE Ethanol Plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency respo"
