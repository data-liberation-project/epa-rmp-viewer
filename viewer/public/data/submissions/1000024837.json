Ascend - Decatur Plant is one of the chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently approximately 245 Ascend employees and approximately 130 permanent resident contractor employees.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 651.82 acre tract (peninsula), 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River (river mile 302). The peninsula is shared by guest operations.  Linde occupies 4 acres, Calphine 20 acres, Toray 50 acres, Styrolution 21 acres.  Over 300 acres are presently in use by Ascend.  The remainder acreage is the old Acrilan footprint which is currently unutilized.\n\n\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber. In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site. The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005. There are two toxic chemicals in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. In addition, flammable liquid hydrogen storage will be added to the faciilty on 12/1/2011. The RMP regulated chemicals are:\n\n\n\n    Acrylonitrile (AN) -- A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\n    Propionitrile (PN) -- A by-product from manufacture of nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\n    Hydrogen - A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe main raw material"

The area is also visually inspected at least twice daily.  \n\n *  Tank dike would minimize the release of material.  Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank.\n\n *  An operator would notify the site coordinator immediately.  Cleanup would be handled by the HAZMAT team.\n\n *  ACAM sensors are located in the units to alarm operations when the detection of AN is present in the areas.\n\n\n\n  Propionitrile (PN)\n\n * ACAM system would alarm due to high PN concentration in the air.  The sump level alarm would trigger.  This alarm can only be turned off at a location next to the tank, so someone would have to notice the release while acknowledging the alarm. "
