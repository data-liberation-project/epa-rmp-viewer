One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the II-VI Saxonburg facilities.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u00a7 68.155(b))\n\nThe II-VI Saxonburg facilities include several materials production plants.  One materials production plant handles one substance that is regulated by the RMP rule.  This substance is hydrogen selenide.\n \nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(c))\n\nThe II-VI Saxonburg facility's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Procedures\n* Contractor Safety\n\nThe prevention program is documented and maintained at the facility.  It is updated when necessary.\n\nFive-year Accident"
