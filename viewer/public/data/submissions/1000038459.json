Safety relief valves, bypass flow valves, check valves and remote access emergency shutdown devices are in place at the plant.  The plant is monitored via SCADA on a 24 hour/7day a week/365 days a year basis by operators at the Marathon Kenedy Office as well as by field operators when they are physically at the facility.  Employees have had hands on fire extinguisher training and function specific training as required by OSHA.  New employees receive classroom instruction as well as one on one training with experienced employees prior to being allowed to operate any equipment. The facility is equipped with a flare system that prevents atmospheric release of product.  Marathon has a Safe Work Permitting program and Lockout/tagout procedures which are strictly enforced.  Marathons Safe Work Permitting program covers various tasks (e.g., hot work, confined space entry, vehicle access to classified areas, High H2S situations, and any other hazardous work that requires additional planning and/or monitoring.).  This facility has developed a PSM program and conducts periodic Process Hazard Analysis studies.",

      "SummaryText": "Natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility via pipeline from several Central Production Facilities.  The natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility through a pig trap and a multi-finger slug catcher.  Gas from the slug catcher is compressed by one of four single staged flow-through compressors, dehydrated by one of two glycol dehydration units then sent to multiple sales points via two sales scrubbers.  The liquids from the slug catcher are routed to the liquids side of the process where any water is separated from the liquids.  The liquids flow through a caustic wash system to remove H2S, and a carbon filtration unit to treat the color (if needed) for pipeline quality purposes. The resulting NGL is then stored in pressurized bullet tanks prior to exiting the facility via pipeline (the normal operation mode after June 2013), or by truck (used during periods of pipeline shutdowns) to a third party gas plant for further processing.  Additionally in January 2014 Marathon began processing stabilized NGL's received from a third party (Murphy).  These third party NGL's are hauled to the plant via truck.  They are unloaded into a pressurized tank and then are introduced into the Marathon process and are commingled with Marathons production (described above).  NGL's is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Because NGL's are pressurized flammable gas, it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent fire/explosion risks and reduce health threats to our workers and neighbors.  Marathon has implemented various health and safety programs and processes and will strictly adhere to all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.   \n\n\n\nSafety depends on:        \n\n(a) The manner in which we handle this product        \n\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility        \n\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and         \n\n(d) Employee training    \n\n\n\nMarathon Eagle Ford Asset Team's emergency response program details employee responsibilities"
