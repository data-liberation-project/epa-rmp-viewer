ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nWe at the Seneca Foods Facility in Glencoe, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, emergency shut downs, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of an incidental release.  We also notify and coordinate response efforts with the Glencoe Fire Department providing emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
