Wheelabrator Shasta has one anhydrous\nammonia tank.  The ammonia from the tank is used in Shasta's air pollution control system for nitrogen oxides.  The tank size\nis 12,000 gallons but is filled to no more than 10,200 gallons.\n\nThe ammonia process at Shasta is subject to OSHA 1910 requirements for Process Safety Management.  Compliance with the\n1910 requirements as supplemented by the RMP specific requirements are the basis for Shasta's accidential release prevention program for ammonia.\n\nThe response program includes notification of the appropriate County Agencies and they are the responding agency for any release.\n\n\n(b) The stationary source and the regulated substance handled:\n\nRESPONSE:     Wheelabrator Shasta's electrical generation facility converts biomass fuels into electrical energy.  The sole\nregulated substance subject to the RMP requirements is ammonia as used in (a) above.\n\n\n(d) The general accidential release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nRESPONSE:     The general accidential release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps include:\n1. Conformance to the Safety Procedures as established for the ammonia process used at the site including conformance with\nthe OSHA 1910 Process Safety Management requirements.\n2. Training of all personnel in the Safety Procedures for ammonia use.\n3. Inspection of the ammonia tank and associated delivery system in accordance with the preventative maintenance checks"
