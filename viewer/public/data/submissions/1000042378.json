We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.  \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1970.\r\n\r\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.  \r\n \r\nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.  \r\n \r\nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to"
