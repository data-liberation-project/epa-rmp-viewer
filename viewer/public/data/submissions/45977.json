The company has maintained diverse asphalt distribution and application operations at multiple facilities since its founding in 1925.  IRC operates two asphalt terminals on the Illinois River; one in Meredosia, Illinois and the other in Utica, Illinois.  The Meredosia Terminal also has an aqueous ammonia production plant.  A corporate Safety Program covering OSHA / DOT / EPA standard applicable to various operations is reviewed annually by upper management and by selected facility personnel.  Standard Operating Procedures are written for most job tasks associated with material handling, operations, and waste management.  A Corporate Safety Committee is comprised of individuals from each of the terminals.\nAsphalt is off-loaded from barges at the terminal's river dock and transported through heated piping to heated storae tanks at the terminal.  From the storage tanks, asphalt is loaded onto trailers for distribution to client locations or to asphalt road constrcution project sites.  Approximately 20,000 barrels (7,140,000 pounds) of asphalt is off-loaded, stored, and handled at the terminal annyally.\nThe Meredosia Terminal has a Facility Response Plan for land-based operations and a Vessel Response Plan for water-based operations under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90).\n\nIn the first ammonia-related process, anhydrous ammonia is loaded onto IRC trailers from storage tanks at a nearby off-site terminal on the Illinois River.  The anhydrous ammonia may be off-loaded into temporary storage in a containment tank at Meredosia Terminal, or may be off-loaded into aqueous manufacturing tanks at the terminal.  \n\nThe second ammonia-related process is handled in the Ammonia Production and Handling Plant (APHP) is a separate and dedicated area of Meredosia Terminal.  Two food-grade aqueous products are produced in the process, 19% and 29%.  The product solutions are "

Equipment and vehicular traffic associated with asphalt storage and distribution resides in an area of the terminal separate from ammonia operations.  Secondary containment for liquid releases from the Ammonia Production and Handling Plant is isolated from secondary containment areas for asphalt releases.  The secondary containment capacity for the APHP (Facility Containment Area #1) is 556,025 gallons.  The APHP is covered by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management standard.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia during normal operating conditions is 8,221 gallons (42,340 pounds), and the maximum amount used or stored at the facility in the last twelve months is 18,204 gallons (93,749 pounds).  The amount of aqueous ammonia during normal operating conditions is 199,080 gallons (1,513,008 pounds), and the maximum amount stored at the facility is 99,540 gallons (756,504 pounds).\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia in the past five years.  The emergency Response Program for accidental ammonia releases or spills is part of the OPA-90 Facility Response Plan.  \n\nProcedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia.  Procedures are in place for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance.

Procedures are reviewed and updated annually, and as appropriate to reflect process or equipment changes.
