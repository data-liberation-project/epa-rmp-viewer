The City of Kilgore Waste Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The City of Kilgore Waste Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Kilgore Waste Water Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n?    Chlorine Gas - stored in 1-ton cylinders and used for disinfection of water prior to discharge.\n\n?    Sulfur Dioxide Gas - stored in 1-ton cylinders and used for dechlorination of water prior to discharge.\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n The RMP Rule requires The City of Kilgore Waste Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n?    One worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n?    One worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n?    One alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n?    One "
