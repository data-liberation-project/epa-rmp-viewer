(hereafter referred to as MarkWest) owner and operator of the Majorsville Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATION SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Majorsville Gas Plant processes raw gas from several field gathering systems.  Natural gas is brought into the plant where it will first pass through a coalescer to remove liquid droplets from the gas stream.  The gas is then passed through the molecular sieve to remove entrained water vapor.  Next, the gas is passed through a chiller to reduce the temperature of the gas to approximately -10F after which it will pass through a separator which removes the liquid portion.  After the chilling and separation the gas goes through a turbo expander to quickly reduce the gas pressure, which causes additional heavy particles to become liquid and drop from the gas stream.  Finally, the gas is put through the deethanizer tower to remove ethane from the stream.  The residue gas is then sent into a sales pipeline and the collected liquids are piped to the Houston Gas Plant in Washington County, Pennsylvania.\n\nFlammable mixtures at the site are present in the surge tank which is used to ensure that a constant flow can be sent through the pipeline to the Houston Gas Plant.  The liquids are considered to be Y-grade.  The release scenarios breakdown the constituents of flammable materials in the Y-grade based on a condensate analysis taken from the surge tank.\n\nFor addition"

Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation but are not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement accident prevention.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design "

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nEach PHA will address the following:\na)    hazards of the process,\nb)    previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences,\nc)    consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls,\nd)    engineering and administrative control applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships,\ne)    facility siting issues, \nf)    human factors.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility or every 5 years, whichever comes first.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. The operating procedures are centrally located and accessible to all employees.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, MarkWest has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations unless they provide written certification that they have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to safely carry out their specific duties and responsibilities.

The basic aspects of this program include: training; written procedures; inspections and tests; correcting identified deficiencies; and applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The PSSR confirms that construction was completed in accordance with design specifications, that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.  The PSSR will be reviewed and appropriately updated during the management of change process.  The PSSR will ensure that: modifications were installed as described; no other changes were made outside the original scope of work; operating procedures have been modified and communicated to operating and maintenance personnel; all necessary tests have been completed prior to start-up; all site safety , fire protection, and environmental issues have been addressed; the startup plan has been reviewed; pertinent drawings have been red-lined or updated to as-built requirements; vendor files have been updated; and training of affected personnel has been performed and documented.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, MarkWest perio"

The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident.  The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard anyalsis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.  The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operation.  The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed.  Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\n\nContractors\n\nMarkWest may use contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe "

In addition, MarkWest will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Majorsville Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safely features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Majorsville Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Majorsville Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection\n\nHydrocarbon monitors to detect potential gas releases.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1.    Process relief valves venting that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases,\n2.     Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated),\n3.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature),\n4.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases,\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., non-interruptible power supply for lighting and glycol pump).\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.    Trained emergency response personnel\n2.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective cloth"

SPCC Plan\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Majorsville Gas Plant has no accidents to a covered process within the past 5 years.  \n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Majorsville Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Majorsville Gas Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The coordination may include periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives,.  The Majorsville Gas Plant has around -the -clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire dep"
