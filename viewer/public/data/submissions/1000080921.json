Our plant manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program (RMP).  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, and training, and the experience necessary to manage the program.  The RMP coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": " purpose is to produce polyurethane foam for the diaper, automotive, and many other specialty foam markets.  Polyurethane foam is manufactured by combining specific ratios of chemical streams in a mixing chamber where the reacting ingredients are dispensed onto a moving conveyor system.  The reacting mixture cures into the form of a slabstock bun.  The foam buns are fabricated into spools, rolls, and other specialty parts.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by the EPA's risk management rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by rail car and on rare occasions, by tanker truck; it is stored in nine tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 566,127 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nHazard reviews of our processes\n\nOperator procedures\n\nTraining\n\nEquipment Maintenances Program\n\nRMP Compliance Audits\n\nAccident/Incident Investigation\n\nContractor Training\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nProcess Equipment Change\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines the hazards of handling Toluene Diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce the hazards of Isocyanate exposure to the employees, the community, and the environment.  Process controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, bursting disk, and system interlocks).\n\n\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to "

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n4.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe are very proud of the fact that we have had no reportable accidents at the Woodbridge, Chattanooga facility during the past five years.\n\n\n\n5.    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department.  The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department all have copies of an SDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits our plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release.  The following responses are addressed in our plan:\n\n\n\nProper Notifications in the event of a Release (internal and external)\n\nSystemic Shutdown of Operations\n\nEvacuation of Personnel\n\nFirst Aid Procedures\n\nEmergency Response Team Actions\n\nDecontamination of Personnel and Equipment\n\nManagement of Waste Material\n\nStart up of Operations\n\nAccident/Incident Investigations\n\n\n\n6.
