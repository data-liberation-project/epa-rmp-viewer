In our companyA?s Mission Statement, A?The Safety and health of our employees are paramount.A?A culture of safety is fostered from the company founder throughout top management down to and including every worker in our plant.  In the fall of 2009, OSHA accepted Trident Akutan into its SHARP program (Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program).  Anhydrous ammonia is used in excess of the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds.  A management system has been developed to administer the chemical safety plan for prevention of accidents, and accidental releases both within the facility and the surrounding area.  There is an Emergency Response Plan developed for both chemical and other emergencies.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nA combined 116,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is used for chilling fish and surimi and the freezing and storage of processed seafood in our two main process buildings.  OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Program (PSM) and EPAA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) are used as guidance for the safety of Trident workers and protection of the nearby community.  \n\nThere are 14 sections in our PSM prevention program.  Employee Participation is the foundation and backbone of the program.  A Process Hazard Analysis is conducted and revalidated every 5 years.  A follow up report details recommendations.  Standard Operating Procedures are developed for the operation and maintenance of equipment and system operation.  These procedures are reviewed yearly.  Training occurs weekly in most months of the year.  An annual HAZWOPER training and drill occurs on a yearly basis.  The facility has Emergency Response and Planning organized detailing responsibilities and roles in emergency response.  Cri"

      "SummaryText": "tical equipment and contact telephone numbers are included and updated in this section.  Incident Investigation chronicles ammonia incidents and near misses in the plant.  Releases over 100 pounds, and reportable injuries are immediately reported to the proper local, state and federal authority.  Mechanical Integrity documents how the facility is designed, constructed, inspected and maintained.  Management of Change documents technical aspects, materials and codes. A hazard analysis or safety review is conducted.  Training and standard operating procedures and any changes in the Process Safety Information are updated for any change that is not A?like in kind.A?  Hot Work Permits are issued to insure that all hot work is safely performed in any area where there may be safety considerations.  Contractor Safety is documented.  The contractor working at the facility must be qualified and trained to perform his job duties.  In addition, the facility must inform the contractor about hazards unique to the plant and also what to do in plant emergencies.  A Pre-Start-up Safety Review is necessary for new systems or systems where there is a change to process inventory.  Any Trade Secrets are identified.  Finally a Compliance Audit is conducted every 3 years. This audit reviews each section of our prevention program.  A follow up report details recommendations made to improve the program.\n\nFollowing program guidelines a Worse Case release of ammonia and an alternative Worse Case release is considered and a report developed.  This Hazard Assessment is useful in the development of our Emergency Response Plan and the model generated in this report would be useful in an actual release.\n\n \n\nFive year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  A record of incidents is kept.  An incident investigation is performed to determine the cause of each incident and to develop recommendations to prevent a re-occurrence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Re"

There are a large number of trained responders, many trained to the Hazmat Technician level.  There is annual HAZWOPER training and refresher training conducted plant wide.  Hazmat team members train monthly or more often.\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nThe plant manager holds daily staff meetings.  Any safety concern is noted and steps are taken to resolve safety related issues immediately.  Weekly safety meetings are conducted.  Safety incidents are reviewed and each week some area of the facility is targeted for a safety review.  Deficiencies found are corrected as soon as possible.\n\n"
