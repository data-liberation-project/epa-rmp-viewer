      "SummaryText": "The implementation of this Risk Management Program is designed to reduce, and ultimately prevent, the risk of accidental release of chlorine gas from 1 ton containers of liquified chlorine. The Bozeman Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine to sanitize the drinking water for the City of Bozeman. The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the WTP is 6, 1 ton containers, although only 1 container is on line at any one time. As noted in the following RMP the Water Treatment Plant personnel has come up with a plan to reduce the chance of any accidental release. First of all the WTP personnel will perform all duties relating to the handling of chlorine in the safest method available. Training in proper handling, maintenance of related equipment, and common sense will be the methods for meeting this first goal. Secondly, the WTP will work directly with the local Hazardous Materials Response Team to mitigate any accidental releases. The WTP has an Emergency Response Plan that includes mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery for the accidental release of chlorine. The plan includes continued development, a table top exercise, and a full scale exercise.\n\nAll should be aware, personal safety is the number one priority of a WTP operator. Only small chlorine leaks will be repaired by WTP personnel. Any chlorine leak in which the ERP will be implemented, requires the WTP is to be evacuated immediately. The ERP covers all aspects of the WTP personnel after evacuation including HAZMAT contact.\n\nThis RMP will be a continuously modified program. As WTP and HAZMAT personnel learn through their experience, the plan will be modified. Personal and public safety will be paramount. \n\nIn June 2004 the Bozeman WTP completed a Vulnerability Assessment, of which chlorine leaks were identified.\n\nIn December, the Water Treatment Plant completed a very extensive \"Emergency Response Plan\". Within the ERP is the RMP for chlorine emergencies."
