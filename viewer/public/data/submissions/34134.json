      "SummaryText": "Louis Dreyfus Citrus operates two covered processes which contain anhydrous ammonia in quantities greater than the corresponding threshold quantity.  The overall approach to accidental release prevention and emergency response is to inform all interested persons including employees, neighbors, and agencies that Louis Dreyfus Citrus complies with applicable local, state and federal regulations dealing with the risks involved with the storage, handling and use of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  The accident prevention program in place at this facility includes the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance; daily equipment inspections; testing an\n d replacement of equipment as necessary; reviewing, and updating as necessary, prevention program components prior to implementing changes to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.  \n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals or combination of these activities.  Our safety program prevents accidents because it focuses on the rules, procedures, training and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are reviewed and revised and modified as necessary.  They are communicated and accepted by all employees at this facility.\n\nLouis Dreyfus Citrus has not had any releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program at the Louis Dreyfus Citrus facility involves all employees.  Training is conducted in accordance with OSHA and industry standards.  Annual drills are conducted using both company and non-company personnel"
