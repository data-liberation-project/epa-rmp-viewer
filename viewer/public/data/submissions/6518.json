The prevention of occupationally induced injury or illness is of such consequence that it is given precedence over productivity whenever necessary.  Safety is every employee's job.\n\n(b)  Miesel/Sysco's Canton, Michigan facility distributes a wide variety of restaurant, commercial, and grocery products (primarily food).  Many of these products are cold stored in refrigerator or freezer rooms.  These rooms are cooled by anhydrous ammonia refrigeration.\n\n(c)  The worst case release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system would be a rupture of the system piping at or near its entrance to one of numerous evaporator units.  The alternative release scenario would be failure of the receiver tank pressure relief valve.\n\n(d) The prevention program includes a system with built-in safeguards including audible alarms which detect process conditions which would create emergency conditions.  In addition, process safety management procedures as required under the OSHA p"

      "SummaryText": "rocess safety management standard have been implemented.\n\n(e)  No reportable accidental releases have occurred in the last five years.\n\n(f)  Miesel/Sysco relies on the Canton Township Fire Department to respond to ammonia emergency release conditions.  Representatives of the Canton Fire Department have been trained and are members of the Western Wayne County Hazardous Materials Response Team.  In the event that ammonia emergency conditions the facility managers that have been trained in hazardous materials operations and emergency response techniques will begin incipient stage emergency response with the available emergency response equipment available at the site.\n\n(g)  Miesel/Sysco has a continuing program of employee involvement in safety management including a corporate-designed program known as SYSCOsafe.  Use of training programs, safety meetings, toolbox talks, and daily pre-shift meetings convey pertinent safety information related to ammonia operations.  Miesel/Sysco has implemented a detailed new employee orientation training program which addresses ammonia safety and emergency response."
