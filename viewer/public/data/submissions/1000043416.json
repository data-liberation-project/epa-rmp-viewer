      "SummaryText": "     NORPAC Foods, Inc. is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors.\n\nNORPAC uses anhydrous ammonia to freeze its fruits and vegetables.  The ammonia is stored on site in a liquid form.\n\n     NORPAC complies with rules, regulations, and recommendations from OSHA, ASME, IIAR, EPA, DEQ, PSM, etc.  NORPAC also keeps full time refrigeration engineering personnel on duty to monitor, operate, and maintain the equipment and process.  The refrigeration personnel receives on the job training as well as off site training dealing in the maintenance and safety of the equipment and of the process.\n\n     NORPAC Foods Salem Plant #7 has not had an ammonia release resulting in an off site consequence since the plant at 2325 Madrona Ave SE, Salem, OR, started using anhydrous ammonia in 1990.  NORPAC has set up emergency evacuation plans for the plant.  These plans would go into effect with the local emergency responders.\n\n     NORPAC uses safety committees, on the job training, safety seminars and safety training to identify and improve the overall safety at the facility."
