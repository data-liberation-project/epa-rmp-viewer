Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.

If such a failure released the maximum inventory of the tank (238,000 pounds), the HF acid would vaporize, resulting in a toxic exposure hazard in the downwind area that would extend outside of the boundary of the refinery. As specified by EPA, this analysis assumes that all of the HF acid is released to the air.\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances in RMP-covered processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion, involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing a flammable material mixture. The analysis assumes that the maximum possible inventory of 2,353,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Because there are some public receptor locations just outside the refinery property, this event could affect members of the public at those closest locations.\n\nThere are no Program 1 processes at the refinery; therefore, no additional worst-case analyses are reported in this risk management plan.  Also, we did not identify any worst-case scenarios that would affect public receptors other than the receptors affected by the scenarios reported above.\n\n\t\tAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe analyzed numerous release scenarios for toxic materials. The two toxic release scenarios we are reporting as part of the risk management plan involve HF acid and chlorine gas.  The alternate release scenario for HF acid in our risk management plan involves the failure of a tank truck unloading hose.  This would result in the release of 964 pounds of HF acid in the time required for the hose"

This would result in a release of 900 pounds of chlorine in the time required for the valve to be isolated and depressured, thereby stopping the release.  The analysis indicated that the resulting vapor cloud could result in toxic exposures to people outside the refinery boundary.\n\nThe alternative release scenario in our risk management plan for flammable substances at the refinery is the result of a failure of a propane transfer line. The line failure would release 101,000 pounds of flammable material in the time required to isolate and depressure the line. The analysis assumed that all of this material would be involved in a vapor cloud explosion and showed that the resulting overpressure from the explosion would affect public receptor locations outside the refinery.\n\nAs stated previously, we have included details regarding these scenarios in the additional information submitted to EPA with this executive summary, and have shared that information with the LEPC, other organizations involved in emergency planning, and members of the local community.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, incident investigation teams and compliance audit teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Ohio Refining Division accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ohio Refining Division and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include safety meetings and a health and safety committee to promote both process and personal safety. All division personnel attend the safety meetings and the health and safety committee has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, safety and division management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ohio Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process. When an employee is assigned process operation responsibility they receive basic process operator training.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nContractors\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Ohio Refining Division evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Ohio Refining Division personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Ohio Refining Division conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification. The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
