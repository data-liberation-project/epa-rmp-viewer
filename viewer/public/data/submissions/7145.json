Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia  which is considered hazardous by EPA. We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Hamlet Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority (Hamlet Fire Department) and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n    The facility is divided by the Burlington Northern Railroad, with anhydrous ammonia storage ( constructed in 1963) on the north and south side of the tracks.

This   facility has equipment for unloading transport trucks  and rail (connected to 18,000 gallon tank) and equipment to load nurse tanks and transports . Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, and authorized contractors. \n\n     The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is  anhydrous ammonia. \n\n       The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 297670 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be 457,670 pounds (includes 18,000 gallon tank coupled to rail car).\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and\nmitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n        Product: anhydrous ammonia\n     Worst case Scenario: Release of the total contents of the 18,000  gallon ammonia tank filled to 85% maximum and 100 ton capacity rail car filled to 80% capacity would be released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 240,000  pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.45 miles.\n      Alternative Release Scenario: Based on a potential incident of the rupture of a 2 inch hose during product transfer. The distance to the endpoint  (point of 200 ppm dispersion) is .56 miles. The amount of anhydrous ammonia released would be 11908 pounds. *Note: we are using this alternative instead of an actual release which occurred in 1998, due to the small amount of product lost and minimal off-site movement of the product. We felt that the model  more represented a realistic release.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis distribution facility com"

The facility's  anhydrous ammonia plant has  implemented the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; periodic inspections by the Indiana State Chemists Office are also conducted. Employees involved in anhydrous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by our Safety Coordinator, contractor and insurance companies, and industry experts; an annual formal refresher course as well as periodic training is also provided.  \n  The major hazards identified with anhydrous ammonia include toxic release, stress corrosion, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n  Mitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia. In addition,  passive mitigation systems limiting the filling of tanks to 85% capacity (through tank gauges and onsite personnel) are utilized.\n  Employees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation.\n   Maintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date,  or if a system or process is changed or upgraded. OSHA 1910.111 standards are used to identify those needs. The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment"

In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\n\n\n5. Five-year accident history. \n\nOn April 7, 1998,  an incident involving the failure of a valve attachment on an ammonia hose caused an 8 minute gas/vapor release of 436 pounds. An employee was injured (inhalation) and hospitalized for 6 days. The release dissipated quickly due to high wind conditions and although there was off-site movement, the release caused no additional damage, injuries, or evacuations. R. C. Smith of the Indiana State Chemist' s Office investigated the incident and determined that the valve had been manufactured improperly. This accident prompted a review of maintenance programs, training, and emergency response.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 1910.38. We have  coordinated response actions with the Hamlet Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training. We have discussed this program with the\nStarke County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and our  facility is included in the county emergency plan. In the event of a release of regulated substances, our employees have been instructed on the  procedures for notification of the local fire authority (Hamlet) fire department, emergency personnel,  and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt his facility, safety improvement is an ongoing process.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. This facility is  in compliance with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 standard and the ANSI K-61.1 standard. The Indiana State Chemist is also in the process of reviewing and updating their requirements for bulk anhydrous ammonia storage facilities.
