Plant (America's Catch), Itta Bena, Mississippi has anhydrous ammonia on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. America's Catch has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for America's Catch utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium. Anhydrous ammonia is the only highly hazardous chemical above the threshold quantity on-site.  The System contains high stage compressors and low stage compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling and water cooled oil coolers on their compressors.\r\n\r\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory of 25,099 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, includes high stage recirculators which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release and the alternate release scenarios are delineated below.  EPA's RMP*Comp was used in the consequence analyses. The worst case release is calculated to be a complete release of the contents of the largest vessel. The largest vessel at AmericaA\u00bfs Catch is the high pressure receiver. The high pressure receiver is located outdoors and has a maximum storage capacity of 14,210 pounds of ammonia.  If this vessel was severely damaged, it would release the entire contents of the storage tank. \r\n\r\nWorst Case\r\nChemical and Amount Released:14,210 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in"

The 2010 federal census shows the town of Itta Bena and the surrounding land to contain approximately 34 people per square mile.  Review of aerial photographs and visual surveys of the area showed very little residential development in the area of the facility. Therefore, a complete failure of the ammonia system would be unlikely to affect any off site receptors. \r\n\r\nAlternate Case\r\nChemical and Amount Released:500 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes inside the Ammonia  Room during system maintenance.\r\nWeather Conditions:77 A\u00baF with a 6.7 mph wind in Class D atmospheric stability.\r\n\r\nThis release would affect a 0.1 mile radius from the center of the facility and have no offsite impact around AmericaA\u00bfs Catch; it would affect the 350 full-time employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nAmerica's Catch is in compliance with OSHA PSM and emergency action plan regulations, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 rules.  The regularly scheduled maintenance program is key to maintaining the America's Catch Refrigeration System in good operation.\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases at America's Catch during the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe equipment listed below is inspected daily.\r\n\r\nall refrigeration compressors\r\nall ammonia pumps\r\nall condensers\r\nall ice houses\r\nall heat exchangers\r\nall spiral freezers\r\n\r\nShould there be an ammonia release that requires assistance, the Itta Bena, Mississippi Fire Department (IBFD) will respond.
