This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes.  The Boise Packaging and Newsprint, LLC (Boise) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nBoise Packaging and Newsprint, LLC owns and operates the DeRidder Paper Mill (the Mill) located in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana.  The Mill produces linerboard products.  The Mill purchases pine wood grown in the region, chips the timber, utilizes chemical methods to produce pulp from wood fibers and processes the pulp into linerboard products.  Methods used in the pulping process include cutting, debarking, chipping, cooking, and washing.  \r\n\r\nChanges to facility processes have been evaluated to determine if any new regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeding the threshold quantity would be brought into the Mill.  Based on process knowledge of the changes, the DeRidder Mill did not identify any listed flammable substances due to the process changes.  Chlorine is stored on site above the threshold quantity and is used for mill water treatment.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nChlorine is stored above the threshold quantity at the Mill.  In addition, the chlorine system is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the DeRidder Paper Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances"

The ERPG-2 for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\r\n\r\nThe following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tRelease rate dependent upon scenario;\r\n\u00b7\tUse of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\r\n\u00b7\tActual release height; and\r\n\u00b7\tConsideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\r\n\r\nFlammable Substances\r\n\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances is not required.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the RMP program.

The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\nEmployees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Mill facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Mill is coordinated with the Beauregard Parish, Louisiana, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which involves local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. \r\nThe Mill has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \r\nIn addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Mill conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Mill provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process.

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans and, (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.\r\nAnother integral part of mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Mill incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic su"

      "SummaryText": ".  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\r\nThe Mill keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \r\nThe Mill also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThe Mill uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": "ementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown, (4) normal shutdown, (5) initial startup of a new process, and (6) emergency operation and start up after emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed.  The review process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or f"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as operating/management procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Mill promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in a fire or explosion, a toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the DeRidder Paper Mill periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and"
