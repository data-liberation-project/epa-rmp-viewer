      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination.  The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (MDWASD) Alexander Orr Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and aqueous ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in finished drinking water, to protect public health and to comply with state and federal water quality standards.  \n\nStoring and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The Alexander Orr WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals seriously, as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine handling processes is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and an update to the RMP every five (5) years.  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the chlorine process, including a description of the possible consequences if the procedures are not followed, and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of a chlorine release.\n\nThe following information is provided below in this RMP Executive Summary:\nA?    Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.\nA?    General Facility and regulated substance information.\nA?    Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chem"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven chlorine process technology and safety systems, incorporates staff training, provides detailed information on the hazards of chlorine and process safety management, implements operation and maintenance standard operating procedures, trains and plans for emergency response and emergency actions, includes contractor safety, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance information\nThe MDWASD Alexander Orr WTP is located at 6800 SW 87 Avenue, Miami, Florida. The plant is bounded by SW 64th Street, to the North, and by SW 72nd Street (Sunset Dr.) to the South. Alexander Orr WTP covers 68 acres.  The facility stores chlorine which is a regulated toxic substance under RMP rule.\n\n\nAlexander Orr WTP has two chlorine facilities designated as Chemical Plan One and Chemical Plant 2. Chlorine is delivered in 90-ton rail cars to a chlorine car enclosure. The 90-ton rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure. The chlorine system currently supplies a total of approximately 4500 pounds per day to Plant 1 and 2900 pounds per day to Plant 2. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Alexander Orr WTP at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the RMP rule. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in Process Safety Management Standard.\n\nThe pressure from the stored chlorine in the rail car forces liquid chlorine through the tubing and into the chlorine feed line. During normal operation liquid chlorine flows from the rail cars through the chlorine pipeline to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The "

      "SummaryText": "evaporators are equipped with high and low temperature alarms, to ensure that normal temperature is maintained. Chlorine gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas Rotometer and v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile Iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe Alexander Orr WTP chlorine systems are provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  Safety features include, but are not limited to emergency shut-off valves, chlorine leak detectors, audio and visual alarm system, isolation valves, high and low temperature alarms, high and low pressure alarms, pressure regulators, expansion tanks, bursting disks, and pressure relief valves.  Chlorine Kit A?CA? and personal protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus are available in the event of a chlorine release.  These major safety features are located in the chlorine car enclosure and the chlorinator room.\n\nEmergency shut-off valves are located immediately after the rail car valve. Downstream of the manifold system there is also a pneumatically actuated emergency shut-off valve.  Pulling one of the emergency shut-off switches (kill switches) activates the emergency shut-off valves.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure and in the chlorinator room.  \n\nThe emergency shut-off valves in the chlorinator room are the same as those located in the chlorine car enclosure.  The valves are located on the liquid chlorine supply lines that enter the chlorinator room.  As with the valves in the chlorine car enclosure, the shut-off valves in the control room are operated manually "

Additional manually-operated isolation valves are located throughout the chlorine system.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine car enclosure is activated when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audio and visual alarms are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are engaged, personnel are restricted from entering the chlorine area without the appropriate personnel protective equipment.  A chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator rooms.  \n\nA perimeter fence and locked security gates surround the Alexander Orr WTP. Security guards are posted at the entrances to the plant and at the chlorine storage area, and unauthorized access is not allowed.  The Plant operates three shifts employees onsite 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\n The Alexander Orr WTP is also provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power to the entire facility.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Alexander Orr WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nA?
