A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events\n\n1  20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n7 The Smith's Food & Drug Distribution Center stores and distributes refrigerated and non-refrigerated foods   Storage requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n7 The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia\n7 The ammonia refrigeration syste"
