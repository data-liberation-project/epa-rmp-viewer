      "SummaryText": "The Lubbock, Texas Ice manufacturing facility originally submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA in 1999 under the name \"Host Ice.\"  At that time it was believed the facility was subject to Program 1 requirements.  Upon further investigation, it was determined that the facility actually falls under Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe Lubbock facility was acquired from Host Ice by Arctic Group, Inc. and operates as Arctic Glacier Ice.  However, the facility is still referred to as Host Ice by some local entities.  \n\nThe Arctic Glacier Ice facility is located at 130 E 42nd Street; Lubbock, Texas 79404.  The facility produces ice and utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the ice making process.  The facility has three main anhydrous ammonia storage tanks on site with a total storage capacity of 16,000 lbs.  The facility is classified as Program 3 because the identified process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility is now submitting this revised RMP under the name Arctic Glacier Ice for agency review.  \n\nPursuant to RMP requirements, a worst-case and alternative scenario was evaluated, resulting in the distance to the toxic endpoint being 1.32 miles and 0.1 miles for the worst-case and alternative scenario, respectively."
