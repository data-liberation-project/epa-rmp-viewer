      "SummaryText": "El Yunque Filtration Plant is located at the State Road 995 Blasina Sector, Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, 00745.  This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason El Yunque Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve safety and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nEl Yunque Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from San Juan Chlorine Warehouse and Distribution Center (PRASA) in one (1) ton containers.  El Yunque Filtration Plant could have a storage maximum volume of 32,000 pounds distributed in sixteen (16) containers.  The containers are placed inside a chlortainer and external tubing are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water sent two (2) different injections points along the process of the plant. \r\n\r\nAlso, El Yunque Filtration Plant has a chlorine cylinders warehouse.  The warehouse stores approximately 30 cylinders of 150 pounds of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "located in a room next to the one ton containers area.  The warehouse is equipped with extractors, area detectors, specialized tool kits and equipment to appropriately manage the cylinders.  The purpose of the warehouse it to distribute chlorine cylinders to other plants and pump stations in the east region. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Marplot and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 7,161 public receptors are inside the 1.3 miles radio.  Environmental receptors (river) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 pounds container, but throughout a valve rupture.  This case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and 36 public receptors were identified over the most recent map. No known environmental receptors are located within this radio area.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \r\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive operation to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenance and mechanical integrity of the facility which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep a"

List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOPs to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\nFive years Accident History:\r\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nPRASA has already implemented in El Yunque Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage."
