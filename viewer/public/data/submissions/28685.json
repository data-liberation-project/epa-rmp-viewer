Box 79, Mendon, Mo.\nContact:     Valerie Gladbach\nPhone:     660-272-3213\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n    AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC, and the employees of the AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC in Mendon are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Mendon Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also handles pesticides, grain, feed and farm supply.\n\n    This plan does include predictive filing as railroad tank cars may be onsite. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 650,814 pounds. The facility has (1) 12,000 gallon storage tank, and the largest tank onsite would be a railroad tank car containing approximately 162,563 pounds. There may be occasions where multiple railroad tank cars would be located at the facility. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a railroad tank car holding approximately 162,563 pounds. The facility also has (24) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks and (2) 335-gallon applicator tanks for product distribution.  \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 162,563 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n    \n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on"

      "SummaryText": " the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,638 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia Law and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n    7/10/03"
