              "Description": "The Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Process is made up of two units.  The Butadiene Hydrogenation Unit (BHU) removes butadiene from the MTBE reactor feed, the MTBE Reaction and Purification Unit produces and purifies MTBE and byproducts.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The most recent HAZOP (03/26/2004) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the MTBE Unit.  The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows:  The deluge system is used on all pumps and accumulators in the MTBE Reaction and Purification Unit.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

              "Description": "The Butadiene Process is made up of five units.  The Acetylene Hydrogenation Unit (AHU) removes acetylenes from the crude butadiene feed, the Butadiene Purification Unit purifies butadiene products and byproducts, the Sponge Oil Unit recovers C4s from the Vent Gas System and depentanizer bottoms streams, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems collect off-gas for recovery and/or combustion in an elevated flare, and the Waste Water Stripper Unit removes process chemicals from the process water.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The most recent HAZOP (04/25/2003) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the AHU. The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows: Interlocks are used in the Butadiene Purification Unit, the AHU, the Flare and Vent Gas Systems, and the W3F54 Wastewater Stripper.  Automatic shut-offs are in the AHU, Butadiene Purification Unit, and Flare and Vent Gas Systems.  The deluge system is only used on all pumps and accumulators in the BD portion of the process and on the accumulator in the vent recovery system.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

This area also includes storage of finished product for the O&O Plant F5 Unit.  Several HAZOPs were conducted in order to cover all of the equipment in this process.  The most recent HAZOP (02/12/2004) which is listed in this report covered the equipment in the MTBE storage area. The process controls, mitigation, monitors and detection systems noted apply to all units except as follows:  Only butadiene tanks have rupture disks.  Automatic shutoffs are on all electric pumps only.  Excess flow devices are only located at the truck and rail car loading racks.  The docks are not covered by perimeter monitors.  Deluge systems are used on 11 pumps and underneath the docks.  Interlocks are only used on the finished butadiene product sphere.  Note that the flammable mixture quantity listed in Section 1.17 for this process only includes RMP chemicals present in this process in less than reportable quantities and non-RMP flammables.",

Huntsman's C4 Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its associates and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the C4 Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) VPP Star award for excellence in safety performance. The C4 Plant maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management  (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   The C-4 Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety. Huntsman has participated in the past with the Responsible Care? initiative ACC, is committed to the responsible management of chemicals and is an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.   The C4 Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The C4 Plant is located  at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products butadiene and Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE).  Butadiene is a monomer used in the production of butadiene rubber and various butadiene co-polymers.  MTBE is a gasoline additive that increa"

      "SummaryText": "ses the oxygen content in order to reduce emissions and improves the octane rating.  MTBE is not an RMP chemical. \n\nThe C4 Plant processes or stores volumes of the following regulated flammable substances greater than the threshold amounts:  1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methylpropene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-butene-cis, butane, ethane, isobutane, isopentane, methane, pentane, propane, propylene, propyne, 2-butene-trans, vinyl acetylene and ethyl acetylene. The only regulated toxic substance, in a quantity greater than the threshold amount, at the time of this submittal of the Risk Management Plan is chlorine. \n\nThe C4 stationary source is composed of four processes. They are identified as the Butadiene Process, the MTBE Process, Receiving, Storage, and Transfer (RS&T) and Steam, Power and Water (SP&W).\n\nThe Butadiene Process produces butadiene by extraction and distillation of crude butadiene purchased from various olefin plants. This process also produces a by-product stream (Raffinate-1) which contains isobutylene and is used as a feedstock for the MTBE process.\n\nThe MTBE Process uses a catalytic method to react isobutylene with methanol to produce MTBE. The feeds to the MTBE Process are the Raffinate-1 stream from the Butadiene Process and butane/butylene streams from several refinery operations. The MTBE is then purified by distillation and sold to refineries.\n\nThe Receiving, Storage & Transfer (RS&T) Process consists of storage tanks, marine docks, and railcar facilities for,  loading, unloading and storage of raw materials, intermediates, by-products and finished products.\n\nThe SP&W Process consists of utilities, including raw water treatment, steam boilers, wastewater treatment and cooling towers. The only part of the SP&W Process which is covered by PSM and RMP is that area which contains chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders and utilized for water treatment.
