Huntsman  has a written emergency response program which encompasses the C4 Plant and contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a hazardous chemical.  These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training for emergency response employees who perform emergency response duties and local emergency responders who may be called to assist in emergency response.   The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested and inspected periodically. Huntsman is actively involved with informing local officials about hazardous substances stored and processed on site.  Huntsman  participates with the Jefferson County LEPC and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data sheets for participating companies.  The Team Leader of Emergency Response is the person to contact in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Coordinator for the plant is the designated alternate contact.

This process also produces a by-product stream (Raffinate-1) which contains isobutylene and is used as a feedstock for the MTBE process.\n\nThe MTBE Process uses a catalytic method to react isobutylene with methanol to produce MTBE. The feeds to the MTBE Process are the Raffinate-1 stream from the Butadiene Process and butane/butylene streams from several refinery operations. The MTBE is then purified by distillation and sold to refineries.\n\nThe Receiving, Storage & Transfer (RS&T) Process consists of storage tanks, marine docks, and railcar facilities for,  loading, unloading and storage of raw materials, intermediates, by-products and finished products.\n\nThe SP&W Process consists of utilities, including raw water treatment, steam boilers, wastewater treatment and cooling towers. The only part of the SP&W Process which is covered by PSM and RMP is that area which contains chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in cylinders and utilized for water treatment.  Although the bulk of the SP&W process is not covered, the C4 Plant is in the p"

Huntsman's C4 Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its associates and neighbors.  This is exemplified by the C4 Plant having earned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) VPP Star award for excellence in safety performance. The C4 Plant maintains a working OSHA Process Safety Management  (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has been built upon this existing PSM program.   The C-4 Plant participates with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) Sabine-Neches Chiefs Association and the Port Neches Fire Department in assisting local officials in the development of emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with them.   The facility complies with all applicable codes and standards regarding operating and equipment safety. Huntsman has participated in the past with the Responsible Care\u00ae initiative ACC, is committed to the responsible management of chemicals and is an active participant in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9002 quality management program.   The C4 Plant Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled. The C4 Plant is located  at the corner of Highway 136 and Highway 366 in Port Neches, Texas. The site began production in 1943 and was acquired by Huntsman in 1994.  The site produces as primary end products butadiene and Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE).  Butadiene is a monomer used in the production of butadiene rubber and various butadiene co-polymers.  MTBE is a gasoline additive that increa"

      "SummaryText": "rocess of implementing various elements of PSM/RMP for this area, including Management of Change, Operating Procedures and Mechanical Integrity.   \n\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that the C4 Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA in the RMP Rule, as well as, with the OSHA PSM standard.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe C4 Plant maintains a compilation of written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the covered process and the equipment in the covered process.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe C4 Plant has performed initial process hazard analysis to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The C4 Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying, evaluating, and addressing hazards in the process.  Employees are assigned to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which are further evaluated and implemented where beneficial.  Recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  The hazards imposed by hurricanes and inclement weather are minimally discussed during PHA's since this issue is well-covered by our Hurricane Preparedness Plan and Corporate Standards require designing equipment/structures to withstand high winds.\n \nOperating Procedures\nThe C4 Plant maintains written operating procedures, that were developed by operations, and provide clear instructions for safely operating covered processes.  These operating procedures are available to all employees who work in the processes.  The procedures are reviewed annually and modified whenever needed to accommodate operational and process changes.\n \nTraining\nThe C"
