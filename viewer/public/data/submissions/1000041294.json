      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\n\n\nOMNOVA Solutions Inc. (\"OMNOVA\") acquired the Akron, Ohio facility from Eliokem Inc. in December 2010. The Akron facility has been manufacturing synthetic polymers via emulsion polymerization since 1941. Primary products include wet latex and dry resins. OMNOVA uses substances which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"USEPA\") and has developed a Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"). Risk Management Plans are required when a toxic or flammable chemical is present on-site above its USEPA threshold. Under RMP, OMNOVA created scenarios to estimate the potential impact on the community in the unlikely event of an accidental chemical release. OMNOVA is near Joy Park, which is a recreational area located on Kelly Avenue to the west of the Akron facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nOMNOVA's Akron facility is strongly committed to the safety of its employees, its neighbors and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by its comprehensive RMP and process safety management (\"PSM\") programs, which cover processes at the facility including, but not limited to, equipment design and installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training. It is OMNOVA's policy to implement appropriate safeguards and controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances. However, if such a release were to occur, the facility has coordinated with the Akron Fire Department and Akron HazMat team to provide emergency response services.\n\n\n\nOMNOVA is committed to the principles of Responsible Care&reg; and the continual improvement of its safety, health, environmental and security programs. The facility has successfully implemented the Responsible Care&reg; Management System (\"RCMS\") to guide the facility in the implementation and management of its safety, health, environmental and security performance goals.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Akron facility stores and proces"

      "SummaryText": "ses two RMP-regulated substances above threshold levels: acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene. Both of these regulated substances are used as raw materials for latex and resin products. Acrylonitrile is regulated as a toxic substance; 1,3-butadiene is regulated as a flammable substance.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe Akron facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements found in 40 CFR Part 68. A number of processes at the facility are also subject to the OSHA PSM standards found at 29 CFR 1910.119. The Akron facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following paragraphs briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Akron facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Akron facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design data associated with the covered process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nThe Akron facility has conducted comprehensive process hazards analyses (\"PHAs\") to ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and either eliminated or minimized. The methodology usually used to complete PHAs is the Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) analysis. In the case of relatively simple changes to the covered process, a \"What if\" PHA is sometimes used. The studies are completed by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated as required. Any findings or recommendations related to the PHA are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely and consistently conducting activities within the covered process, the Akron facility has developed and maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including, but not limited to, initial startup, normal operations, and startup a"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible by operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Akron facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who operate the various processes are knowledgeable of and competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided every three years, or more frequently if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nThe Akron facility conducts and documents maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure it operates safely. Process equipment included in maintenance checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by fully trained and qualified employees and contractors. Employees complete specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Akron Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and other employees whose job tasks are affected by changes to the covered process are promptly informed of the proposed changes and are trained to safely perform their jobs after the changes have been implemented.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of existing processes are conducted before the new or modified processes are started up. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are complete and suitable for safe startup prior to placing new or modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Akron facility conducts periodic audits to determine whether the provisions established under the RMP rule are being fully and properly i"

These audits are conducted at least every three years, and any deficiencies or recommendations identified during the audits are addressed through corrective actions that are completed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Akron facility promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are conducted to identify immediate and basic (root) causes, as well as to identify corrective actions necessary to prevent the incident from recurring. Incident reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nProcess safety management and accidental release prevention at the Akron facility are team efforts. Employees are encouraged to participate in the MOC process, PHAs, and PSSRs as they relate to specific processes and to recommend improvements to the programs. Employees have access to all information generated as part of the facility's implementation of process safety management and the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nContractors \n\nOn occasion, the Akron facility utilizes contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Contractors are informed of known potential safety hazards that could affect the contractor's work, as well as the hazards of the chemicals in use at the facility. Contractors also receive training in the facility's emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nFive year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Akron facility has not experienced any accidental chemical releases in the last five years which meet the RMP definition.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe Akron facility has developed a written emergency response plan that addresses accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. The plan covers all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, facility evacuation, notification of local emergency"

The plan is updated as needed if any aspects relating to emergency response change. The Summit County LEPC is the agency with which the emergency response plan has been coordinated.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nBecause of the age of the Akron facility, OMNOVA's senior management approved a major project in 2013 to move all latex and resin manufacturing operations to the nearby Mogadore, Ohio facility. The project will result in the permanent shutdown of all raw material storage tanks, transfer piping and reactors at the Akron facility that are currently subject to the RMP rules. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2015. The only processes that will remain at the Akron facility are the resin coagulation and drying systems, which are not subject to the RMP rules.\n\n"
