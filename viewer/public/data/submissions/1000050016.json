The Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Kensal Farmers Elevator Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance, and training of all persons that work with the material. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has coordinated with the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for a response to any release and minimize the impact of a release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\r\n\r\n3. The worst case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons. The alternate case release scenario is not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\r\n\r\n4. The Accidental Release Program: Kensal Farmers Elevator Co. complies with North Dakota Title 7-12 relating to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations administered by the Department of Insurance are consistent with CGA G-2.1 (previously ANSI K61.1) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\n6. The Emergency Response Program: Kensal Farmers Elevator Co. has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authorities emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title II"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
