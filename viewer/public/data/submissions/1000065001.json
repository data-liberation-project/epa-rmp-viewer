Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThis facility handles chlorine which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe facility treats surface water obtained from reservoirs for municipal and industrial uses.  This water is disinfected by mixing chlorine gas and water.  There are facilities to utilize three (3) one ton containers of chlorine on-line,  three (3) one ton containers of chlorine on standby, and storage for six (6) one ton containers of chlorine in the Chlorine Storage Room of the Operations Building.  Chlorine gas from the on-line containers is piped into the chlorinators located in the Instrumentation Room, which is next door to the Chlorine Storage Room.  The chlorine gas is piped from the chlorinators down to the water injectors in the Basement Room of the Operations Building which is below the Chlorine Storage room and Instrumentation Room.\r\n\r\nThere is a daily maximum of 24,000 lb of chlorine at the facility.\r\n\r\n3a. Administrative Controls\r\n\r\nAdministrative control to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine system and the training provided to the chlorine system operators.\r\n\r\n3b."

      "SummaryText": "Mitigation Measures\r\n\r\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing,  and maintenance of the chlorine system and its related equipment and components. In addition, a scrubber system is provided which will neutralize an accidental spill of chlorine before it is released to atmosphere.\r\n\r\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n5. Seismic Assessment\r\n\r\nA seismic assessment was conducted for the chlorination system at the facility.  A professional civil engineer performed a site visit on March 16, 2017 to walk down the system.  As a result of the assessment, three (3) recommendations were proposed:\r\n\r\nS01 - Replace the missing chain link safety hook at the North Standby Rack for the backup chlorine\r\none ton container storage. (see Figure 3 below)\r\n\r\nS02 - Tighten the loose bolt nut at the South Standby Rack for the backup chlorine one ton container\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nS03 - The bolt nut at the South Standby Rack for the backup one ton container storage does not have\r\nenough thread. Add a new threaded rod anchor with epoxy next to the existing anchor.\r\n\r\nAll three recommendations were subsequently reviewed and implemented by the District.\r\n\r\n6. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere were no accidental releases of chlorine during the last five-year period. \r\n\r\n7. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alertin"

The County of San Joaquin - Office of Emergency Services can incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \r\n\r\n8. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\r\n\r\nChanges have been made to the chlorine system and its operation based on recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audits, and Seismic Reviews.  All recommended changes have been reviewed and implemented.  There are no additional changes planned at this time.  The system will be further reviewed and new updates proposed as the RMP is implemented."
