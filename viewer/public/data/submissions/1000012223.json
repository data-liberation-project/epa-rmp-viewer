It is the policy of the Utilities Division to operate the wastewater treatment facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most sufficient manner possible, with due regard for the health and safety of Utilities Division employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\nThe City of Cumberland Wastewater Treatment Plant employs gaseous chlorine for the disinfection of the wastewater.  Sulfur dioxide gas is used to de-chlorinate the treated effluent prior to discharge to the environment.  This is considered to be a single continuous process.\n\nThe gasses are delivered, stored and drawn from one-ton containers.  The gasses are liquefied by the pressure in the containers and gas is drawn from the vapor layer at the top of the container.  The Emergency Response Plan has been in existence sin some form since 1990 ? the plan has underwent numerous revisions with the latest being August 2007, and is coordinated with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nThe worst case scenario for the Wastewater Treatment Plant assumes the Environmental Protection Agency mandated elements as defined in 40 CFR 68.  The basis for the calculation is the release of one ton (2,000 lbs) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide during 10 minutes at 0 feet elevation and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with an atmospheric stability class F.  This is a very stable atmosphere with the highest temperature recorded for Cumberland. \n\nThe alternative scenario assumes a break in the gas withdrawal tubing at the ton container connectio"

      "SummaryText": "n, a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (the maximum temperature at the closest reporting station), and an atmospheric stability class of D.  Procedures prohibit lifting containers over in-service containers reducing the likelihood of breaking multiple lines.  All container changes are done during normal duty hours on weekdays.  This scenario also assumes the failure of the vacuum-controlled chlorine regulators.\n\nRelease Prevention\nThe general release prevention program is based on training, standard operating procedures, materials selection, and automatic shut-off flow control valves.  The operating personnel are trained in the proper maintenance, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Emergency shut-off valves were installed and are mounted directly on the container outlet.  With regard to chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the two chemicals are similar enough that the operations are essentially the same.\nAll gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material compatibility and Codes and Standards compliance.  The systems are regularly and routinely inspected and maintenance is performed as appropriate.\n\nAccident History\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant did have a release of 200 pounds of chlorine on October 30, 1997.  There were two employees transported to a local hospital as a precautionary measure.  The accidental release resulted in no damage on-site and there were no off-site consequences.  The accident resulted in improvements to the gas removal equipment, revised Standard Operating Procedures and revised training for operators.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n The Emergency Response Program is based on the use of Utilities Division WWTP employees who are trained to respond to, and control an accidental release of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The employees are trained in the use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment and specialized ton-container patching k"
