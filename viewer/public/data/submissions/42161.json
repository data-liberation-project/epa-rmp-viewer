It is the chlorine in ton cylinders that is used to disinfect the effluent from the facility. A wastewater treament plant treat raw wastewater through a series of biological processes to remove solids, ammonia and other typical substances found in domestic sewage. After achieving removal of 90% of the solids, the clear effluent is disinfected with a chlorine and water mixture before discharging into abody of water.\n            The risk of a chlorine leak is minimized by several activities. First, the cylinders are in a separate building that is continually monitored bya chlorine aram that tones into a central station. The centtral station is Monroe County Control Center. This Control Center is manned 24/7 365. The staff has all emergency contact information.\n              The chlorine is checked on a daily basis be certified wastewater operators. They have received training both from the Commonwealth and through safety meetings regarding chlroine gas. On site is a one ton cyclinder repair fit and self contained breathing apparatus to effect any repair that is necessary.\n              An accidental release emergency response plan is located on site as well as the Borough Office. This plan deals with the response to a catastrophic release. It has in decending order of importance whom to contact. A copy is on file with the Monroe County LEPC who is one of the first to be contacted by this plan.\n              There has been no accidental release in the last five years. One reason is that these cylinders are tested by the supplier to meet the chlorine institute's requirments for safety. For instance, the valves are always checked and refurbished before they are installed on newly filled tanks.\n              Discussion is ongoing with the Chief Operator to see if we can change our operation to be below the"
