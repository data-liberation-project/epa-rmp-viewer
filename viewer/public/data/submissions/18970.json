Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Cagle's - Keystone Foods are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Clinton County Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around slaughtering, and processing poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane are the two regulated substances present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.  The propane is used as a fuel for the facility.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 23,266 pounds.  The maximum propane inventory would be 111,000 pounds stored in a 30,000 gallon (water capacity) vessel.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 7,127 "

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Storage Tank in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 400 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.20 miles.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios for propane, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane Receiver in the Propane process.  The scenario involves the release of 111,000 pounds of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.39 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane Receiver in the Propane process.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 18,951 pounds of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n4.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If-Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cagle's - Keystone Foods maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with each process.\n\nTraining\nCagle's - Keystone Foods has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with each process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCagle's -"

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Cagle's - Keystone Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nCagle's - Keystone Foods has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last year (this is a new facility built in 1998).  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nCagle's - Keystone Foods has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.
