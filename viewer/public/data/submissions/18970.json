      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Cagle's - Keystone Foods are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Clinton County Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around slaughtering, and processing poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia and propane are the two regulated substances present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.  The propane is used as a fuel for the facility.\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 23,266 pounds.  The maximum propane inventory would be 111,000 pounds stored in a 30,000 gallon (water capacity) vessel.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves a catastrophic release from ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 7,127 "

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia involves a release from Storage Tank in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 400 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.20 miles.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios for propane, we have used Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane Receiver in the Propane process.  The scenario involves the release of 111,000 pounds of Propane.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.39 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane Receiver in the Propane process.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 18,951 pounds of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 PSI overpressure is 0.2 miles.\n\n\n4.
