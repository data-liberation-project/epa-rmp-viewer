      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n1.1  Introduction\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  The RMP contains a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical may be subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate worst case and alternative case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.  Finally, the covered facility must make their risk management program available to the public.  This document is part of the Rohm and Haas Hayward Plant's RMP communication effort.\n\nThis document comprises the RMP plan for the Rohm and Haas Company Hayward Plant.  The plan contains a description of all the procedures and provisions to reduce the likelihood and severity of an RMP regulated substance release or accident.  The RMP plan is based upon a complete assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures of the plant and an analysis of potential releases of RMP regulated substances that may occur at the plant and their impacts on the offsite populations.\n\n \n1.2  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nRohm and Haas Hayward Plant has a long standing commitment to provide a safe workplace and to prevent accidental releases.  This commitment is set forth in Rohm and Haas environmental, health and safety policies:\n \n*  We will ensure our worldwide operations and products are free from significant risks to the health and safety of our employees, customers, carriers, distributors, the general public, and to the environment.\n \n*  We will meet or exceed all applicable laws and regulations, participate in voluntary initiatives such as Responsible"

We have formal programs to verify our facility is being operated in accordance with accepted industry practices, company standards and legal requirements.\n \n The types of risk management programs required by the RMP have long been in place at Rohm and Haas Hayward.  Safe operation is a plant and company priority, and is reflected in policies as well as everyday activities.  We welcome the EPA's RMP initiative and see it as an opportunity to expand dialog with our community and to help us improve our safety performance.\n  \n \n1.3  General Description of the Stationary Source\n The Rohm and Haas Hayward Plant is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility that produces a variety of non-hazardous water-based polymeric emulsions.  This activity is described by SIC code 2821 and NAICS code 325211.  Approximately sisty different products are manufactured at the plant using different mixtures of reactants.  These products are used by our customers to manufacture water-based paints, floor polishes, adhesives, caulks, and other household and industrial products.\n \n The Rohm and Haas facility is located in the city of Hayward, California at 25500 Whitesell Street near the intersection of State Highway 92 and Clawiter.  The plant is constructed on a parcel of approximately 33 acres at the corner of Whitesell Street and Breakwater Avenue.  The northern portion of the prope"

This plan provides the requirements for evacuation of the facility; notification of emergency responders, agency contacts and industrial neighbors; emergency first aid or medical treatment for human exposure; coordination of the in-house Incident Command System; use of personal protective equipment; response to specific events (including external events such as earthquakes); and reporting and notification procedures.\n \n Rohm and Haas personnel are trained on and familiar with these procedures in order to allow the facility to respond safely and properly to accidental chemical releases.  Numerous facility personnel have been trained as on-site incident commanders assigned the responsibility of coordinating the Plant response to any incident which may occur including communicating response needs with the local Fire Department responders.  An incident commander is on duty at the Plant 24 hours per day.   The Plant Emergency Response Team annually conducts 20 hands-on drills, including quarterly testing of Plantwide emergency alarm systems, an annual Plant evacuation drill, and actual response to Plant emergency scenarios.  All Plant employees are trained on the relevant aspects of the emergency response plan.  Rohm and Haas has participated in City of Hayward Disaster Exercises and makes the plant and its equipment available to local emergency responders for training exercises.  Plant personnel are actively involved in the local Community Awareness and Emergency Response group. \n \n \n1.9  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt is our belief that effective environmental, health, and safety systems must be continually improved.  We constantly strive to recognize areas for improvement and implement the changes necessary to achieve our goals.

The southern portion of the property is undeveloped, with the exception of approximately 3 acres that are leased to Trimac Transportation Services.  Trimac operates a dedicated truck terminal exclusively for Rohm and Haas products.  Railroad spurs border the eastern and northern edges of the property and a series of treated wastewater sand filters is located at the northwest corner of the property.\n \n The polymeric emulsions are produced in two parallel process units.  All of the products are manufactured in batch operations.  The major raw materials used are monomers, and are received by railcar, tank truck or deck tank.  Each of these major raw materials is stored in a dedicated tank with a dedicated pump that is used to unload the railcar, tank truck or deck tank, and to feed the raw material to the process. \n \n Once raw materials are transferred to the Process Building, they are typically pumped to either a mix tank for preliminary mixing with other raw materials and additives, or directly into an emulsion tank where they are mixed with additives.  From there, the emulsion mixture is sent to the reactor where the catalyst and activators are added to initiate the reaction.  When the reaction is essentially complete, the emulsion goes to drain tanks where additives may be introduced and the pH of the emulsion is adjusted.  Bactericides are also added to prevent bacterial growth and resulting product degradation.  The emulsion is then pumped through filters into the product storage tanks.  The products are shipped out of the facility by tank truck, railcar, or in containers.  The finished product leaving the plant is non-hazardous. \n \n 1.4  RMP  Regulated Substances\n \n The RMP regulated substances in use at the Rohm and Haas Hayward Plant are acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate, which are on the RMP list of"
