This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nOne Earth Energy, LLC?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nOne Earth Energy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Gibson City, Ford County, Illinois.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn. The regulated substances under the RMP program anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline). One Earth Energy, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 2.6 miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be 0.9 miles; due to the amount of each substance stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of all 18,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 2.2 miles from the center of the ammonia tank. Rural residence homes, recreation, major commercial, office and industrial areas are located within this 2.2 mile radius.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario"

      "SummaryText": " of denaturant at the facility is 200,000 pounds and would create a toxic cloud. The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all denaturant stored on site. The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.8 miles from the center of the tank farm. Rural residence homes are located within this 0.8 mile radius.\n\nAlthough One Earth Energy, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has to be completed for this facility.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nOne Earth Energy, LLC has constructed a new ethanol facility and is subject to RMP upon delivery of substances on site.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe One Earth Energy, LLC ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan and an SPCC.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.
