      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIneos, Lima, Ohio\nEPA Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nIneos is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Ineos USA LLC Plant is located at 1900 Ft. Amanda Road, Lima OH 45804 and is owned by Ineos LLC.  Our facility is a major producer of industrial chemical products. The plant's primary product, acrylonitrile, is manufactured by combining ammonia, propylene and air.  Acrylonitrile is a key ingredient in synthetic fibers, plastics and nitrile rubber.  Lima Chemicals also produces Barex, an acrylo-based resin which is clear, shatter-resistant, nearly impervious to oxygen and excels as a packaging material for many household and industrial products. We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile], Hydrocyanic Acid, Propylene [1-Propene], Ammonia (anhydrous), Formaldehyde (solution) and Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous). Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile] is used as a raw material for the Barex process. Hydrocyanic Acid [HCN] is a co-product produced in the acrylonitrile process and is used as a raw material for making a variety of chemicals. Propylene [1-Propene] is used for as a raw material for the production on acrylonitrile. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a raw mate"

Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as an inhibitor for the purification and storage of hydrocyanic acid.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been performed for all listed flammable and toxic chemicals at the facility. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations. A technical team consisting of seven local area chemical manufacturers and the City of Lima selected the basis for the scenarios. The team findings were communicated in public meetings. Specific information on these releases is presented in detail in the plan.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Ineos, Lima plant. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Ineos plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created, as part of the plant prevention program. "

In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nThe Ineos plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety Information.\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition). The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems). In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThis plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, this plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists. The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management. Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Ineos plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) "

The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\nThe Ineos plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTRAINING\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ineos plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the du"
