The City's published Safety and Health Manual includes Section 301 Hazard Communication, and Section 310 Emergency Action, both of which are directly applicable to the Risk Management Program. The program comprises a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to help ensure ongoing safe practices, and an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  All employees are authorized to call 911 if they feel the situation justifies it.\r\n \r\nStationary source and the regulated substances handled:  The City of Tulsa owns and operates the A.B. Jewell Water Treatment Plant (WTP), where it stores liquid chlorine under pressure in two 25-ton above-ground storage tanks in bulk quantities not to exceed 40,000 pounds per tank for a total of 80,000 pounds.  Chlorine is the primary disinfectant used in the water treatment process.\r\n\r\nThe two 25-ton storage tanks are located inside the chemical feed building on the west side of the WTP property.  The tanks were designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels.  Chlorine is fed as a gas from one of the tanks to the chemical treatment stream using vacuum chlorinators that regulate the quantities called for by the plant operation protocols.  The room housing the storage tanks is equipped with an air collection system designed to feed a packed tower scrubber to minimize the impact of an accidental release. The scrubber system was designed in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code with a capacity sufficient to treat the entire contents of one 25-ton storage tank.  The storage tanks and appurtenant valves and piping are maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute standards. In December 2011 the Chlorine tanks pressure plates a"

After this replacement, tank integrity, thickness, hydrostatic testing, tank flange & pressure plate inspections were conducted and approved by a state and nationally accredited entity (Pressure Vessel Fabrication and Repair accredited).  At the same time, all four angle valves and the safety relief valve were replaced during the inspection.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention and chemical-specific prevention steps:  The A.B. Jewell WTP operation includes measures to ensure compliance with EPA's accidental release prevention rule and all applicable state and local regulations.  The chlorine bulk storage tanks, scrubber system, piping, and associated equipment are designed, manufactured, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable ASME, Chlorine Institute, and Uniform Fire Code Standards.  The City of Tulsa has completed a hazard review of the chlorine system and documented the findings.  Operations and maintenance procedures to ensure proper operation and equipment integrity have been developed and implemented, and are updated as needed.  All employees responsible for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system have been trained and participate in regularly scheduled refresher training. All plant management, operators, and maintenance staff have completed 40-hour HAZWOPER training and are current with their annual refresher training.  Training records are maintained.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  The A.B. Jewell WTP has had no accidental release during the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program: The City of Tulsa has prepared and implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for chlorine releases.  The purpose of the EAP is to protect employees and the public in the event of an accidental release of chlorine from the facility, and other events that may threaten safety and health, and to provide direction for notifications and evacuation if necessary. There is not a designated HAZMAT team of plant staff.  I"

New opportunities to promote safety will be evaluated and encouraged."
