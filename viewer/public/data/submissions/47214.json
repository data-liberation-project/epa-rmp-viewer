A main ingredient in our product is ammonia that is used in the final process of manufacturing diammonium phosphate fertilizers.  It is fertilizers such as this that in turn feed and clothe the rest of the world.\n\nAmong the many other things that Mississippi Phosphates brings to the community is a commitment to operate safely.  The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns.  A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel, and Mississippi Phosphates employees continuously look for innovative ways to operate and maintain the production facilities.  Mississippi Phosphates participates in routine safety training programs and drills.  In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensures that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nMississippi Phosphates has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together they are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies.  To ensure proper emergency preparedness, Mississippi Phosphates has a team of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialities.\n\nMPC transfers ammonia in a pipeline form to its atmospheric storage tank and to its fertilizer plant continuously.  A rupture of this pipeline would result in a release of 1,300 pounds of ammonia in an 8-minute period.  Under the regulatory defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.40-mile distance to the endpoint.  The distances to the endpoint for the alternate scenarios were also determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nMPC's safety and environmental record reflects this commitment.  We have multiple layers of safety and environmental protection in place at our plants to protect our employees and the community.  The following covers some of these layers of protec"

Formal audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nMPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nMPC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the EPA Risk Mnagement Program rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permits:\nMPC recognizes the inherent danger associated with hot work and requires the issuance of a work permit for all such activities at the facility. The permit documents that all appropriate fire prevention requirements have been considered and implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit is kept at the site of the work until completion of the hot work operation.\n\nContractors:\nMPC hires outside contractors to conduct some specialized maintenance and construction projects. All contractors working in the facility, or visitors to the facility, are expected to be aware of and adhere to all MPC health, safety, and environmental policies and procedures.  MPC will conduct or require proof of appropriate training.  MPC has a set policy for informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.

They involve what if scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\nEmergency response, including employee responders as well as off-site responders, add another layer of protection to the community.\n\nWe work closely with the police and fire departments, and we conduct routine drills.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond.\n\nMPC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following summarizes the elements to the release prevention program that are in place at our Pascagoula facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern.  MPC maintains a file and makes its employees aware of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nMPC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is known as the Hazard and Operability (HZAP) study.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years.

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMPC carries out documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment during each operational turnaround to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with training as needed.

The releases that MPC has had in the past 5 years are typically a small release to the air and do not meet the criteria that is set forth in the regulations.\n\nMPC has an extensive emergency response program.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.  The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance.  The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.\n\nThe plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nMPC is striving on a daily basis to make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  MPC literally has safety and/or environmental training going on almost daily.  Every employee and contractor will attend numerous safety and/or environmental training meetings annually.  MPC and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
