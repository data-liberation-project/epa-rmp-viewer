      "SummaryText": "Stampede Meat, Inc. (Stampede) operates a meat processing and storage facility in Bridgeview, Illinois.\r\n\r\nLike most large food processing plants, Stampede uses anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for use.  Because of the moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\n\r\nStampede is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for it's employees and surrounding community.  The refrigeration system complies with local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Stampede has developed a Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Program (RMP) to ensure safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nIt is Stampede's priority to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials rather than responding to emergencies.  The PSM/RM program includes the following elements:\r\n- Employee Participation: Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \r\n- Process Safety Information:  Stampede Meat, Inc. maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed on June 21, 2018. \r\n- Process Hazard Analysis:  Stampede Meat, Inc."

In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Stampede Meat, Inc. conducted a thorough, initial, PHA study for the refrigeration system during August 2003. PHA revalidation studies have been conducted during August 2008, June 2013, and June 2018.\r\n- Standard Operating Procedures:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Stampede Meat, Inc. updated standard operating procedures for the refrigeration system during July and August 2007.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  Stampede Meat, Inc. formalized maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system during July and August 2007.\r\n- Management of Change:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific management of change procedure that ensures changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented.\r\n- Training:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the caus"

Stampede Meat, Inc. updated their hot work permit procedures for the refrigeration system during June 2008. The hot work permit procedure was last reviewed on August 9, 2017.\r\n- Incident Investigation:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed.\r\n- Emergency Response: Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) and does not respond internally to major ammonia releases. \r\n- Compliance Audits:  Stampede Meat, Inc. has developed a site-specific compliance audit program that ensures compliance audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years to verify that Stampede Meat, Inc.

Three (3) year compliance audits were conducted on June 16, 2010, June 18, 2013, and June 7 and 8, 2016 and completed on August 9, 2017.\r\n- Trade Secrets:  A program has been developed for use in the event of trade secret information arising.\r\n- Management System:  An overall management system has been developed to monitor the ongoing progress of the PSM/RM program.\r\n\r\nPer EPA requirements, Stampede has analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this risk management plan.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents.\r\n\r\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of the high pressure receiver over a ten minute period.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, or a 200 parts per million (ppm) concentration 1.0 mile beyond the property line.\r\n\r\nThe \"alternative\" scenario involves a 0.5 inch hole in the outdoor piping. The alternative release scenario has an offsite impact of 0.2 miles.  Stampede estimates that the release would end after thirty-nine minutes, a plausible time period considering the ammonia detectors, alarms, and monitoring equipment installed at the facility.\r\n\r\nStampede used the EPAs RMP*Comp program to estimate hazards.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced accidental ammonia releases since construction was completed in 2003.\r\n\r\nThrough the PSM/RM program, Stampede systematically reviews potential changes to improve the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Stampede is currently working to resolve recommendations and findings raised in the latest PHA."
