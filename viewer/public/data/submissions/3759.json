In this capacity, the Hastings Terminal has served in support of Farmlands 600,000 member-owners for over 37 years.\n\nThe Hastings Terminal is a solid, reliable member of the Hastings community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to serve the member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Farmlands Hastings employees know that their customers are also their neighbors and strive \"to always be there if someone needs us\".\n\nThe Hastings Terminal has 21 full-time and 2 part-time employees, with a total of nearly 300 years of combined operating experience.  Although not large in number, these employees make a big impact on the community in which they live.  They can be found on the Hastings Chamber of Commerce, Agri-Business Subcommittee, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and are involved in area youth activities.  Farmlands employees recognize that community involvement and volunteerism are the most effective way to improve the communities they live in.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Hastings Terminal that is subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule.  The anhydrous ammonia is primarily received by rail and shipped by truck and is stored as a refrigerated liquid at ambient pressure in four 15,000 tons/each tanks and as a liquid under pressure in two 200 tons/each bullets.  A large refrigeration system is utilized in support of the storage of the liquid at ambient pressure and various vessels and piping serve in the transfer of ammonia within the process.  Two ammonia heaters are utilized to raise the temperature of the refrigerated liquid from   -28 degrees F to 35 degrees F , as required for the loading of ammonia transports.

Since 1985, the Hastings facility has functioned strictly as a terminal for anhydrous ammonia, utilizing the storage and transfer infrastructure of the original manufacturing plant.  Also, since 1985, changes including additions and improvements have resulted in the current design and operation of the terminal.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response \n\nIt is Farmlands corporate policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and, particularly, of any hazardous or regulated substance and to minimize and eliminate to the extent possible even minor and inconsequential releases of any type.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of the terminal, to the safety of its employees and to the safety of the general public.  Consequently, the management and employees of the Hastings Terminal are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.\n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the Hastings Terminal is committed to the following:\n\n7 a knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n7 a well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n7 implementation of a comprehensive Process Safety Management and Accidental Release Prevention Program\n7 continual review and improvement that enhances safety and accident prevention programs\n7 excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n7 planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\nThe Hastings Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan - as required by the RMProgram and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules - in effect for many ye"

The EPA does not allow active mitigation measures to be considered in the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The impact of the potential release must be quantified in accordance with the release criteria dictated in the rule.

Therefore, the hypothetical worst-case release scenario for this location is assumed to involve the catastrophic failure of one of these 15,000 ton tanks.  And, as required by the rule, the worst-case release scenario also assumes that the entire 15,000 ton storage tank content is released as a gas in 10 minutes.

Since the RMProgram rule does not require the use of a catastrophic vessel failure for the alternative release scenario and since the rule does allow for the consideration of active mitigation measures such as system shutdown safeguards (which are located throughout the terminal) and operator intervention to mitigate and limit the consequences of an accidental release, the release rates and total release amounts for alternative release scenarios are generally significantly lower than those of worst-case release scenarios.  Thus, the alternative release scenario could include such an event as an ammonia transfer line or hose failure, the lifting of a safety relief valve, a seal failure on an ammonia transfer pump or etc.\n\nThe hypothetical alternative release scenario for the Hastings Terminal is assumed to involve a break in a four inch ammonia transfer line with the passage of one minute before an operator activates the emergency stop system and with the passage of another two minutes before the release from the associated piping subsides.  The distance to the endpoint for this release was determined with the DEGADIS model, i.e. a publicly available model which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with ammonia release events.

      "SummaryText": "he impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend offsite.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the Hastings Terminal which is facilitated by the Process Safety Management/Prevention Program.   In a formal procedure, at least every five years, the process hazard analysis is updated and revalidated but review is also constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
