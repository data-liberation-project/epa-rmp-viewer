These actions will reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario.                    \n                                        \n1.4    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps                            \n                                \nThe storage tanks are equipped with passive mitigation devices.  Mass flow valves are designed to prevent the rapid loss of material through piping as the result of a sudden loss of pressure.  Transfer operations moving anhydrous ammonia from tanker trucks to storage tanks are monitored by trained personnel.                    \n                                \nEmployees have been trained as to the proper handling and hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Containers are properly labeled and hazard warnings posted.  Personal protective equipment appropriate for working with anhydrous ammonia has been provided to the employees.                    \n1.5    Five-Year Accident History                        \n    \nNone                \n\n1.6    Emergency Response Program                                                        \nIn the event of a reportable release of anhydrous ammonia, Buffalo Coal employees have been trained to take immediate actions to mitigate the release, don personal protective equipment, evacuate to a designated area, communicate with other off-site personnel and contact local authorities through the LEPC.                    \n                            \n1.7    Planned Changes to Improve Safety                            \nBased on the most recent hazard evaluation performed at the facility in June 1999, Buffalo Coal will improve the labeling and protective barriers around each tank and purchase new respirators for employee use."
