The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nEthosEnergy Group's cogeneration facility, Carson Energy Cogeneration Plant is located at 8580 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA in Sacramento County. The cogeneration facility uses anhydrous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to control nitrogen emissions from the cogeneraton gas turbines. \n\n\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located just south of the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The facility comprises a 100-megawatt cogeneration power plant fueled by a combination of purchased natural gas and digester gas from the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant. There are 10 full-time employees at this site.  Anhydrous ammonia is receiv"

Ammonia vapor is injected into each of the two gas turbine exhaust ducts where it dissociates into free nitrogen and hydrogen under high temperature conditions and then re-combines with nitrogen oxides and oxygen under the influence of a catalyst to produce nitrogen gas and water vapor. The feed rate of ammonia is adjusted automatically, based on continuous emission monitors in the exhaust gas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of EthosEnergy Group that the receipt, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Carson Energy Group has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by EthosEnergy Group are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nEthosEnergy Group has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its selective catalytic reduction process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Carson Energy Group's opera"

Carson Emergy Group has instituted a formalized Program and Document Management Policy and Procedure as the management system for the Process Safety and Risk Management Programs, including a tracking procedure to follow completion of committed actions.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, installation of an additional emergency shower and eyewash station, and the creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEthosEnergy Group's Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with Carson Energy Group personnel in response drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Carson Energy Group committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
