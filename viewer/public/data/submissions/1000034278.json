These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.

There is a 24 hour communications capability with DEP officials, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire departments, Sheriff's department, State Police, etc.).  In addition to established lines of communication with area emergency response organizations, the site is also a member of the St. Charles Parish Industrial Mutual Aid Association.  Periodic emergency drills are held with the LEPC, DEP, Mutual Aid Organization members, and local emergency response organizations.  Refresher information that is related to the RMP regulated substances is also made available to local emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nThe DEP is responsible for maintaining written plans for the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery of any natural or technological disaster that may occur in St. Charles Parish.  This responsibility includes coordination with neighboring parishes that may be affected by an emergency incident within St. Charles Parish.  The DEP is also responsible for coordinating the plans and operations of various emergency response agencies in St. Charles Parish such as fire, police, emergency medical services, public works, volunteers, and other groups that respond to emergencies.  \r\n\r\nThe written emergency response plan covers topics such as responding to a potential release, fire, explosion, or chemical release.

There are no toxic substances stored in quantities above the RMP thresholds listed in 40 CFR Part 68 , thus toxic WCS and ARS modeling is not required. The flammable WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions, nor allow credit for existing mitigation measures that have been identified.  Based on the review conducted when preparing this executive summary, the flammable ARS is considered a more realistic scenario and takes into account actual operating conditions.\r\n\r\nThe following are summaries of the flammable WCS and ARS modeling at NCP - West Site.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) RMP*Comp Version 1.07 off-site consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors, and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS LandView&reg; VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\r\n\r\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for the consideration of mitigation measures in WCS modeling, various prevention measures that are in place should reduce the likelihood of the WCS and its impacts should it occ"

These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n-  Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs;\r\n-  Routine surveillance by trained operators;\r\n-  Various audible and visual alarm and notification systems;\r\n-  Responder call-out, incident command establishment and staging, and agency notification, as necessary.\r\n\r\n1. Flammable Worst-Case Release Scenario - Butylene\r\n\r\nThe WCS for a flammable release assumes the catastrophic failure, instantaneous release, and vapor cloud explosion of 11,692,800 lbs of butylene.  The butylene is actually held in two storage vessels that are in close enough proximity to be considered co-located.  The WCS assumes that if one of the storage vessels catastrophically fails then it is likely that the structural integrity of the other sphere will also be compromised.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to structural and natural obstacles between the sphere and off-site receptors.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 1.8 miles (2.9 kilometers).  A population estimate of 3,588 people off-site, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  Bayou Trepagnier, a designated scenic stream adjacent to the northern side of the facility, may also be impacted.\r\n\r\n2. Flammable Alternative Release Scenario - Butylene\r\n\r\nThe ARS for this facility assumes a one-half inch leak in an elbow in the 14 inch line to the feed pumps between one of the two butylene storage spheres and the first isolation valve.  A release of butylene and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion occurs as a result of this equipment malfunction.  Although the mixture is liquefied under pressure in this line, modeling was conducted based on a gas release because it produced a longer distance to endpoint and was a more conservative"
