Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Little Cedar Co-op Elevator in Little Cedar are strongly committed to employee, public, and\r\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\r\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\r\nresponse efforts with the Stacyville Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\r\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our facility in Little Cedar (Figure 1).  The maximum\r\namount stored is 25,500 gallons (131,223 pounds) at the standard maximum fill capacity of 85%. \r\nWith the inclusion of our facility nurse tanks, we have a total storage capacity of 245,140 pounds\r\nof anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nWe utilized RMP Comp for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\r\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of one of the \r\nlargest single anhydrous ammonia storage tanks (131,223 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute\r\nperiod.  We anticipated that administrative controls or mitigation would not effect the release rate. \r\nAt Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind spee"

Radius2 x 3.14 = area of\r\ncircle. 2.0 miles2 x 3.14 x 75 people = approximately 950  people within 2.0 mile radius of the site. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from vehicular collision with the tank resulting\r\nin a pipe break and the release of anhydrous ammonia through a 1 to 3\" dia. hole in the anhydrous\r\nammonia product line.  Vehicular collision (RMP Hazard Review, Section 8.4) was selected as the\r\nmost probable causal agent for an alternative release scenario.  The scenario involves the release of \r\n2,500 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of two minutes.  Active mitigation\r\n(emergency shutoff) limited the release to two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the\r\nmaximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.4 mile (Figure 3).

The following sections briefly describe the elements\r\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nLittle Cedar Co-op Elevator maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the\r\nchemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\r\n(Appendix D).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\r\nidentified and controlled effectively."

These procedures address various modes of operation;\r\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\r\n(Appendix B).\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nLittle Cedar Co-op Elevator has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees\r\nwho are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nLittle Cedar Co-op Elevator conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\r\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\r\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\r\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\r\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
