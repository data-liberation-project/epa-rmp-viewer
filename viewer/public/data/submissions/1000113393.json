As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are non-responding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency\nresponse organizations that hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities. Rinchem has, and will continue to send community outreach letters to emergency response organizations (LEPC, Fire and Police) and invite these organizations to tour our stationary sources and participate in accidental release drills.\n1.6 Planned changes to improve safety:\nThe facility evaluates, resolves, and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews, audits, process hazard analyses, and incident\ninvestigations. Changes may be made to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.
