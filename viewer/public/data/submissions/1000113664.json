It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our personnel are trained to mitigate or control the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Local HazMat Region 13 in Salem Oregon and Marion County Fire District#1 who provides additional emergency response expertise for our facility.\n\n2.\tThe stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility, which is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 48,600 in all PSM regulated systems in our facility.\n\n\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nNORPAC Foods Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility has implemented and now conduc"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are re-validated at a regular interval of every three years. New management team is fully committed and any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, NORPAC Foods Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and start up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the process. \n\nTraining:\nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program in place to ensure employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Operators are encouraged to take the RETA (Refrigeration Engineers Technicians Association) CARO Certified Assistant Refrigeration Operator exam for new employees with one year of experience and the CIRO Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator exam with three years of experience on the job. NORPAC's goal is to eventually request all operators to get these certifications as job requirement in order to operate our systems. Also, refresher training will be provided at least annually and more frequently as needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity: \nNORPAC Foods Inc. has implemented and carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner as new expectation and fully supported by management. \n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at NORPAC Foods Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology equipment, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job task are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-Startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at NORPAC Foods Inc. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe start up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nNORPC Foods Inc. has implemented and now conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nNORPAC Foods Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release form reoccurring and reviewed by management.
