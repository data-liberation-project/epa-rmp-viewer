The maximum expected inventory of oleum based upon our operational requirements is 1,100,000 pounds. It is used to create products used by most Americans on a regular basis. Oleum is a constituent of laundry detergent and is also used to produce white oil and computer chips. \r\n\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions provides recycling of chemical spent sulfuric acid services. Methyl ether and chloromethane are the regulated substances that are present in the chemical spent regeneration process from unloading rail cars and truck trailers into separate tanks to the pumping of chemical spent to the decomposition furnace where it is incinerated. Inventory estimates were updated based on current operations in preparation of the 2022 RMP Update and indicated that there is the potential for chloromethane to be onsite in quantities above the threshold quantity; therefore, both methyl ether and chloromethane are being included in this submittal. The maximum expected inventory of methyl ether and chloromethane are 63,000 pounds and 31,000 pounds, respectively.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Prevention Program Steps\r\n\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions is committed to reducing the risk of accidental release of hazardous substances at our Oregon facility. First, this facility has been constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. Second, because the oleum process is subject to the EPA's Risk Management Plan, we also take all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements for Program 3 processes that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the accident prevention programs in place at the oleum process at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nChemtrade Refinery Solutions maintains detailed records of Process Safety Information to ensure the safe operation of its facility.
