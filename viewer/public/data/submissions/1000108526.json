The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuating employees if necessary and for coordinating with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed. These corrective items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\nAll refrigeration equipment is new and the installing refrigerating contractor performed pressure tests and pre-startup safety checks before the startup of the system. The refrigeration system is operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Preventative maintenance is preformed by a licensed refrigeration contractor."

They are also trained in emergency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, and contractors are trained in emergency shutdown and system pumpdown procedures. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. The ammonia detection system shuts down the refrigeration system if the ammonia concentration in the engine room reaches 10,000 ppm. Personnel will automatically be notified if any ammonia detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. Automatic crossover valve relieves high pressure from the high side to the low side at predetermined set pressures. All of the relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\nAccording to Mann Packing Gonzales personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nMann Packing Gonzales Facility is a Non-Responding facility. Facility personnel only respond to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. \nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible for coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency res"

Evaporator valve stations are on the roof of the cold rooms.\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. The refrigeration control system sends alarms to the refrigeration manager in the case of emergency situations or any high pressure, high temperature, or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves.\nThere are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical room for alarming. The ammonia detection system sends notifications to the facility guard shack (monitored 24/7) and the refrigeration manager. Facility employees are trained in emergency notification procedures as detailed in the Emergency Action Plan. \nThe refrigeration system at the facility was constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total ammonia charge of the refrigeration systems at the facility is approximately 25,663 lb.\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is single-stage vapor compression cycles.\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nMann Packing Gonzales maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.\nThe ammoni"

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nMann Packing Gonzales conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. \nMann Packing Gonzales is a Non-Responding facility and does not respond to ammonia releases including emergency shutdown, equipment isolation, and pumping down the system. The facility has prepared an emergency action plan and, in addition, will coordinate with local emergency responding agencies, specifically, the local fire department. Emergency action plan activities will be limited to hazard identification; notification of employees, local fire department, and surrounding businesses; evacuation of employees; and assistance to the fire department emergency response team if requested.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nMann Packing Gonzales uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their operations. \nThe ammonia system is used for cold storage, chilled water generation for produce processing, and air compressor refrigerated cooler. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of screw and reciprocating type compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators (fan coils), plate frame type water chillers, falling film chillers submerged tank plate heat exchanger, ammonia detection, control systems and diffusion tank. \nThe facility remains operational throughout the year. The mechanical room houses one low pressure recirculator package, five ammonia pumps, three reciprocating compressors, and two screw compressors. The equipment yard contains two evaporative condensers, one high pressure receiver, one plate frame heat exchanger, and one diffusion tank. All the evaporators and falling film chillers are l"
