This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Jupiter Sulphur, LLC (Jupiter Sulphur) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\n    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\n    SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Facility is located in Kay County approximately one-fourth mile south of the intersection of Highway 60 and Highway 177 in Ponca City, Oklahoma. The Facility produces and distributes chemicals used in the agriculture and chemical market.  \n\n\n\nProduction at the Facility consists of the manufacturing of ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), ammonium sulfide (ASD), ammonium bisulfite (ABS), Ammonium Polysulfide (APS) and molten sulfur.  The products and raw materials require loading/unloading operations at the Facility, as well as the associated process and storage equipment and piping.\n\n\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Jupiter Sulphur identified no listed flammable substances and one listed toxic regulated substance kept on site above threshold quantities (anhydrous ammonia).\n\n\n\n The Ponca City Facility has Program 3 processes under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n\n\nGroup VP - Accountable for all RMP and PSM compliance of all company facilities.\n\n\n\nPSM Coordinator - Chair the steering committee.

The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP), regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The facility is in the continuous process of reviewing the accident prevention program and as such is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nThe Ponca City Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and the conducting of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  \n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

      "SummaryText": "y\n\n\n\nThe Ponca City Facility has had no RMP incidents with anhydrous ammonia within the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\n\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures account for the possibility of a toxic substance being accidentally released, as well as for the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Facility. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Facility is coordinated with the County LEPC.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire and police department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."
