Telephone (785) 392-2121\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ada Grain and Boettcher Enterprises, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  To accomplish these objectives, the Risk Management Plan incorporates programs for hazard review, hazard assessment, information on the facility and equipment, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audit for compliance, and investigation of incidents involving any damage or injuries on or off-site.  Individual programs are reviewed and revised as needed and depending on the conclusions of any incident investigation.  Should the facility undergo significant change in products or services or physical plant, programs are reviewed as to their content for the changes at the facility.  \n\n2.  Facility Information - Ada Grain, 106 Main Street, Ada, Kansas  67414 (785) 392-2300.  The two 11,000 gallon ammonia storage tanks are located 1/2 mile West of Ada on the South side of a County Blacktop road.  Ammonia nurse trailers are also parked at this location.  \n\n The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n The maximum quantity stored would be 170,000 pounds, composed of 110,000 pounds  in our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks, plus a total  potential of 66,000 pounds in 6,  1000 gallon nurse trailers"

The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented most of the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29  CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The governing regulations are put forth by the Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) and the facility is inspected on a regular basis by company personnel, inspectors from the Kansas Department of Agriculture, and representatives of the Company's insurance carrier.  Important differences between ANSI standards and KDA regulations involve color coding of valves, installation of a bulkhead at the truck unloading point, and remote shut-offs for the storage tank(s).  The Company has adopted a plan to bring all facilities and equipment into compliance with ANSI standards by the end of 2005.\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor  to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Security\n\nA security assessment and Security Plan has been developed for the location which identifies risks to \nsite security and personnel.  In accordance with the security assessment, the Security Plan includes \npolicies and actions to be taken.  These elements are included in the Risk Management Plan for the \nfacility.\n \n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n The facility has:\n\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CF"

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  At least annually,  evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional, specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.  Training is on-going and accomplished through a combination of in-company meetings, seminars, use of videos, and site-specific analysis."
