It is assumed that the entire contents of the ammonia refrigeration system are released. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint for this worst-case release is 2.6 miles.\n\nThere are offsite consequences indicated which affect schools, residences, jails, recreation areas, office/commercial/industrial areas, shopping centers, the New York Thruway,  parks and a wildlife management area.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe alternative scenario is one of from the 5-year release history of a sister facility. Equipment failure causes liquid ammonia to be contained in a section of pipe, which then warms and  causes an overpressure situation.  The anhydrous ammonia then is released through the pressure relief valve through the vent  stack.  2,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are released in 10 minutes.  Unconfined vapor travels 0.1miles using typical Buffalo, NY,  meteorology of 3 meters/second wind speed and D stability class.\n\nThere are offsite consequences predicted  affecting residences and commercial/industrial areas.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTOPS Market, Inc. has in place a prevention program encompassing elements consistent Occupational Safety and Health Administratio"
