In order to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and protect public safety and environment, BEI Hawaii developed site specific Risk Management Plan (RMP) for BEI Hawaii?s warehouses that are regulated under risk management program. \n\nThe Goal of a Risk Management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to the public and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is prepared for BEI Hawaii - Maui facility, formerly know as Brewer Environmental Industries, to address one of the six warehouses statewide which store fertilizer, pesticides, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.  BEI Hawaii developed this site specific Risk Management Plans for BEI Hawaii?s facility that are regulated under risk management program to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and to protect public safety and environment.  The goal of our risk management program is to prevent serious chemical accidents that could cause harm to our employees, the publics, and the environment and to reduce the potential impact of the accidental release.  Our Maui facility is located at 91-291 Kaomi Loop, Kapolei, on the island of Oahu.\n\nThis RMP consists of four chapters.  Chapter 1, Management, introduces the plans and describes the facility operations, management and responsibilities.  Chapter 2, Hazardous Assessment, provides an overview of the chemicals stored in our Barbers Point facility, their hazard release consequences and impact in worst case and alternative scenario, and five-year accident history.

Chapter 4, Summary of Emergency Response program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBEI Hawaii believes in a clean and safe environment and is dedicated to meeting all applicable environmental standards in the operation of its businesses and services.  BEI Hawaii has established comprehensive policies and procedures for the operations of its facilities.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance that assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to Chief Executive Officer of the company, or designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy working environment, and to protect the environmental from pollutions.\n\nPreservation of the environment is a commitment that must be shared by all employees.  Employees shall promptly report suspected violations of environmental laws, regulations or permits to their supervisor who shall take immediate action to verify the report and, If confirmed, stop the violation and take remedial or other appropriate action.   The incident shall be promptly reported to BEI Hawaii?s Regulatory Compliance manager, who will assist in making any necessary reports to regulatory agencies.\n\nOverall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone?s responsibility and working safely is a condition of employment. Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures. Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions, training and a safety award program.   \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \nThe BEI HAWAII ? Maui facility is located at 275East Waiko Road, Maui, Hawaii.  The fa"

      "SummaryText": "cility stores pesticides, fertilizers and industrial chemicals.  The products are warehoused at the facility and distributed to various locations throughout the Maui Island.  The regulated substance handled at this storage/distribution facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is received in 150-lb and 1-ton Department of Transportation (DOT) approved cylinders.  BEI HAWAII receives chlorine from a chemical supplier and distributor located on the west coast.  The chlorine supplier is responsible for container inspection and maintenance.  On average, the BEI HAWAII facility stores approximately 60,000 lbs chlorine (this value can increase to about 116,000 lbs chlorine depending on shipping schedules).  Because bulk sales are made directly to customers, access to the facility is not restricted.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nTwo release scenarios (worst case scenario and alternative scenario) have been assessed for chlorine.\n    a) Worst Case scenario\nThe release scenario is the total release of the largest quantity of the regulated chemical from a one-ton cylinder.  There is no passive mitigation and the release occurs under the worst weather conditions.\n\n    b) Alternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario is most likely to occur than the worst case, and there is an active mitigation measure that can limit the amount of release.  \n\nIn both cases the OCA Guidance was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\nThe facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  A process safety management plan was written for the facility that includes all of the required elements.  Since the process is storage only, the practices important to the prevention program are the proper storage and handling of the chlorine.  Dry, isolated and fireproof storage spaces are provided where the temperature of the vicinity of the cylinders never reaches 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Proper loading and unloading of cylinders from trucks"

      "SummaryText": " are very important to prevent cylinders from falling and cause possible damage to the valve area.  Training and careful work practices are the key to preventing accidental damage to the cylinders.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility has not experienced any accidents during the past five years.  This is understandable because the process is mainly storage only with minimal using of the chlorine on site.\n\nEmergency Response Program \nThe BEI HAWAII ? Maui facility is classified as a non-responding facility.  As such, BEI HAWAII has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee/community safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response with an in-house response team.  The BEI HAWAII - Maui Facility has developed its own procedures as outlined in the BEI HAWAII Safety and Health Program incorporating information from Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  BEI HAWAII has coordinated response to incidents with the Maui Fire Department Hazmat Team.  Operators are capable, however, of responding to incidental releases such as routine tightening of a valve, for example. \n\nBEI HAWAII ? Maui facility personnel will only perform defensive mitigation measures (i.e., secure areas, initiate water spray, etc.,) to limit the release until a response team arrives to establish the incident command.  We have discussed this program with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Maui Fire Department.  In addition, BEI HAWAII has arranged with local response contractors to deal with potential releases at the facility.  \n\n\nPlanned change to improve safety\nThere are no current plans to change storage practices at this facility. Chlorine use for swimming pools and sewage treatment is anticipated to diminish over the next few years as new disinfections methods are employed.  BEI HAWAII has already experienced reduced levels of chlorine at its facilities as a result of its efforts to educate and switch customers from chlorine g"
