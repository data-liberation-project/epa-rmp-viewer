This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  The objective of risk management and our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, CRRM's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCRRM's Coffeyville Refinery (Refinery), located near Coffeyville, KS, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, diesel fuels and coke) from crude oil.  Several regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures and one toxic substance, hydrofluoric acid, are contained in processes above threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nProcesses included in the plan are subject to the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP).  Some processes at the Refinery are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Refinery. This section addresses the following elements:   Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit and Contractors.  The accident prevention program at the Refinery equally covers all individually listed regulated substances, flammable mixtures, and toxic substance.  \n\n\n\nProces"

      "SummaryText": "s Safety Information\n\n\n\nCRRM maintains a variety of technical documents and standard operating procedures that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  This information addresses any known hazards associated with the use and handling of chemicals.  Safe operating limits and consequences of deviation have been established for processes.  The Refinery ensures that processes are maintained within these safe operating limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\n\n\n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  These documents include materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identi"

The refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique to perform Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process evaluated.  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with the design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  Hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1) initial startup;\n\n(2) normal operations;\n\n(3) temporary operations;\n\n(4) emergency shutdown;\n\n(5) emergency operations;\n\n(6) normal shutdown; and,\n\n(7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  \n\n\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.
