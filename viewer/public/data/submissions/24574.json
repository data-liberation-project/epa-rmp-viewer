(TCCS)\n\nNorfolk, Nebraska\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\n\n\n\nENSR Consulting - Engineering - Remediation\n\n\n\nNovember 2001\n\nDocument Number  3661-045-100\n EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the policy of the IBP, inc. (IBP) Norfolk, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to IBP employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all IBP owned activities at this facility.\nIBP's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nIBP operates a cold storage warehouse at this location.  In the past, the facility operated a slaughter/processing area for beef fabrication.  Proposed future operations will include beef fabrication.  Support operations include truck docks for shipping and receiving and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or"

The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B ?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Norfolk, Nebraska facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\nThe Norfolk, Nebraska facility has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems: the Slaughter and Freezer refrigeration systems.  The larger ammonia system is in the Slaughter refrigeration system.  The worst-case release area for the Slaughter ammonia system would contain the area impacted by the worst-case release for the Freezer ammonia systems.  Therefore, one worst-case toxic release was specified for the entire facility.\nAmmonia\nThe data provided in the document \"Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and woul"

The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the Recirculator #1 in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 27,681 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 2,768.1 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the Recirculator #1is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.89 miles (3.04 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario.  The largest relief valve has a relief rate of 75.6 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 75.6 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 54.2 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of IBP's operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the rele"

Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 201 ppm is reached at 0.067 miles (107 meters) from the release point.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Norfolk, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n? 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n? 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n? 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key concepts in IBP's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  IBP has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by IBP management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.\nIBP policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  IBP maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nIBP is committed to providing appropriate training to al"

In addition, IBP conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\nFive Year Accident History\nIBP has owned and operated this facility since 1998.  IBP has not had a release of ammonia from the Norfolk, Nebraska facility that has affected the public or the environment.  Prior to IBP ownership, IBP is not aware of a release of ammonia that has affected the public or the environment.\nEmergency Response Program\nIBP does not have emergency response capability on site to respond to an emergency. It is IBP's policy to contact off-site emergency responders for assistance in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.\nIBP has met with the local fire department to review the ammonia system and to establish coordination and communication procedures.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIBP completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems each time a design change is implemented.  IBP is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems.\n \nCERTIFICATION\nThe undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nName:    Ray McGaugh\nTitle:    Plant Manager\nSignature:    \nDate:    \n\n\nName:    Eric Carlson\nTitle:    Freezer Manager\nSignature:    \nDate:    \n\n\n  TABLE OF CONTENTS\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY    i\nCERTIFICATION    iv\n1.

This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\nThe alternative release scenario for each covered process must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B ?68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\nDue to the presence of trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Norfolk, Nebraska facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\nThe Norfolk, Nebraska facility has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems: the Slaughter and Freezer refrigeration systems.  The larger ammonia system is in the Slaughter refrigeration system.  The worst-case release area for the Slaughter ammonia system would contain the area impacted by the worst-case release for the Freezer ammonia systems.  Therefore, one worst-case toxic release was specified for the entire facility.\n2.1. Ammonia System\n2.1.1.

      "SummaryText": "ternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).  The ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions.\nThe worst-case release scenario for an anhydrous ammonia release included a release of all the contents of the Recirculator #1 in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines).  This release translates to a release of 27,681 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 2,768.1 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the Recirculator #1 is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec, and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The following table from the ammonia refrigeration document was used to determine the endpoint distance for the worst-case release scenario.\n\nPredicted Distance to Toxic Endpoints - Worst-Case Release Scenario\nTotal Mass    Predicted Distance to Toxic Endpoint (ft)\nReleased (lbs)    Rural    Urban\n1,000    3,100    2,100\n1,500    3,700    2,500\n2,000    4,300    2,900\n3,000    5,200    3,500\n4,000    6,000    4,000\n5,000    6,600    4,500\n6,000    7,300    4,900\n7,000    7,800    5,200\n8,000    8,400    5,600\n9,000    8,900    5,900\n10,000    9,500    6,200\n15,000    11,500    7,500\n20,000    13,300    8,600\n25,000    15,000    9,500\n30,000    16,400    10,400\n35,000    17,800    11,200\n40,000    19,100    11,900\n45,000    20,300    12,600\n50,000    21,400    13,200\n60,000    23,600    14,400\n70,000    25,600    15,500\n80,000    27,400    16,600\n90,000    29,100    17,500\n\nTherefore, to determine the toxic endpoint distance for the IBP Norfolk, Nebraska, facility, the data must be"

Alternative Release Scenario\nThe selected alternative release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The largest relief valve in the system was used in this scenario. The largest relief valve has a release rate of 75.6 pounds of air per minute.\nAs a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  In order to calculate the ammonia relief rate for this relief valve, the ammonia saturation temperature at the relief pressure (250 psig) must be calculated.\nTo calculate the saturation temperature of ammonia at 264.7 psia (absolute) or 250 psig (gauge), the thermodynamic properties for ammonia, taken from the IIAR Ammonia Data Book Appendix A, were interpolated.\n\nSaturation Temperature    Saturation Pressure\nT1 = 114    P1 = 261.66\nT2 = 115    P2 = 265.57\n\nInterpolation Equation:\n\n     \n\n    Ts = Saturation Temperature @ 264.7 psia or 250 psig\n    Ps = Saturation Pressure (264.7 psia)\n\nTherefore:\n     \n\n    Ts = 114.8 ?F\n\nTo calculate the relationship of the release of air to ammonia, the following calcula"

It has been determined, through a review of IBP's operational history, that the total release would likely be 500 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 54.2 lbs/min, the duration for a 500-pound release is 9.2 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.  Therefore, to determine the toxic endpoint distance for alternative release, the release rate must be interpolated from the following table.  This release rate was applied to a release from the ammonia header on top of the building.\n\nAlternative Release in Typical Weather Conditions\nRelease Rate    Predicted Distance to Toxic Endpoint (ft)\n(lbs/minute)    Rural    Urban\n0.1    70    50\n0.2    90    60\n0.3    100    65\n0.5    120    70\n0.7    130    80\n1.0    150    85\n2.0    190    100\n3.0    220    120\n5.0    270    140\n7.0    310    160\n10.0    360    180\n20.0    490    230\n30.0    580    270\n50.0    740    340\n70.0    850    400\n100.0    1,020    450\n150.0    1,260    540\n200.0    1,970    940\n300.0    2,450    1,160\n500.0    3,240    1,510\n\nInterpolation Equation:\n\n \n\n    R Ammonia = Alternative Release Rate (lbs/minutes)\n    R1 = Less Than Alternative Release Rate (lbs/minutes)\n    R2 = More Than Alternative Release Rate (lbs/minutes)\n    D Ammonia = Distance to Toxic Endpoint (miles)\n    D1 = Distance to Toxic Endpoint (feet) at R1 Release Rate\n    D2 = Distance to Toxic Endpoint (feet) at R2 Release Rate\n\nTherefore:\n\n \n"
