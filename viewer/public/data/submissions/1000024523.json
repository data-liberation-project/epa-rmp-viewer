      "SummaryText": "1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Cal West Cooling (CWC) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply to not have accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  The Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is executed through Western Precooling Systems (WPS); which owns the CWC facility.  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Cal West Cooling to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.    \n\n\n\nCWC recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The Company has adopted a \"Non-responding facility\" policy and has established an Emergency Action Plan within its California Hazardous Material Business Plan. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (City of Oxnard Fire/CUPA).  The local CUPA has verified the facility is included in the Community Area Plan, and inspects the facility on a regular basis.    WPS has offices and staff on-site.  WPS employs ammonia technicians trained beyond 1910.120(q) Awareness level.  These technicians would be notified to provide technical support in the event of an emergency.   The company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nCal West Cooling (CWC) is a facility located in Oxnard, CA in a comm"

The facility was built in the early 1970's on what were at that time the outskirts of the city, according to locally adopted codes in effect at that time.  Improvements over the years have been made according to codes in effect at the time.  Cal West Cooling is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems but operations are separated: \n\n\n\n - Cal West Cooling manages pre-cooling and refrigerated storage.\n\n - Western Precooling Systems maintains the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested fruit and vegetables.   The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July.  The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative.  Annual maintenance is performed on the equipment during August and September.\n\n\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  Refrigerating equipment consists of Compressor Units, Evaporative Condenser, Pressure Vessels, Cold Storage Room Evaporators, HydroVac Vacuum Tubes, Pressure Coolers, and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  Though rare, the facility has the ability to augment its existing equipment with portable refrigeration equipment according to seasonal harvest demand.   Some of the facility equipment is portable and may be used in other areas depending on geographical & seasonal harvest demand.  \n\n   \n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nWestern Pre"

      "SummaryText": "cooling Systems (WPS) is the company that operates and maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to dis-assembly and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the Service Call system. Tasks are tracked through the Service Call system.   Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Cal West Cooling and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).\n\n\n\nAs above, a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site, in accordance with CCR 8, 5189. The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes. PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation. The written PSM document is maintained online by CWC.   \n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  WPS has installed these types of valves at the oil drain points.\n\n\n\nModification"

WPS has also reduced on and offsite consequence potential by piping pressure relief valves to an Ammonia-Water Diffusion System.  Relief valve excursions were identified as another common unwanted release situation and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of an over-pressure and relief situation should no longer affect people on or off-site.  \n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at CWC:\n\n\n\n - CWC has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the  facility from potential \"wrong-do-er's\".\n\n - Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc.  \n\n - Training is documented in each employees training record file.\n\n - A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department.  There have been demonstrations and tours of the system with the first responding engine companies to familiarize the crews with the facility layout and where hazardous areas are located.\n\n - The engine room is computer controlled with telephone access for monitoring and parameter changes.  The equipment may be shutdown from off site via phone if it were not possible to directly access the control area.\n\n - There is an automatic dialing machine that is connected to the computer control.  When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shutdown setting, or if there is a power failure, this auto dialer begins generating text messages to successive phone numbers to summon technicians to solve the problem.\n\n - The Ammonia Sensor and alarm system is \"third party monitored\" by an alarm co.  The alarm company makes notifications based upon pre-determined parameters.\n\n - Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\n\n1.4 "

There is no data to report.\n\n\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to notify and evacuate.  Only the Oxnard Fire Department would respond to an emergency.  WPS personnel trained beyond 29 CFR 1910.120(q) Awareness standards would be available as technical support.  WPS Refrigeration Technicians are provided with and maintain PPE according to their qualifications.  Written ammonia emergency procedures are detailed in the facility's \"Thirty Minute Plan\".  The \"California Hazardous Material Business Plan/Consolidated Contingency Plan\" was written to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements.  Each of these Plans are maintained and updated on a regular basis.\n\n  \n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n\n - Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n\n - Compliance Audits;\n\n - Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n\n - IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections;\n\n - WPS Inspection Protocol\n\n\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.
