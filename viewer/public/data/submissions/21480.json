The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\\par \r\n\\par The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Oleum Storage Tank T-8404.  The scenario involves the release of 46,155\\~lb. of Oleum (65%\r\n solution).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place, with a temperature of 102 degrees F and average ambient relative humidity of 72%.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 2379.14 minutes.  P\r\nassive mitigation controls such as a dike are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.55 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.01000 mg/L.\r\n\r\n\\par \r\n\\par One alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \r\n\\par \r\n\\par The alternative release scenario for Oleum (65%) involves a release from a ruptured transfer hose between the Oleum Stor\r\nage Tank T-8404 and the delivery Tanker Truck with a release of 500 lb. of Oleum.
