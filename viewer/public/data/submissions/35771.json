A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site.  Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediate dismissal from the site.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past 5 years, there was one accidental release of Ethylenediamine that resulted in an OSHA Recordable injury.  A PQ employee was splashed with a small amount of Ethylenediamine while attempting to pump Ethylenediamine from the storage tank to a process vessel.  Extreme cold weather caused a small section of the Ethylenediamine line to freeze.  The corrective actions included installing additional heat tracing for the Ethylenediamine line, as well as modifications to the system valves to allow for remote operation, rather than manual operation.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe PQ Kansas City Plant has an emergency response program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The program includes a written Emergency Response Plan and employee training in emergency response procedures. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for emerge"
