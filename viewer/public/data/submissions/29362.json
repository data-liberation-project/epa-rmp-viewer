This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: italic\n\u00b7\tIntroduction;\n\u00b7\tDawn Foods policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\n\u00b7\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7\tEmergency Communications;\n\u00b7\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures\n\u00b7\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tDawn Food\u00bfs Policies To Protect Health, Environment and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Dawn Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Dawn Foods is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Dawn Food\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the"

Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125 Exemptions \u00bf Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\n\nIII.\tFacility Identification\nThe Dawn Foods facility is located at 1300 East Summit Street in Crown Point, Indiana. The facility is a manufacturer of baked goods including baked muffins, raw frozen cookies, puff pastry and Danish doughs, fruit sticks, cinnamon rolls and frozen batters. The facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one refrigeration system onsite. The system originally contained a charge of 9,600 pounds of ammonia. It was recently modified via the addition of a compressor, four new evaporators and a floor warming system. The amount of ammonia present in the modified refrigeration system is approximately 13,500 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The ammonia receiver tank is identified as Vessel +25 and is located inside the main building in the engine room.  The receiver tank is not located near any other processes.  \n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u00bf Worse Case Scenarios (WCS)\nWhile a catastrophic release is not expected to occur, as required by the Rule, Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios were evaluated to estimate the potential offsite consequences (i.e., offsite consequence analysis (OCA)) to the public or the environment from the potential accidental release of ammonia. \n\nPursuant to the Rule, \u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\u00bf was used."

      "SummaryText": "The worst-case toxic accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of the primary ammonia receiver (approximately 30 psig), Vessel +25, which is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 10,800 pounds (80 percent vessel capacity). However, this vessel is designed to hold almost the entire ammonia system charge in the event that emergency shutdown of the system is required (its actual capacity is 13,452 pounds).  Therefore, the worse case scenario is based on a release from Vessel +25 containing 13,400 pounds of ammonia (using EPA's rounding guidance to two significant figures per the RMP Submit User's Manual dated January 4, 1999).\n\nEPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (EPA 550-B-00-006, May 2000) Exhibit 4-4, shows that under a worst-case release scenario \u00bf whereby the entire 13,400 pound quantity of anhydrous ammonia is released in a 10-minute period, the toxic endpoint distance is 1.0 mile (note that if 13,500 pounds is used as a worst-case quantity, the toxic endpoint distance is still 1.0 mile). The ERPG-2 airborne toxic endpoint concentration of 200 parts per million (ppm) or 0.14 mg/L is the maximum which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual\u00bfs ability to take protective action. Based upon year 2000 census data, the population within a radius of 1.0 mile is 2,937.\n\nIt should be noted that the worst-case scenario is an extremely unlikely event especially since most of the time, the ammonia is distributed within the piping of many refrigeration subsystems within the facility building \u00bf and is not contained within this large vessel.  During normal operation, Vessel +25 is administratively controlled to hold a maximum of 10,800 pounds (80 percent vessel capacity). However, in actuality, this vessel only holds five percent of the ammonia system charge during nor"

It is extremely unlikely that the majority of the system charge would need to be held in Vessel +25 and even more unlikely that a release would then occur from this vessel.\n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u00bf Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nAn ARS was modeled for ammonia in the hazard assessment and assumes that a leak occurs in a pipe joint, seal, valve or weld. \u00bfGuidance average\u00bf weather conditions including 3 meters per second wind speed and a D stability class at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C were used. The simplified Bernoulli equation was employed in the ARS OCA. Using a conservative pressure of 130 pounds per square inch (gauge) with a hole-diameter of up to 0.37 inches, the continuous release rate would be 250 pounds per minute, which would result in a 200-ppm toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles (Guidance Tables: Exhibits 4-5 and 4-6) in this urban setting. No mitigation measures were considered.\n\nA small population group may be affected by the ARS due to the close proximity of commercial business to the facility; however, the LandView Census estimator did not indicate any offsite receptors.\n\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur in August of 2006 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

Response activities will be coordinated with the Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) also known as the Lake County Hazardous Material Planning Committee, the Crown Point Fire Department and the Lake County Fire Chiefs Association HAZMAT Team. This coordination effort includes providing the fire departments with site diagrams and hazardous material information, meeting with fire department personnel to discuss facility operations/processes, and periodic on-site inspections by fire department personnel.\n\nThe facility maintains an ERP on file at the plant. According to the ERP, facility employees are responsible for responding to accidental releases of ammonia up to 300 ppm. The plan includes annual training of all employees on evacuation procedures and emergency notification procedures. The plan also includes annual training for emergency response team members. It identifies the Emergency Response Coordinators, Evacuation Coordinators and alternates. In addition to the facility ERP, the plant will be included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee. Dawn Foods also coordinates with the Crown Point Fire Department and the Lake County Fire Chiefs Association HAZMAT Team on emergency response activities. \n\nThe facility has a windsock present onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nResponders receive HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction, on the job training and drills. HAZWOPER training includes the first responder awareness level, the first responder operations level and hazardous materials technician training.  Responder HAZWOPER training also include"
