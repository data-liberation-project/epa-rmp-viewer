Arkansas Eastman is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates that are used by Eastman's customers in a variety of consumer products ranging from paints and coatings, to prescription medicines, to household detergents.  Arkansas Eastman has RMP regulated flammables consisting of acetaldehyde, ethyl mercaptan, and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, crotonaldehyde, oleum (20% and 30%), anhydrous hydrogen chloride and formaldehyde (37% and 50%), which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\nArkansas Eastman has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care?, and through our recognition by OSHA as a \"STAR\" site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and mantaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n \nHazard Assessment Results\nAll covered processes at Arkansas Eastman are regulated as Program 3.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a flammable substance at Arkansas Eastman is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full storage tank of propylene (1-propene).

There are no off-site consequences associated with this scenario. To reduce the potential for an incident, several layers of protection are in place to minimize the effects of both the worst case and alternative case propylene scenarios.  These layers of protection include: 1) a water deluge system that provides fire protection for the unloading station and storage tanks, 2) an emergency shutdown switch in the control room, and 3) sensors to detect any leaks. \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with toxic substance processes at Arkansas Eastman is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a railcar of chlorine.  There are numerous controls in place that minimize the potential for such an incident and also to manage consequences if one should occur.  However, no credit for these controls is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  When such controls are not considered, the effects of this scenario could have an off-site impact based on EPAs OCA Guidence (RMP Comp Ver 1.06).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a failure of the one-inch discharge line between the emergency discharge shutdown valve and the chlorine vaporizer that supplies the production facility. There are no off-site consequences associated with this scenario. Several layers of protection are in place to reduce the potential for and to minimize the effects of both the worst case and alternate case chlorine scenarios.
