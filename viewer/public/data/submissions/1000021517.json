This\ncommitment is inherent in our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such\nas design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at\nhand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Ottawa\nCounty LEPC, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nLeprino Foods Company (LFC) operates a cheese and whey manufacturing facility. The plant is located at\n4700 Rich Street, Allendale, Michigan. LFC maintains one 112R listed substance in a regulated quanity on\nsite. Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS # 7664-41-7, is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing process\nThe maximum intended physical inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia located at the LFC plant is approximately\n81,172 lb.\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nLeprino Foods Co. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. The Ammonia refrigeration process is the only\nprocess at our facility that is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The following\nsections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nLepr"
