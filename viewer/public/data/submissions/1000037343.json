Mammoth Pacific is extremely diligent in the handling of isobutane and n-butane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Mammoth Pacific staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using isobutane/n-butane for geothermal power production. Mammoth Pacific has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Isobutane System. Mammoth Pacific's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of isobutane/n-butane. \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nMammoth Pacific's geothermal power production facility is fueled by geothermal brine from nearby Casa Diablo Hot Springs, located in Mammoth Lakes, California, approximately 5 miles east of the City of Mammoth Lakes and 0.5 miles east of State Route 395. The area around the facility is rugged and generally uninhabited. The facility uses isobutane and n-butane as a binary working fluid in a Rankine cycle for power production. There are a total of three plants in the facility: G1 (Mammoth Pacific I, MP I); built in 1984 and repowered in 2013, and plant G2 (Mammoth Pacific II, MP II) and G3 (Pacific Lighting Energy Systems I, PLES I), built in 1990. Mammoth Pacific Limited Partnership is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ormat. The facility utilizes hot geothermal brine as an energy source in a binary Rankine cycle with isobutane or n-butane as the working fluid. Thermal energy from the brine is transferred to the working f"

The site is currently operated by Mammoth Pacific staff and is manned 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 21 personnel.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substance managed at the Facility is isobutane and n-butane as the working fluid. The working fluid participates in a closed-loop power cycle, traveling through accumulators, pumps, heat exchangers, turbines, and condensers in order to produce electricity. The maximum intended inventory is 405,000lbs of isobutane and 155,189 lbs of n-butane, the majority of which is contained in the plant accumulators.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary Scenario Description:\n\nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for each of the two geothermal power production systems. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Two alternative release scenarios were modeled. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab 2 of the CalARP Submittal Binder. \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough the use of isobutane or n-butane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Mammoth Pacific has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the vapor cloud explosion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an eve"

In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a motive fluid release:\n\n?Automatic / Manual Shutdown\n\n? Well Designed Relief System\n\n? Perimeter Deluge System\n\nThe history of the Mammoth Pacific facility (i.e., no CalARP-applicable working fluid releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Power Generation  System.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the Mammoth Pacific facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of isobutane and n-butane as the working fluid. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility's maximum intended inventory of isobutane and n-butane is over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantities. As a result, the working fluid covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3 and Cal/OSHA PSM.\n\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n? Process Safety Information\n\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n\n? Operating Procedures\n\n? Training\n\n?Mechanical Integrity\n\n?Management of Change\n\n?Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?Compliance Audits\n\n?Incident Investigation\n\n?Employee Participation\n\n? Hot Work Permit\n\n?Contractors\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of working fluid at the Mammoth Pacific facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nMammoth Pacific staff are not First Responders.

Mammoth Pacific has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders. An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 ?3220 is in place.\n\nExternal Events Analysis Information:\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:\n\nThe types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.\n\nDuring the June 2009 PHA and the 2013 addendum to the PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team. General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of working fluid was addressed. The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, vehicle impact and landslide. The magnitudes of the external events considered are detailed within the PHA Worksheets and were qualitatively risk-ranked by the PHA Team. A seismic assessment was performed in October 2009 and an addendum assessment completed for MP-1 in 2013.\n\nThe most recent field verification of equipment was conducted on 04/23/2009 for MP II/PLES I and 11/15/2013 for MP I.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study has been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the June 3, 2009 PHA Report and November 2013 addendum. Any outstanding recommendations will be addressed by December 2013.\n\n"
