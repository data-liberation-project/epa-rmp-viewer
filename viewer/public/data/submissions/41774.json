AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA SITE  (b)\nThe City of St. Augustine Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 employs 11 full-time employees engaged in Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 and field operations.  Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\nSITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of St. Augustine Utilities Department.  The site is located at 501 Riberia Street,, St. Augustine, St. Johns County, Florida.  The site is located in a block area, boarded by (ICW) Intercoastal Waterway on the east, San Sebastian River on the west, Cerro Street on the north and San Sebastian River on the south.\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control distribution system that is contained in a special process room of the wastewater plant building.  The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\nREGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of St. Augustine chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for discharge back into the environment.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed through two parallel process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rat"

The maximum intended inventory is 14,000 pounds equivalent to 7 one ton containers.\nWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  ?\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a ?worst case release?.  The second is a more probable ?alternative release scenario?.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that ?the ? shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10 minutes?  due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario?.  \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint.?  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\nWORST CASE   ?(1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the RMP Comp and EPA guidelines for chlorine.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint which is part of the process safety information.

A map depicting this radius and area was defined by the recent Process Hazards Analysis and is part of the process safety information.\nALTERNATIVE CASE   ?(2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in either the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Modeling using the RMP Comp and EPA?s  water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 30.0 lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is 0.10 miles.  The residential population that would be impacted by this release is estimated at zero.  A map depicting this radius and enclosed area is included in the facility RMP Safety Information.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM  (d)\nThe City of St. Augustine accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA?s PSM program and EPA?s RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City-wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 site program.  The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program.  This is coordinated with the City of St. Augustine Fire/Rescue Department, police Department and St. John?s County Haz Mat Team.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. An overview of the generally written programs is listed below:\nThe City of St. Augustine has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \nThe document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \nTraining is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.

All the vent air and any fumes are diluted and then removed from the room by the vent system.\nEquipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor. This system is only inches long leading from the chlorine container to the pressure regulator bolted to the container.  \nThe low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive pressure in it.  There is a pressure relief valve in this system which opens if the pressure in the line reaches above atmospheric pressure.  There is a chlorine monitor that detects the presence of chlorine in the storage area and another one in the control building room.  The alarms and lights in the plant alert employees of a potential chlorine leak, plus a signal which reads out in the operation control room.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThe City of St. Augustine Riberia Street plant had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years per EPA 40 CFR 67.42 (a). \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM  (f)\nEmergency response procedures are contained in the Plant Emergency Response Policy and are coordinated with the City of St. Augustine Contingency Plan (Emergency Response Plan).
