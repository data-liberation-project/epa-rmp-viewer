Sam Kane Beef is a leader in developing and implementing new beef processing technologies in an effort to provide customers with the highest possible quality meats and services.  The facility processes beef for distribution to thousands of customers throughout the United States and many foreign countries.  To maintain product quality and freshness, during processing and storage, the inventory is kept either refrigerated or frozen.  Cooling is achieved through the use of three ammonia refrigeration systems containing a significant quantity of ammonia within the system's boundary.\nAmmonia contained within the refrigeration systems is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At Sam Kane Beef Processors, Inc., the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\nSam Kane Beef Processors is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the Emergency 911 phone system.\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\nSam Kane Beef Processors is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager along with the Plant Maintenance Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.
