Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the C&S Wholesale facility located in York, Pennsylvania to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. is located at 4875 Susquehanna Trail, in York, Pennsylvania.  The facility is approximately 0.25 miles north of Interstate 94.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas.  Construction of the ammonia refrigeration system at C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.'s York facility was completed in late August 2006.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\n\nThe primary business of C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 28,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressur"

Typical operating conditions range from 1.7 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 170 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed w"

      "SummaryText": "ith several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at 25 and 300 ppm in the Engine Room, and 25 ppm in the dock, penthouse and ice room areas.  When the detectors alarm, they terminate the supply of ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred.  This prevents the quantity released from escalating.  An off-site alarm company (Honeywell) monitors the ammonia detection system 24 hours a day.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York Maintenance Director.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 pounds within the last five years (August 2006 - August 2011). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuatio"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York safety committee completed these recommendations as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, a What-If / Checklist study, was completed on August 23, 2011. Recommendations resulting from the study have a due date of 12 months from the study or 8/23/2012."
