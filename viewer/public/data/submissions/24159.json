      "SummaryText": "accidents.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., Portland facility is located at 6400 N.W. Front Avenue, Portland, Oregon. The facility manufactures chlorine, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen, and sodium chlorate by continuous electrolytic processes.  Hydrochloric acid is also produced at the site.  Chlorine is present above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and is regulated at the site under 40 CFR Part 68, the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of the largest chorine storage vessel.  Chlorine is stored as a liquid in a tank which is administratively limited to a maximum of 350 tons, and this quantity was assumed to be released over 10 minutes in the worst-case scenario.  The administrative controls are reinforced in written operating procedures and by a weight alarm on the tank.  Although this scenario has an offsite impact, it should be noted that regulatory agencies and ATOFINA recognize that the worst-case scenario is an extremely unlikely event.\n\nWorst-Case Mitigation Measures\n\nMultiple layers of preventive measures make it very unlikely that a significant chlorine release will occur.  The storage vessel is a thick walled steel tank with concrete foundations supported by numerous piling driven into the ground to refusal at a basalt layer.  The tank receives a complete internal inspection at least every two years. The tank is surrounded by a concrete containment structure which would limit the spread of chlorine.\n\nActive mitigation systems cannot be considered in determining the impacts of the worst-case scenrio, but active mitigation measures should effectively reduce the risk associated with an RMP incident.  These measures include:\n\n-The chlorine storage vessel is surrounded by area chlorine monitors which continuously provide information to chemical operators.  The monitors provide an"

This tank is always empty and is not used for normal storage.  Chlorine can be pumped from the damaged tank into the emergency tank to reduce the amount potentially released.\n\n-A continuous monitoring system keeps the operators informed of the weight of product in the tank.  The tank is normally kept from near empty to approximately 12% full.  The tank is rarely ever filled over 30%.  Several times a day the operators transfer the contents of the vessel to railcars for shipment.\n\n-A pressure relief system is provided for the tank which utilizes pressure relief valves, a buffer tank, and an absorption/scrubbing system.\n\n-Excess flow valves are provided on the tank pumps.\n\n-A pressure relief system is provided on the tank to capture and neutralize vapors.\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is the failure of a chlorine railcar loading hose. This scenario was selected based on input from the plant's employees and from the plant's Community Advisory Panel.  Although the Alternative Release Scenario is somewhat more likely than the Worst Case Scenario, the magnitude of the Alternative Release Scenario selected is still an unlikely event.  The Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., to reduce the risk of this event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  Mitigation Measures\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenario is, by definition, more likely than the Worst-Case Scenario, it is still very unlikely given the facility's prevention program. ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., has an array of prevention and mitigation measures to prevent the release or reduce the potential  impact of the release.  Examples of the prevention and mitigation measures include:\n\n-The chlorine railcar loading hoses are replaced and the piping is inspected"

These monitors can activate an alarm system which will warn operators of any leak in the area.  The monitors can also activate an automatic shutdown system which will shut off the loading pump, and secure the transfer piping and the railcar.\n\n-A system is provided on the chlorine railcar so that if movement is detected, the automatic shutdown system will activate to secure the transfer piping and the railcar.\n\n-The automatic shutdown system can also be manually activated by pushing a button either at the railcar loading station, or remotely from another building.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazadous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard  (29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA Risk Management Program.  The prevention program covers those processes that handle chlorine.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n-In-depth process hazards analyses are completed and revalidated every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n-Written operating procedures (kept up-to-date) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n-Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n-A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly;\n\n-A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n-Critical equipment and chlorine piping are inspected on a p"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Worst-Case Scenario\n\nMeasures that would prevent a chlorine storage tank failure center on the design, construction, and inspection of the tank.  These measures include:\n\n-The chlorine storage tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry standard materials of construction.\n\n-Chlorine pressure vessels are inspected both as part of the plant's Mechanical Integrity Program and by authorized inspectors in accordance with the State of Oregons's Boiler and Pressure Vessel rules.\n\n-The risk of over-filling is addressed by using a scale alarm.\n\n-The risk of over-pressure is addressed by a system relief valves which are connected by piping to buffer tanks.  The buffer tanks are connected to a chlorine absorption/scrubbing system.\n\n-Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tank of vehicular damage or sabotage.\n\n-No flammable materials are allowed near the chlorine tank.

The most likely cause of such a failure would be for the railcar to be moved while the loading hose is still connected.  Prevention steps for this scenario include:\n\n-During loading a derail mechanism is set in front of the railcar which prevents other railcars from entering the loading area.\n\n-Rail stops (or wheel chocks) are used to prevent movement of the car.\n\n-A sign placed on the tract ahead of the railcar and a blue flashing light indicate the railcar is being loaded.\n\n-ATOFINA Chemicals, Inc., carefully controls the railroad switch crew and prohibits hooking up to a railcar that is still connected to the loading system.\n\n-A motion sensor on the railcar will activate the automatic shutdown system for railcar loading.  The loading pump will automatically shut off, and the transfer pipe and railcar will be secured.\n\n-Chlorine monitors in the loading area can also activate the automatic shut down system.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nFrom the beginning of 1994 to the present, there have been only four accidents/releases of chlorine that meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  Three releases each involved less than one pound of chlorine gas with no offsite impacts.  In 1997, a failed piping connection at the railcar loading area resulted in a release of 105 pounds of chlorine.  The only reported effect outside the plant was odor, which was noticed at an adjacent industrial site.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nA written emergency response plan is maintained at the facility.  The plan was developed in cooperation with the local emergency responders.
