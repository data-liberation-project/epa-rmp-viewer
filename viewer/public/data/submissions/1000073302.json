It stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, the facility also stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline.  Butane is stored above threshold quantity therefore this process is subject to both the PSM and RMP regulations.  The facility is still being constructed.  Once finished, the blending process will consist of butane storage in 2 spheres, blending pumps and associated piping for a total of 8,336,309 pounds of butane.  The RMP is being submitted prior to introducing butane into the facility above threshold quantity.  RMP corrections and updates will be made as appropriate as various phases of construction are completed.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nMagellan has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  Resources have been and will continue to be invested in accident prevention including personnel training, procedure development, design standards and preventative maintenance.\r\n\r\nIf an emergency were to occur, the LEPC would be contacted and requested to respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\r\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e include those utilized as safeguards in the PHA.  There could potentially be other process controls used in the process.  The process does not have any trade secrets.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe facility has not begun operations and therefore has not had any accidents requiring reporting under the RMP rule.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe facility is considered to be a non-respond"

Recommendations from these PHAs will be incorporated into the design and construction as appropriate.  Should any additional phases be planned, PHAs will also be conducted."
