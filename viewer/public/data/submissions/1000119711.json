Feed grade amino acids and feed grade Algal Oil are used in animal feed to improve the nutritional content of the animal feed. The amino acids and Algal Oil are manufactured using an industrial fermentation process. The primary raw material for the fermentation process is glucose, which is derived from corn. The amino acids are extracted, purified, and packaged for distribution throughout North America. Some products are exported to foreign countries. Algal Oil is extracted, separated, and packaged and distributed only in North America. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, which is covered under the EPA Risk Management Plan, is used at the Heartland Ingredients facility. Ammonia is used for pH control in the fermentation process and in the extraction process of amino acids. \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Our Facility\n\nAjinomoto Heartland Ingredients is committed to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment from the risks associated with the use of hazardous industrial chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia. \n\nWe have taken steps to ensure that anhydrous ammonia is handled safely at our facility. Mechanical systems are inspected and tested to ensure safe and proper operations. Our employees are trained in the safe handling of ammonia and are required to take computer-based training and hands on. Approximately 12% of our employees have been trained to the HazMat Technician level, which allows quick response to any chemical release situation that may develop. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nRegarding anhydrous ammonia, Heartland Ingredients is regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP).
