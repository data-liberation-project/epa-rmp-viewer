      "SummaryText": "The Jamestown Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in Jamestown, Russell County, Kentucky.  The facility maintains a 12,000 pound chlorine system and a 8,000 pound sulfur dioxide system for the purpose of treating wastewater collected from the surrounding area.  The facility stores greater than the 2,500 pound threshold for chlorine and 5,000 pound threshold for sulfur dioxide, requiring the development and submittal of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the USEPA.  For the purposes of risk management planning, this RMP was written in accordance with  \"Program III\" requirements.\n\nThere have been no incidents involving either the chlorine system or the sulfur dioxide system in the last five years which presented any threat of personnel or property damage on or off the site.\n\nChlorine - The worst-case scenario for this facility, as specified in the CAA, is a release of approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine within 10 minutes followed by vapor cloud dispersion.  The radius of influence to the specified endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 0.90 miles based on modeling using RMP*Comp.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine due to a cross-threaded coupling after container replacement.  The release, if unnoticed by the operator, would occur over approximately 60 minutes, followed by plume dispersion.  Based upon Class C atmospheric conditions, the toxic vapor cloud is predicted to extend 0.40 miles (712 yards) based on the ALOHA modeling program.\n\nSulfur Dioxide - The worst-case scenario for this facility, as specified in the Rule, is a release of approximately 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide within 10 minutes followed by vapor cloud dispersion.  The radius of influence to the specified endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L is 1.30 miles based on modeling using RMP*Comp.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide due to a cross-threaded coupling after container replacement.

Based upon Class C atmospheric conditions, the toxic vapor cloud is predicted to extend 0.59 miles (1,032 yards) based on the ALOHA modeling program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In each of these four scenarios, offsite receptors are affected.  There are no administrative controls or mitigation measures in use that could reduce the predicted effects, however, the chlorine system is contained within a building which serves to impede the rate of dispersion of the gas.\n\nEmergency notification will be made by telephone from the Jamestown Wastewater Treatment Plant by dialing 911.  This call ties to the Russell County DES/LEPC system which is designated as the responding agency for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The facility is covered in the LEPC planning documents and has a TAB-Q-7 on file withe the agency.  Plant personnel are not responsible for emergency notification, evacuation or alarm procedures at the plant beyond 911/Russell County DES notification.  The Russell County DES is the sole responsible agency. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis of these systems is conducted at least once every five years by Jamestown Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The Process Safety Management Program is located in Appendix H.  There are currently no known system deficiencies and no planned changes to the current standard operating procedures or safety protocols of either system."
