Many of the reports and information have only recently been developed.  Given that Husker Ag, L.L.C. is a new facility, there has been constant review and revisions to reports and information prior to the start up of the facility.  On the same note, there has never been a change in management.  The management is \"new\" and therefore, the \"new\" management was implemented with the construction of the facility.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nHusker Ag, L.L.C. has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nHusker Ag, L.L.C.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance:\n\nHusker Ag, L.L.C. ethanol plant is located in Plainview, Pierce County, Nebraska.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is Natural Gasoline, also known as Denaturant.  Husker Ag, L.L.C. has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of denaturant stored on site.\n\nOff-site Consequences Analysis Results:\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 148,512  pounds of denaturant.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from entire denaturant tank.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles from the denaturant tank.  There are no public receptors within the 0.4 mile radius.\n\nAlthough Husker Ag, L.L.C. has numerous contr"

      "SummaryText": "ols in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 1, no Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was required.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nHusker Ag, L.L.C. has constructed a new ethanol facility and startup was conducted during the week of March 3, 2003.  As such, there have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management programs during Husker Ag, L.L.C. ownership.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nHusker Ag, L.L.C. ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of the facility activities.  Husker Ag, L.L.C.'s corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\nA safety inspection and a review of the facility's emergency response plan is pending."
