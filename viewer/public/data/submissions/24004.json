Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at P & W, Inc. in Tekamah are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental\nsafety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Tekamah Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Tekamah (Figure 1, ammonia).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (78,734 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 18,000-gallon tank located at our facility in Tekamah (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 15,300 gallons (64,612 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (78,734 pounds) in ga"

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and urban topography, the maximum distance to\na toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 4.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 4.2-mile\nradius of this facility is 2,500.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 11,873.12 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of\n30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 900.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the propane\nstorage tank (64,612 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.  At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.32\nmiles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result\nin serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.32-mile radius\nof this facility is 900.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  Under neutral weather\nconditions, the maximum distance to a lower flammability endpoint of 35 mg/L at a release rate of \n5,000 pounds per minute is less than 0.06 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.06-\nmile radius of this facility is 50.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nPro"
