      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan (RMP) Executive Summary\nMidwest Renewable Energy, LLC (MRE)\nSutherland, NE\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\nMRE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  MRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, MRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances\nThe plant is located about 2 miles east of Sutherland, Nebraska and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in an 18,500-gallon aboveground storage tank.  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of a regulated substance (butane and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.  This RMP is submitted to cover denaturant stored at MRE.\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\nThe worst case scenario at the facility is release of the entire contents of the 18,500-gallon denaturant storage tank followed by ignition of the resulting vapor cloud.  The worst case vapor cloud explosion generates a 1 psig over-pressure endpoint about 0.3 mile from the center of the plant.  There are no public or environmental receptors or population centers within this distance.  Although MRE has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation meaures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  No Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) was evaluated since the facility meets Program 1 RMP requirements.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nMRE began operations at the plant on September 1, 2004 and has experienced no accidents that resulted in significant off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Respons"

      "SummaryText": "e Program Information\nMRE's Safety Compliance Manual and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control (SPCC) Plan incorporate emergency response requirements.  These documents are updated as necessary.  The Safety Compliance Manual includes Emergency Notification and Contingency Planning, Emergency Fire Protection & Prevention Plan, and Spill Prevention/Reaction Plan sections.  The SPCC Plan addresses spill prevention and response activities.  Employee training is required.\n\nEnvironmental Management System\nAgate Environmental has created a secure Internet website (SharePoint) where MRE stores and manages environmental requirements.  SharePoint is populated with current and historical compliance records, permits, photographs, data forms, equipment specifications, correspondence, and other pertinent information.  Forms are created to manage the flow of information from the plant to SharePoint and tasks are assigned to MRE personnel."
