      "SummaryText": "Farmers Union Oil Company is an independent company serving the Day County area.  The facilities owned and operated by the company include the anhydrous ammonia retailing facility concerned in the Risk Management Plan.  This facility is located on the northwest edge of the city of Pierpont, South Dakota.\n\nThe only substance present at this site in a large enough quantity to be subject to the Risk Management Rule is anhydrous ammonia, which is stored at the site prior to sales to independent consumers.  It is contained in one large tank which has a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons.  Administrative policy at the facility dictates that the tank never be filled above 82% of maximum capacity.  Therefore, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that will ever be present at the site is 24,600 gallons or 140,000 pounds.  It must also be noted that this maximum amount is normally present for a short period of time, when seasonal demand for this product is likely to be high.\n\nThe site is located near the edge of the city of Pierpont, which has a population of roughly 175 people.  The area immediately surrounding the site contains both residential and light commercial facilities.  The main residential areas of Pierpont lie to the southeast of the site.  The areas beyond the city limits in all directions are primarily agricultural lands which are sparsely populated.\n\nThe facility has an excellent safety record.  No reportable accidents or incidents as referred to in the data elements have occurred within the past five years.  This safety record is the result of the priority that safety is given at the facility.  The small number of employees who handle anhydrous ammonia make it easier to ensure that proper training is provided and proper procedures are followed.  Any new employees, or employees who may be switching to new duties, are provided with a combination of classroom and on-the-job training.  They are then observed closely over the initail months of employment at the f"

      "SummaryText": "acility by the facility management to ensure proper job performance.  Any knowing violation of safe working procedures is not tolerated.  Safety meetings are conducted periodically.  Safety and emergency response plans are prepared in house and updated periodically.  Inspection of equipment at the facility are also periodic.\n\nThe major hazard at the facility is the release of anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere.  Some of the scenarios which could lead to this are equipment failure, damage to the tank from external sources (collision, etc.) corrosion of the tank and/or valves and piping, overfilling and/or overpressurization, and failure of transfer mechanisms.  However, the possibility of these occurring is limited by the presence of such safety features as relief valves, check mechanisms are also locked closed when not in use.\n\nThe emergency response program for the facility is coordinated with the Day County LEPC.  It includes actions to be taken in case of a release, emergency health care information, and an extensive contact list for informing the public and local agencies.  The plan is reviewed periodically.  Facility personnel receive training for emergency response in order to minimize any delays in dealing with an accidental release.  Personal protective equipment is maintained at the site and employees are trained in its use.\n\nIn summary, Farmers Union Oil Company has an excellent safety record.  However this record has not resulted in complacency.  Management and employees are dedicated to performing their duties safely and have demonstrated that they are willing to comply with all applicable standards and guidelines.  Changes in record keeping and reporting required under the RMP  Rule will be implemented in the facility safely plan.  No additions or facility modifications are planned at this time."
