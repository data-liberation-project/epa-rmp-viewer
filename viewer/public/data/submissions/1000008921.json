No credit is taken for administrative controls to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore in modeling the WCS is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS reaches an offsite public receptor.  Although there are controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS, consistent with the requirements of the RMP guidelines. The alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Mobile Site is a VCE resulting from the release of butane from a gasket leak.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10   minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event does not reach offsite receptors.    The plant does not produce or store regulated toxic materials above the threshold quantity limit, thus no toxic WCS or ARS are addressed in this executive summary and RMP Plan."

The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant\u00c2\u00bfs process units.  Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating pr"

Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\nOperator Training\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics.    \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place.

Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.
