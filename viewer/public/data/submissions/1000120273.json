      "SummaryText": "ADK RNG, LLC (ADK) operates a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) processing facility  that generates RNG from recovered biogas emitted from a manure digester.  The Digester generates biogas which is fed into a cleanup and upgrading facility to create RNG.  The RNG is created by increasing the methane content by removing water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other impurities.  After upgrading, the RNG is compressed and loaded into transportation trucks for delivery to an injection point where it enters a commercial supply pipeline.  The RNG transportation trucks are referred to as a \u0093virtual pipeline\u0094.  The RNG is also known as biomethane.  RNG is pipeline quality natural gas nearly identical to traditional natural gas and can be used for heating, cooking and other processes.  \n\nMethane (CAS 74-82-8) is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning (RMP) Rule, 40 CFR 68, as a flammable substance. The RMP Rule has an evaluation threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for methane at a single applicable site. At the ADK facility, the maximum quantity of methane stored or processed at one time is 36,000 lbs.\nThis exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for methane in the RMP Rule, requiring an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for methane as a flammable substance.  The facility is located in a rural area typified by generally flat terrain with essentially no obstructions to wind in and around the facility.  As the ADK facility is subject to Subpart B of the RMP Rule and is considered a Program 1 applicable facility for methane, alternative cases are not required per the OCA guidance. Thus, the OCA for methane at the facility is complete with the presentation of the worst-case release from the virtual pipeline RNG trailer truck loading posts.  Endpoint distance for these effects of a vapor cloud explosion do not depend on assumed temperature, humidity, or wind.  Rather, per the OCA guidance, a TNT-equivalence model is used. The offsite consequence"

      "SummaryText": "analysis for the worst-case scenario is performed using the EPA model,  RMP*Comp, the OCA guidance methodology and assumptions for TNT equivalence are incorporated to calculate the endpoint to the 1 psi overpressure caused by a vapor cloud explosion of a specified quantity of a flammable substance. RMP*Comp is the US EPA developed and maintained OCA model and was designed to perform the offsite consequence analysis required under the RMP Rule using conservative methods to calculate the hazard endpoint for a distance to the endpoint.  The endpoint distance to the 1 psi overpressure represents the maximum is 0.2 miles measured from the truck loading area.  There are no residences nor any public or environmental receptors in this area beyond the property line. As the ADK facility is a Program 1 eligible facility with respect to methane, no alternative scenarios are considered and the OCA is complete."
