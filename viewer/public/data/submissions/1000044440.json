This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\nThe facility is located within on an industrial site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse; Receiving Area; Machinery Spaces; Production Areas; and Coolers. The facility produces pasteurized milk products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. Major refrigeration equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.).\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in everyday operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n  *  OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\n  *  Ammonia detection and alarm system in the machinery room.\n  *  Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n  *  Personal protective equipment.\n  *  Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work "

The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details response actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification of federal and state agencies. The plan includes \"Emergency Response to Anhydrous Ammonia,\" specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nThe facility is continually working to improve safety in all areas, as well as within the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements. The facility places a high emphasis upon training of personnel in the areas of safety and environmental awareness, compliance, and response."
