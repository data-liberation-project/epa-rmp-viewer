      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nMS HWY. 613 WATERWORKS BOOSTER STATION\nCITY OF MOSS POINT, MS\nESCATAWPA UTILITY DISTRICT\n\nThe EUD waterworks booster stationl site is located in the northeastern portion of Jackson County just east of the intersection of Mississippi Highways 613 and 63.  The site includes two water booster pumps, a ground storage tank,a small equipment building,  and two one-ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the booster station site is highly toxic gaseous chlorine stored in two one-ton steel tanks.  The chlorine is used to oxidize hydrogen sulfide in and disinfect the water before it is repumped into the northern portion of the EUD distribution system.\n\nThe chlorine in the steel tanks is stored under pressure and liquified.  An accidental release would result in gaseous chlorine escaping into the atmosphere.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and would tend to spread out near the ground surface.  Therefore, a large scale accidental release would represent a serious health and safety hazard to people and animal life in the area surrounding the well site.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThere are no workers assigned to booster station site on a full-time basis.  However, the site is monitored daily by EUD personnel.  During these short monitoring visits, chlorination equipment is checked for proper operation, leaks, or other malfunctions.  Any malfunctions posing health or safety hazards to the workers or the general public are immediately reported to public works headquarters by radio.\n\nPreventive maintenance activities are also undertaken periodically to replace deteriorating chlorination equipment. EUD recently initiated a program to place fiberglass enclosures over the chlorine cylinders and roller trunions under the cylinders.  The enclosures protect the cylinders, regulators, piping and related equipment from the elements and from physical damage.  Although the enclosures are not air"

      "SummaryText": "tight, they will assist in containing chlorine leaks.  The roller trunions allow a tank that is leaking to be rotated so that liquified chlorine is not spilled.  The booster station chlorine storage tanks are equipped with fiberglass enclosures and roller trunions.\n\nEUD personnel's emergency response to chlorine leaks is to immediately notify public works headquarters by radio and then make every effort to contain the accidental release.  Public works headquarters immediately notifies the Moss Point Fire Department (Fire Marshall is the Civil Defense Director).  The Moss Point Fire Department notifies the Jackson County LEPC, mobilizes the Moss Point Police Department, Jackson County Sheriffs Office, and the Moss Point Public Works Department.  These organizations immediately begin appropriate emergency actions such a public notification, isolation and evacuation of the danger area, and repair of the damaged chlorine facilities.\n\nWORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worse-case release scenario is based upon the rupture of one chlorine tank and the release of 2000 pounds of gaseous chlorine over a period of ten minutes at the rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The RMP/Comp computer program furnished by EPA notes that an area with a radius of three miles centered on the well site would be adversely impacted by this accidental release.  This impact area includes about al hundred  homes, several churches, small commercial establishements, and Mississippi Power Company's Plant Daniel Generating Station.\n\nThe 3-mile area around the booster station site would immediately be cordoned-off by law enforcement personnel and all people would be evacuated, except for properly equipped and protected emergency personnel.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY"
