The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park, Texas. Hexion sells resins & its precursors to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics and coatings to electronics and wind energy. About 150 full-time employees work at the site.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION AND POLICIES\r\n\r\nHexion is committed to the continuous improvement of chemical safety management. Hexion maintains Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facilities is safe for our workers, the public, and environment. As part of this commitment, Hexion invests resources in various areas of accident prevention, such as:\r\n\r\n* Safety in process design;\r\n* Safe operating policies and procedures;\r\n* A comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\r\n* Management of process changes;\r\n* Training;\r\n* Incident investigation and auditing; and\r\n* Emergency response participation.\r\n\r\nHexion works closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC).  Hexion is also committed to the principles outlined under the American Chemical Council's Responsible Care program.  \r\n\r\nThis document provides an overview of the risk management activities at Hexion, including:\r\n\r\n* A description of the facility and substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule (68.155(b))   \r\n* An overview of the Prevention Program to prevent accidental chemical releases (68.155(a) & (c))\r\n* A five-year history of accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule (68.155(d))\r\n* An overview of the emergency response program (68.155(e))\r\n* Planned changes to improve safety.

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the RMP regulation since the site is also required to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 1910.119 Process Safety Management regulations. The RMP regulated substances stored or processed at this facility include methyl mercaptan, epichlorohydrin and pentane.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nHexion's committed and engaged leaders and associates strive to create a safe environment for ourselves and the communities.  Part of our program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures. Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\r\n\r\n1. Release detection\r\n   Process alarms\r\n   Operator surveillance\r\n   Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \r\n\r\n2. Release containment and control\r\n   Relief systems designed to prevent equipment over-pressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\r\n   Dikes to contain liquid releases\r\n   Automatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\r\n\r\n3. Release Mitigation\r\n   Area firewater monitors\r\n   Mobile emergency response equipment\r\n   Trained emergency response personnel\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no releases of EPA covered chemicals at Hexion's Deer Park site in the past five years which have had an adverse impact on the community.  There has been one incident at the facility that triggered RMP reporting requirements with one employee injury.  The incident occurred December 2011.  An employee contacted epichlorohydrin and the resulting injury required time away from work.  Incident review sessions were held at the site to inform all personnel about the cause of the incident as well as preventative actions to take if there"

Hexion also works closely with the City of Deer Park's Department of Emergency Services and Harris County's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management (OHSEM).  \r\n\r\nThis coordination includes periodic meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members, and industry representatives. Shell and Hexion maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents. \r\n\r\nHexion also maintains 24 hour communications capability with relevant public agencies, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire department, local pollution control agencies, federal agencies, etc.).  Hexion Environmental, Health and Safety personnel are trained to make required notifications to the public agencies as well as to the public via the CAER phone line and emails to the Deer Park Community Advisory Council in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nHexion(through Shell) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment. This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, and personnel accountability plans. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Hexio"

The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility. Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.  The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\n2.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  PHAs are revalidated at least every 5-years by a team of process operators and unit engineers.\r\n\r\n3.  Following a maintenance turnaround or change implementation, Pre-Start-Up Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure that the process is safe to operate, procedures are in place and affected personnel are adequately trained to operate or maintain the process.\r\n\r\n4.  The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\n5.  Technical documents are maintained regarding the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, operating parameters and the design basis for the plant equipment.\r\n\r\n6.  Operating Procedures have been developed for each process area.  Operating Procedures are reviewed by unit operators, supervisors and engineers for accuracy. The procedures include steps for safe operation during all phases of operation.\r\n\r\n7.  Associate training includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) saf"

The site uses contractors to supplement its workforce during normal activity as well as turnarounds.  To ensure contractors are trained in the site procedures, Hexion works with the Houston Area Safety Council to develop and administer general as well as site specific training.  Meetings are regularly conducted between Hexion and Contractor Supervisors to share best-practices and learnings from industry related accidents.\r\n\r\n9.  Hexion investigates incidents, including near misses that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or could have caused damage to the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future.  The facility has a formal program in place for reporting incidents, conducting incident investigations, report generation, and tracking of actions resulting from incident investigations.\r\n\r\n10.  Hexion has an active plant safety committee that works to improve the health, safety, environmental and security of the facility.  The site also has a program for soliciting health, safety, environmental and security suggestions from plant employees.\r\n\r\n11.  An ongoing dialogue with Shell Deer Park and the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.
