Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\nThe Baton Rouge Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\nThe CWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the central area of the City's urban perimeter including the Louisiana State University campus, and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine and further treated with sulfur dioxide for removal of the residual chlorine.  The use of these two chemicals makes the CWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nChlorine.  The CWWTP has two 40,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank has a working capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons, or approximately 50,000 lb. of  liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The CWWTP receives sulfur dioxide in one-ton cylinders which are delivered by truck.  The cylinders are stored inside the sulfur dioxide building, a steel-frame and concrete structure that also houses a"

      "SummaryText": "ll of the major components of the dechlorination system.\n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nPart of the requirements of Section 112(r) is the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of the regulated toxic substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide).\n\nWorst Case Scenarios.  The WCS's associated with the CWWTP were assumed as follows:\n\n7 Chlorine: catastrophic failure of a chlorine storage tank, resulting in the release of the entire tank contents (50,000 lb.) within a period of 10 minutes, and \n\n7 Sulfur Dioxide: the total failure of an angle valve on a sulfur dioxide cylinder, resulting in the release of the entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lb.) within a period of 10 minutes.  \n\nThese worst-case scenarios are extremely unlikely to occur. Also, while these scenarios took into account that the chemicals are inside an enclosed building, they did not take into account other available mitigating conditions such as the existing leak detection devices and alarms and the existing emergency scrubber systems. Since the caustic scrubber is designed to capture the entire contents of a chlorine tank, it was necessary to assume, for the purposes of the Worst-Case Scenario, that a power failure would occur at the same time, which would make the scrubber system inoperable. (there is no emergency generator at the CWWTP). \n\nThe maximum distance to the chlorine toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L was calculated at 5.4 miles.  The maximum distance to the sulfur dioxide toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L was calculated at 0.9 miles.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios.  The ARS's associated with the CWWTP were assumed as follows:\n\n7 Chlorine:  Rupture or accidental disconnection of the chlorine truck unloading hose.  This would release chlorine gas from the loose hose for one minute, until the truck excess-flow valve is activated.  The amount of chlorine released under this scenario was estimated at approximate"

      "SummaryText": "ly 1,610 lb.\n\n7 Sulfur Dioxide:  Rupture of a metal tube connection on a sulfur dioxide cylinder.  This would cause the release of sulfur dioxide gas at an approximate rate of 30 lb. per min. and it would last for approximately 30 minutes until the Hazmat team arrived and closed the cylinder valve.  Total amount released was estimated at approximately 900 lb.\n\nThese scenarios are also unlikely but they represent a somewhat more realistic view of a hypothetical release.  Just as in the WCS, existing mitigating conditions were not taken into account in the development of this scenario.  It was also necessary to assume that the above scenarios would occur during a power failure.  Since the CWWTP has no emergency generator, the caustic scrubber system would not be operable when this release occurred.\n\nThe maximum distance to the chlorine toxic end point of 0.0087 mg/L  was calculated at 0.6 miles.  The maximum distance to the sulfur dioxide toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L was calculated at 0.1 miles.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n1.0\tSafety Information\n\nThe Central Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine and sulfur dioxide but caustic as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n\nThese documents include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n7 Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) for the chemicals involved\n7 Vendor's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manuals for each major component of the chlorination and dechlorination systems.\n7 A complete set of construction drawings and specifications\n7 A copy of the plant's Emergency Response Plan\n7 Copies of Shop Drawings and a"

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n2.0 \tHazard Review\n\nA review of the hazards associated with the operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems at the CWWTP was performed in the late Winter and early Spring of 1999.  The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and issued a report that presents and discusses the \"Action Items\" identified.  This report was submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action, if any, identified for each action item will be documented and retained on record for future reference.  Similar hazard reviews will be performed in the future, at least once every 5 years.\n\n3.0 \tOperating Procedures\n\nThe CWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.  These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up following emergency shut-downs, etc.  These procedures also address the removal of individual components from the process for inspection and/or maintenance and they discuss the consequences of deviations from the normal operating conditions and the steps to be followed to correct such deviations.\n\nThe plant's operating and maintenance procedures are reviewed and updated any time that the process undergoes a significant modification or improvement.\n\n4.0\tTraining\n\nAll of the employees involved in the operation of the chlorination and dechlorination system"
