      "SummaryText": "Wellman CO2 LLC owns the Wellman COFlex Plant. The plant is currently operated by Perdure Petroleum, LLC. The Wellman COFlex Plant receives flash gas from area producers. After cooling and dehydration, the flash gas is sent to a fractionation column to drop liquids from the gas stream (NGLs). The NGL product is then sent to an amine scrubber, stabilizer and then stored in two bullet tanks. The pressurized bullet tanks hold a maximum volume of 30,000 gallons, each with an operating pressure of ~200 psi.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 30,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the\r\nworse-case scenario for the Wellman COFlex Plant. The 30,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for\r\ntotal tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to\r\nendpoint of 0.4 miles. As per EPA's Marplot program, no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius\r\nof the NGL tanks. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site\r\nconsequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 level RMP under\r\n40 CFR 68. The Wellman COFlex Plant is located in a remote area and is normally occupied.\r\n\r\nThe facility started operations in June 2014 and there is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Wellman COFlex Plant occur, it is plant policy to notify the Brownfield Fire Department (or first available department through the 911 dispatch system) and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the local fire chief in Brownfield, TX."
