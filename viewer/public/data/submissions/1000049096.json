              "Description": "The Methylated Resins process employs a combination of engineering design, including instrumented controls, and administrative procedures to prevent releases of formaldehyde.  Examples of administrative controls include the capping and locking of unloading connections when not in use, as well as QC Lab testing to verify material before it is unloaded.  Examples of engineered controls include interlocked level instrumentation to prevent overfilling of storage tanks and secondary containment to capture any leaks that may occur from tanks or pumps.\n\nThe process also operates a Formaldehyde Distillation Column and Vapor Recovery Unit to recover formaldehyde for re-use.  These unit operations serve to minimize usage and air emissions of formaldehyde by recovering roughly 99% of this substance from the process.  This reduces the frequency at which bulk containers of fresh formaldehyde solution are purchased, transported into Kalamazoo and transferred to facility storage tanks.",

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nAllnex is a leader among chemical manufacturers in its safety, health and environmental programs.  Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Allnex's way of doing business.  Allnex has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  Allnex has also established a Safety, Health and Environmental management system to ensure the program is maintained and improved on an on-going basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b.) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nAllnex's Kalamazoo, Michigan facility has one process that involves one regulated substance.  The Methylated Resins process makes a product that is a key ingredient in the formulation of coatings for the automotive and other industries, and is used as an adhesive in rubber tire manufacturing.  \n\n\n\n(c.) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAllnex's general accidental release prevention program includes compliance with:\n\n\n\n -  EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\n -  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n -  MI-OSHA Part 91, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n\n -  Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\n -  Generally recognized and accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n\n -  Allnex Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\n\n\nThe process uses a combination of engineering and administrative controls to help prevent releases of the regulated substance.\n\n \n\n(d.) 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents at the Kalamazoo Plant that meet the criteria for reporting in the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\n(e.)
