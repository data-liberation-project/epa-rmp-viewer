To strive for a coordinated and affective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is however a single person identified who has overall responsibility for the PSM and RMP.  Program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and both systems requirements.  The entire program is scheduled to be reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is created to address any recommendation to improve any program elements.  A process hazard analysis has been done for the entirety of both systems, and the hazard analysis will be repeated every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated and all recommendations from the hazard analysis are addressed to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  It is Olympic Fruit Co. LLC. intent that the PSM/RMP for the facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  It is expected that by following the work practices that are implemented at the facility only incidental releases of ammonia will occur due to routine maintenance procedures, or normal equipment wear and tear. \n\nThis facility is used for the storage and packing of fruits, using ammonia as the refrigerant for the cold storage rooms and areas.\n\n\n\nRelease Considerations\n\nFollowing program guidelines a AA?Worse CaseAA? release of ammonia was analyzed for both systems.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential conce"

The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \n\n\n\nFive year release history AA? No Releases\n\nBoth systems have not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  If an actual release occurs or even a near miss, an incident investigation is done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\nOlympic Fruit Co. LLC. has a written AA?Emergency Action PlanAA? that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Company personnel have been trained in notification and evacuation procedures.  The refrigeration operators will do only AA?defensiveAA? actions to control and contain an ammonia release as much as possible without endangering themselves.  Olympic Fruit Co.L.L.C.. has also coordinated with  East Valley Fire Dept . and Moxee City Police Dept.\n\n\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n\nOlympic Fruit Co. LLC. holds monthly safety meetings with  Management Staff, Lead Personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety and operational improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.  Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated; in many cases annually, to assure that all operations are being done in a safe and effective manner and operating procedure will continue to be developed and improved.\n\n"
