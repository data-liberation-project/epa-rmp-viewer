Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Sysco New Orleans are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with Jefferson Parish Fire Department which provide our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nSysco New Orleans utilizes an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at Sysco New Orleans. The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia that is expected to be present in this system is 18,000 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nSysco New Orleans has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Sysco New Orleans is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nSysco New Orleans keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation for the ammonia refrigeration system.

PSI is available to all employees.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist Study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nSysco New Orleans maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\nSysco New Orleans has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees involved in the process receive basic training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nSysco New Orleans carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
