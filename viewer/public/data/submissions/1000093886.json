The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The Maund CGF-B has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\r\n\r\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through WES' Near Miss and Observation programs.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThere is no accident history to report. Should an emergency involving the Maund CGF-B NGL system occur, it is the WES policy to notify the Dimmit and Webb County Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department."

      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies for the Maund CGF-B, which is owned and operated by Western Midstream (WES). Because there are employees at the facility more than 4hrs./day, the station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\r\n\r\nWES has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. WES has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. WES' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies. If the situation requires, WES will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nLocation and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Maund CGF-B is a facility that receives gas via flow line. The gas is compressed to separate NGL, water and condensate. The gas is further processed involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which condenses the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in one pressurized bullet tanks, with a volume of 18,000 gallons and operating pressure of ~200 psi. A total rupture of the NGL tank resulting in a bleve would pose the worse-case scenario for the Maund CGF-B facility. The tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.4 miles. There are no public receptors are within a 0.4 mile radius of the NGL tank. The worst-case scenario would not affect anyone within the endpoint of the off-site consequence analysis. Therefore, this RMP has been e"
