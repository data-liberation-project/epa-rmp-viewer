ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES:  This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for LP Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  This facility is regularly inspected by the Alabama LP Gas Board (last full inspection: 3-23-05)\n2   DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  The primary purpose of this facility is to store and then distribute propane to wholesale customers.  Propane is used by our wholesale customers as a fuel.  The propane is received by transport (no railcars received since 2000) and stored in six (6) 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  Propane is distributed to wholesale customers by truck (transport and bobtails).  This facility has equipment for loading and unloading transports, unloading railcars (not used since 2000), and loading transports and bobtails.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is propane.\n3.  WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pull-away causing failure of a 20 foot length of 2 inch hose.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow of product in an accidental release of propane.  The contents of the hose would be released, resulting in an explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and loca"

The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and the Alabama LP-Gas Board Regulations and Alabama LP-Gas Laws.\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in place.\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Atalla Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:   Replacement of relief valves, excess flow valves, block valves, line valves, pressure gauges, thermometers, hydrostatic reliev valves; installation of fencing at compressor station and railcar unloading entrances.\n8.  This facility is only staffed by employees when product transfer is taking place."
