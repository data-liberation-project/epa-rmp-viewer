The ER team utilizes a fully equipped trailer that can be sent for emergencies outside the plant. On plant property a stand \u00bf alone building has been designated as a command post center where ER equipment is stored and emergencies can be addressed. It also includes all the key contact information to communicate to outside agencies and local authorities.\n\nThe Morrisville Plant also has an Off \u00bf Site Emergency Response Plan that is approved annually by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The plan details the essential actions to take should an emergency occur. \n\nThe Morrisville plant is also subject to the requirements of OHSA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program that calls for Hazardous Communication training for each employee. Other key elements of the PSM Program that the Morrisville plant utilizes are Management of Change and Pre Startup Safety Reviews.\n\nThe Morrisville Plant is also an active member of the local Community Mutual Aid Committee. This organization is comprised of local chemical companies and emergency service groups in the area such as the LEPC, fire departments, hospitals, and first aid squads. This organization provides a way to maintain communication between the groups and brings all members up to date on regulatory changes, l"

Included in the organization\u00bfs activities is an annual emergency response scenario drill that allows members to utilize their training. The scenario is followed with a critique of the event.\n\nThe Morrisville Plant has been ISO 9002 certified since 1994. It has been recently certied to the updated version of this standard called ISO 9001/ 2000. This is a certification of the quality system by an independent third party auditor which is performed on an annual basis. Key elements that must be adhered to with this standard and also directly enhance the safety performance of the plant include document control, training, calibration of process equipment, and traceability of product.\n\nCorporate headquarters recently conducted a Security Vulnerability Assessment Audit of the Morrisville Plant to ensure it has the appropriate security safeguards in place. An action plan was developed from the audit results to enhance the plant security and all these actions have been completed.\n\nThe Morrisville has had no reportable  accidental releases for the last 5 years. In addition, there has never been a lost time accident since the plant opened in 1990. \n\nThe Morrisville plant maintains an MSDS for all chemicals handled at the location. Employee training on product knowledge is accomplished through MSDS reviews, specific process training sessions, monthly safety meetings, and the review of standard operating procedures. All training is documented and tracked per the ISO 9001/ 2000 Standard and Hazardous Communication Program requirements.\n\nStandard operating procedures specify stringent leak testing  of cylinders and process systems. These leak tests include the use of a helium mass spec leak detector capable of seeing leaks beyond the ability of the human eye. This ensures that product will not be accidently released once it is introduced into a system or package.\n\nSafety teams comprised of Morrisville personnel"
