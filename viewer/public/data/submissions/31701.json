              "Description": "The Silane system incorporates several preventative actions that ensure a safe and leak free system.\nA visual inspection of the Silane system is carried out prior to each use of the system. Silane leakage will leave a white or brownish type staining (silicon dioxide powder) on the system components when the Silane comes in contact with air. Following the visual inspection a leak check is performed with high-pressure helium to the working pressure of the system. A final system check is the vacuum leak check. In this test the system must hold a certain level of vacuum for a specified amount of time in order to be certified leak-free.\nWhen the transfer of Silane is taking place from the bulk source only the required amount of bulk Silane product is allowed to be open for use. This minimizes the amount of Silane that could potentially escape should a leak occur. This also reduces the amount of time an operator would need to isolate the bulk source of Silane. The Silane operation is never left unattended while in use. At the end of each workday all sources of Silane are closed off and isolated.\nAll Silane filling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill condition to occur.\nThe Silane system is constructed with a minimal amount of threaded connections and is welded wherever possible. All piping material is 316L stainless steel. All valves on the Silane system incorporate a double seal design and offer the highest leak free integrity. Emergency shutdown buttons are strategically placed and allow the operator to quickly stop the flow of product should an emergency situation arise.\nSilane's greatest hazard is its fire potential. Silane is a pyrophoric gas that flames upon contact with air. The filling process takes place in a Class 1, Division II room. There is fire detection/suppression systems at the fill system and bulk source. In addition, the bulk source is staged in an area surrounded on three sides with fire walls.",

              "Description": "The Hydrogen Chloride system consists of a bulk source of product (tube trailer) which is piped a short distance into the plant where the filling of cylinders takes place.\n\nPreventative program elements are in place to ensure the Hydrogen Chloride system operates safely and maintains a leak  - free status.\nOn a daily basis the operator performs a visual inspection of the Hydrogen Chloride system looking for any signs of leakage which would be indicated with signs of corrosion, discoloration of system parts, or fuming. Prior to use, the system is subjected to a pressure test with helium up to the working pressure of the system. The system must be certified leak ? free prior to any introduction of Hydrogen Chloride into the system.\nThe Hydrogen Chloride bulk source is a tube trailer consisting of 6 tubes. However, during use only one tube is allowed to be open at a time. This policy restricts the amount of product in the system should a leak occur and also reduces the amount of time an operator would need to close and isolate the bulk source of product.\nThe hydrogen chloride is withdrawn from the tube trailer gas phase and not liquid phase. This greatly reduces the volume of product in the piping should a leak occur. At the end of each workday all tubes on the Hydrogen Chloride trailer are closed.\nHydrogen Chloride is a corrosive product. The entire fill system is constructed of 316L stainless and hastelloy components. These metals offer the highest resistance to hydrogen chloride corrosion. \n\nThe weight of hydrogen chloride in the bulk source is monitored as well as the weight of the cylinders being filled. These product weights are monitored with scales that under a calibration program.  This weight monitoring minimizes the potential to have overfilled cylinders.",

              "Description": "The Chlorine system utilizes a  2000 lb. container of chlorine source material and processes it through a purification system to produce a high  grade of finished product.\n\nThe Chlorine system is given a daily visual inspection prior to use for the purpose of detecting any leaks. Chlorine leaks would be evident from signs of corrosion and/or discoloration of the system parts. Also prior to each use the system is checked for leaks with helium. The system must be leak free prior to the introduction of Chlorine.\n\nThe Chlorine system is constructed of 316L stainless steel and hastelloy components to minimize any corrosion effects from chlorine. The system is made up primarily of welded connection with a minimal amount of threaded connections used.\n\nThe weight of the product is constantly monitored with calibrated scales to ensure there can never be an overfill condition of the product in the system or in the cylinders being filled. \n\nOperators constantly monitor the process when it is operating. Logs are kept to track the process and analyze the product.  The Chlorine system is contained entirely inside a process building. This passive mitigation results in a smaller dispersion distance of product should a  release ever occur.",

This type of activity is commonly referred to as repackaging. Therefore the Morrisville Plant?s activity is described as a  ?re-packager of compressed gases?.  \n\nThe Morrisville plant location fully supports the Responsible Care Program that Air Liquide has endorsed.\n\nThe Morrisville location maintains its own team of emergency responders to handle emergencies both on property as well as off property which includes customer sites. The ER team utilizes a fully equipped trailer that can be sent for emergencies outside the plant. On plant property a stand ? alone building has been designated as a command post center where ER equipment is stored and emergencies can be addressed. It also includes all the key contact information to communicate to outside agencies and local authorities.\n\nThe Morrisville Plant also has an Off ? Site Emergency Response Plan that is approved annually by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The plan details the essential actions to take should an emergency occur. \n\nThe Morrisville plant is also subject to the requirements of OHSA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program that calls for Hazardous Communication training for each employee. Other key elements of the PSM Program that the Morrisville plant utilizes are Management of Change and Pre Startup Safety Reviews.\n\nThe Morrisville Plant is also an active member of the local Community Mutual Aid Committee.

Key elements that must be adhered to with this standard and also directly enhance the safety performance of the plant include document control, training, calibration of process equipment, and traceability of product.\n\nCorporate headquarters recently conducted a Security Vulnerability Assessment Audit of the Morrisville Plant to ensure it has the appropriate security safeguards in place. An action plan was developed from the audit results to enhance the plant security and all these actions have been completed.\n\nThe Morrisville has had no reportable  accidental releases for the last 5 years. In addition, there has never been a lost time accident since the plant opened in 1990. \n\nThe Morrisville plant maintains an MSDS for all chemicals handled at the location. Employee training on product knowledge is accomplished through MSDS reviews, specific process training sessions, monthly safety meetings, and the review of standard operating procedures. All training is documented and tracked per the ISO 9001/ 2000 Standard and Hazardous Communication Program requirements.\n\nStandard operating procedures specify stringent leak testing  of cylinders and process systems. These leak tests include the use of a helium mass spec leak detector capable of seeing leaks beyond the ability of the human eye. This ensures that product will not be accidently released once it is introduced into a system or package.\n\nSafety teams comprised of Morrisville personnel"
