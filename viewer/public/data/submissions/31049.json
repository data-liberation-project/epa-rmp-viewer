P. facility located in Piedmont, South Carolina contains one RMP covered process with is a vinyl acetate polymer emulsions manufacturing plant.  The plant maintains greater than 10,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) to safely and efficiently manufacture polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions.  In the quantities handled by our facility, vinyl acetate monomer is considered to be hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations as well as our internal EH&S policies and practices.\nAir Products manages the safety of our facility by designing for a safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations.  Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulation and our emergency response program is based on OSHA?s HazWOPER regulations.\nAir Products is a member of the American Chemical Council and subscribes to the Responsible Care? Program.  The Piedmont Plant is actively involved in the community through its work with the local Greenville county CAER Group, the Piedmont Fire Department, the Greenville County LEPC and the Piedmont Community Advisory Panel.\n\n\nFacility description and regulated substance handled:\nThe polyvinyl acetate copolymer emulsions manufacturing facility is located at 410 Old Pelzer Road, Piedmont, South Carolina.  To produce polyvinyl acetate copolymer an emulsion, vinyl acetate liquid is polymerized with other monomers is reactors to form the emulsion product.  The emulsion product is a non-hazardous, water based liquid.  The product is shipped via railcars, tank truck, totes and drums to industrial customers for the production of paint products, paper coatings and adhesives.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThe Piedmont Plant?s RMP Accidental Release Prevention Program is ba"

At a minimum, all employees are trained to OSHA?s First Responder Awareness level.  Employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate an emergency response from outside agencies.  The facility also has a core group of employees who are trained to the Technician Level of HazWOPER.  Employees receive refresher training in emergency response procedures.  \nEmergency response activities have been coordinated with the Piedmont Fire Department for awareness on potential hazards and location of hazardous materials.  Drills are also conducted periodically in order to assure the effectiveness of the response procedures.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThere are no current plans to install new mitigation, control equipment of to change technology.  The plant does strive to continuously improve its performance in safety.  Process Safety Management elements are evaluated periodically for effectiveness."
