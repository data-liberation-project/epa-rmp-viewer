Main operations at the Hillshire Brands - Zeeland Facility include processing/packaging of turkey, chicken, beef, and pork products. In addition to processing meats, the Hillshire Brands - Zeeland Facility operates an automated breakfast bowls assembly and packaging line. Hillshire Brands has been in operation at this location since 1936 providing quality meat products.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nHillshire Brands is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. It is Hillshire Brands' policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and, as applicable, Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA's Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nHillshire Brands is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products. Hillshire Brands also operates freezers and coolers for product storage. Hillshire Brands uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the 592,451.34 sq.ft. facility within the required range of operating temperatures and to operate the freezers and coolers. Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants. Hillshire Brands' refrigeration system"

In addition, Hillshire Brands' ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted industry standards and good engineering practices.\n\nHillshire Brands has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding). \n\nHillshire Brands has developed standard operating procedures for all equipment in the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are recertified annually. Hillshire Brands encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of meetings and training sessions. Changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\nHillshire Brands understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Hillshire Brands has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed using a computer maintenance management software system to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.

Included in the SOP are measures to be taken internally by Hillshire Brands as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n  \nAs part of Hillshire Brands' continuous efforts to improve the safety of the system, we continue to implement system updates and modification - including equipment / piping replacements and relocations to safer locations.  We also continue to revise / update operating procedures as needed and perform regular ammonia safety training."
