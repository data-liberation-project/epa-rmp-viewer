The purpose of this Executive Summary is to provide a brief description of certain elements of the Risk Management Plan that has been implemented at the Marathon Kenai Refinery, located in Kenai, Alaska. The objectives of the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) are to prevent chemical accidents, mitigate their effects, enhance emergency response capabilities, promote public awareness, ensure regulatory compliance, and support continuous improvement in chemical safety.\n\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nThe Marathon Kenai Refinery (Refinery) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n2.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Marathon Kenai Refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from crude oil. The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane and butane. Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated substances using detailed engineering calculations.\n\nThe 2024 Resubmittal includes the 2021 PSM Audit - RMP - investigate discrepancy in flammable ARS and the 2024 separation of the Amine/Flare Gas Recovery Unit to individual units: Amine Unit and Flare Gas Recovery Unit.\n\n3.0 HAZ"

No mitigation measure was considered. Using the parameters mandated by regulations through RMP*Comp Program, this worst-case release has the potential to transverse a 1.2-mile radius from the point of release and the potential to affect the population of 267 people.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary for Flammables\n\nARS Scenario Description: The alternative release scenario selected was the inadvertent opening of a Flow Control Valve in the butane line to the Butane Storage Tank (TK-70) in the Tank Farm Unit, releasing 4,900 lbs. of butane, causing a vapor cloud explosion. No mitigation measures were considered. Using the parameters mandated by regulations through RMP*Comp Program, this alternative release has the potential to transverse 0.09-mile radius from the point of release but with no potential to affect the population.\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nAt Marathon we are proud of our safety performance. The Kenai Refinery has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969. In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the Refinery since 1969. \n\n5.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai Refinery. This program includes the required elements of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Refinery maintains technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. The documents address chemical properties and asso"

Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up to- date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Refinery has developed procedures for operating the processes within safe limits for temperature, level, composition, pressure, etc. The Refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform PHA evaluations.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA's are facilitated by someone with experience with the selected method. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measure and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team's findings are reviewed and resolved by local management. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures \n\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures are utilized by operators and maintenance personnel and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certifi"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on computers located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures. \n\nTraining \n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or working within an RMP-covered process. New employees receive 40 hours of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) basic training. Personnel in refinery operations receive an additional six weeks of job-specific training. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-related duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating adequate skill and knowledge in that specific process. All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. All refinery employees are trained on Safe Work Practices in accordance with the Work Practice Training Matrix. \n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nThe Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain"

The basic aspects of this program include: \n\n(1) Conducting training; \n(2) Developing written procedures; \n(3) Performing inspections and tests; \n(4) Correcting identified deficiencies; and \n(5) Applying quality assurance measures. \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. The written procedures help ensure work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: \n\n(1) An overview of the process; \n(2) Safety and health hazards; \n(3) Applicable maintenance procedures; \n(4) Emergency response plans; and \n(5) Applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment are within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a team of subject matter experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nManagement of Change (MOC) \n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. PSSR is integrated into the Management of Change (MOC) program and is required for every MOC. \n\nCompliance Audits \n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by a Corporate approved/appointed audit team, or a third-party consulting firm mixed with Marathon personnel from across the Corporation.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. \n\n(1) Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery Safety Program. \n(2) Regularly held safety meetings in each department are one way in which employees are able to participate in the review and development of programs and work practices. \n(3) An Employee Safety Steering Committee was established to promote employee feedback and participation.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered processes at the Kenai refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors. \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Refinery has safety features on many units to help contain and control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes: \n\nRelease Detection \n\n(1) Portable hydrocarbon detectors; \n(2) Heat, smoke, and flame detectors; \n(3) Gas and toxic detectors for control rooms and the laboratory; and \n(4) H2S detectors for the sulfur unit and the API area. \n\nRelease Containment and Control \n\n(1) Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases; \n(2) Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated); \n(3) Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature) \n(4) Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., a dump tank); \n(5) Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases; \n(6) Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system backup firewater pump); and \n(7) Atmospheric relief devices. \n\nRelease Mitigation \n\n(1) Fire suppression and extinguishing systems; \n(2) Deluge system for specific equipment; \n(3) Trained emergency response personnel; \n(4) Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus; and \n(5) Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel. \n\n6.0 EM"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. The Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Refinery is coordinated with local emergency responders, such as the fire department and the office of the Alaska State Troopers, as well as state and federal agencies. The Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of facilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if necessary.
