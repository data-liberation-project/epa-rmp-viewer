      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility:\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI) relies on numerous programs to ensure early identification of and proper response to potential emergencies, including: \n\n     Training and drills in emergency preparedness, disaster response and control, first-     aid, and fire and rescue techniques; \n\n     Frequent auditing of all preparedness programs, safety training and education; and\n\n     Regular review, follow-up, and maintenance of all company operations and equipment.  \n\nOur facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, participate in joint emergency drills, and gain familiarity with our operations.  Employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAPCI facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.
