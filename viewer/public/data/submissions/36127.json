Describe the accident release prevention and emergency policies\n\nIt is the intent of Dreyers ice cream Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment. Dreyers Ice Cream Company will also comply with all federal, state, and local laws. The plant manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key components in the plant safety and health program. Dreyers Ice cream Company exercises many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, Emergency Air Washing systems, ammonia spill holding containment system a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, Training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to upsets in the system.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n \n\n\nB.    Stationary source and regulated substances Handled\n\nDreyers Ice Cream Company Bakersfield Plant produces ice-cream products for sale to the public. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to freeze ice-cream products and also to operate the plant air-conditioning.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in in the Bakersfield plant, in reference to RMP submittal.\n\n\nC.    Description of the Accidental Release Prevention program \n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies wi"

Five Year Accident History\n\nTheir was NO ammonia-related incident identified for the Dreyers Bakersfield Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site consequences or off-site consequences. \n\n\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency response program is in place at the Dreyers Bakersfield Plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe Emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n1) Fire Plan\n2) Ammonia Leak Procedures\n3) Evacuation Procedures\n4) Responsibilities of the Emergency Response team\n    **The above Program has been coordinated with the Bakersfield fire Department.\n\n\nF.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety to the ammonia refrigeration system\n\nWater/Static ammonia absorption system for Safety relief Valves (SRV) will be added to the system. This is used to dump ammonia into a water absorption tank if there was a release From a SRV, Basically No Srv?s at this plant relieves to the Atmosphere now are in the future.\n\nThe existing ammonia refrigeration system will be equipped with the piping and valves to allow the current Siamese valve vessel dump system to dump into a future static ammonia absorption system. \n\nThe future production room will have the capability to utilize the current engine room emerg"
