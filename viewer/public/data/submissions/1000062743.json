In addition, it assists in collection of complete and accurate documentation associated with injury and illness incidents.  The Global EHS Event Management System Standard ensures that significant Environmental, Health, & Safety incidents are appropriately resolved and learning's from these incidents are communicated to prevent the reoccurrence at any site. This program requires immediate investigation and initial notification to management within 24 hours of a serious incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nAll Intel sites have a formal Emergency Management Plan, which includes the formation of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Incident Command Center (ICC), and Emergency Response Team (ERT). ERT members act as first responders to provide immediate assessment, assistance and event mitigation.  ERT coordinates with the EOC and has direct interface with outside agency responders (fire dept). ERT Members receive extensive training before they participate in the ERT. This includes a five day foundation course covering emergency response procedures, radio use, first aid/CPR, use of breathing apparatus, fire safety, chemical spill cleanup, and gas leak detection.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nAn internal compliance focused self-assessment audit of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program is conducted by site at a minimum of every three years.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Risk Management Plan\r\n\r\nIntel has a comprehensive Environmental, Health, and Safety Program that addresses all aspects of the life cycle of its processes, facilities, and products.  Its Process Safety/Risk Management program described here addresses how Intel manages the risks associated with high hazard chemical processes to prevent accidental releases, fires, or injuries related to process upsets with high or catastrophic potential.  Intel's advanced processes are consuming higher volumes of some hazardous gases than previous process technologies.  To accommodate this increased demand without increasing exposure risk, Intel has implemented an industry standard offering of DOT ISO module/trailer and ISOtainer/trailers to provide the process gas delivery and replace smaller industry standard cylinders.  Doing this will increase the volume of the gas delivery package, but it will also reduce projected package change frequency at advanced process factories, in some cases by 25X.  It is well known in the gas industry that the package change represents the highest risk for a release potential.   Intel has conducted numerous hazard assessments in conjunction with the ISO module and ISOtainer suppliers and our Architectural and Engineering (A&E) consultant. This included conducting numerous HazOp studies, consequence analysis on numerous scenarios, and a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in order to determine the risk management and control strategies.  The following describes the comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program elements for all of these high hazard chemical systems.\r\n\r\nSafety in Facilities and Equipment Design\r\n\r\nToday's semiconductor facilities utilize toxic, corrosive, pyrophoric, and flammable materials. These materials are inherently hazardous, sometimes in small quantities, and therefore safety engineering is required to contain the hazard, reducing the risk to meet acceptable risk levels.

EHS requirements such as SEMI S2 (safety), SEMI S8 (ergonomics), and S10 (hazard classification) are part of the S series of SEMI guidelines intended to define these industry safety standards for process equipment. In addition, Intel-specific requirements are included to address other risks. These include combustible material restrictions to reduce fire risk and environmental characterization and emissions requirements to control and manage our site environmental permitting requirements for air, waste, and water emissions.\r\n\r\nAfter the procurement of process equipment, it must be installed and integrated into facility systems. To accomplish this, EHS has integrated its requirements into the process equipment installation standards. This includes ergonomic clearances for safe maintenance and operation, ventilation, spill control, gas detection, and all EHS aspects related to how the process equipment is  installed. After these requirements have been established for equipment installations at the Technology Development site, they are transferred via the Master Design Package, which documents how all process equipment is installed at high volume manufacturing sites.\r\n\r\nSemiconductor process equipment is supported by larger facilities systems that perform gas distribution, bulk chemical delivery, and waste treatment.
