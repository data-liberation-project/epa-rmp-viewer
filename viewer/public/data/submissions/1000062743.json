Its Process Safety/Risk Management program described here addresses how Intel manages the risks associated with high hazard chemical processes to prevent accidental releases, fires, or injuries related to process upsets with high or catastrophic potential.  Intel's advanced processes are consuming higher volumes of some hazardous gases than previous process technologies.  To accommodate this increased demand without increasing exposure risk, Intel has implemented an industry standard offering of DOT ISO module/trailer and ISOtainer/trailers to provide the process gas delivery and replace smaller industry standard cylinders.  Doing this will increase the volume of the gas delivery package, but it will also reduce projected package change frequency at advanced process factories, in some cases by 25X.  It is well known in the gas industry that the package change represents the highest risk for a release potential.   Intel has conducted numerous hazard assessments in conjunction with the ISO module and ISOtainer suppliers and our Architectural and Engineering (A&E) consultant. This included conducting numerous HazOp studies, consequence analysis on numerous scenarios, and a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in order to determine the risk management and control strategies.  The following describes the comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program elements for all of these high hazard chemical systems.\n\n\n\nSafety in Facilities and Equipment Design\n\n\n\nToday's semiconductor facilities utilize toxic, corrosive, pyrophoric, and flammable materials. These materials are inherently hazardous, sometimes in small quantities, and therefore safety engineering is required to contain the hazard, reducing the risk to meet acceptable risk levels.

EHS requirements such as SEMI S2 (safety), SEMI S8 (ergonomics), and S10 (hazard classification) are part of the \"S\" series of SEMI guidelines intended to define these industry safety standards for process equipment. In addition, Intel-specific requirements are included to address other risks. These include combustible material restrictions to reduce fire risk and environmental characterization and emissions requirements to control and manage our site environmental permitting requirements for air, waste, and water emissions.\n\n\n\nAfter the procurement of process equipment, it must be installed and integrated into facility systems. To accomplish this, EHS has integrated its requirements into the process equipment installation standards. This includes ergonomic clearances for safe maintenance and operation, ventilation, spill control, gas detection, and all EHS aspects related to how the process equipment is  installed. After these requirements have been established for equipment installations at the Technology Development site, they are transferred via the Master Design Package, which documents how all process equipment is installed at high volume manufacturing sites.\n\n\n\nSemiconductor process equipment is supported by larger facilities systems that perform gas distribution, bulk chemical delivery, and waste treatment. EHS requirements are integrated into the design of this equipment through the Intel EHS Facilities Equipment Procurement Process, which is an Intel master specification for all newly pr"

EHS has integrated its requirements through the EHS Master Design Standard (MDS). The EHS MDS defines the requirements and expectations for the fabrication facilities.  This standard is used to support all applicable codes, standards, and regulations that drive the design of our facilities. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nAll new facilities systems utilizing high hazard chemicals have a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the adequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. This process is a 3 step approach:\n\n1.  An initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) is required on all new chemical facilities systems regardless of the  and applicability to OSHA PSM or EPA RMP.  One or more of the following methodologies are utilized to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n- What-If Checklist\n\n- Hazard Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)\n\n- Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA)\n\n- Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)\n\n2.   Conduct consequence analysis (dispersion modeling) of credible release scenarios identified in the PHA.  The goal is to have adequate safeguards in place to prevent an impact to the local community.\n\n3.  After the PHA is conducted, a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is conducted on all severe/catastrophic scenarios (including any potential off-site impacts) to ensure that the controls are sufficient to meet the internal Corporate Risk Tolerance Criteria.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review \n\n\n\nAfter the integration of EHS requirements into the procurement, design"
