      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Tempe Distribution Center are committed to operating the Distribution Center with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Distribution Center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Distribution Center personnel, and the environment, the Distribution Center has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Distribution Center's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and emergency response to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at the Tempe Distribution Center\n\nThe Tempe Distribution Center operates several refrigerated warehouses and freezers.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the Tempe Distribution Center.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages:  Liquid storage; Expansion; Evaporation; Compression; and Condensation.  The Tempe Milk Plant is served by the same ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a physical process, rather than a chemical process:  the ammonia undergoes no chemical changes in the refrigeration cycle.  Heat is removed from the product being refrigerated or frozen as ammonia changes phase from liquid to vapor.  By reliquefying the ammonia vapor, the ammonia can be used continuously in the refrigeration cycle.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Tempe Distribution Center which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure,"

Ammonia is the third highest-volume chemical produced in the United States.  The chemical formula of ammonia is NH3.  Anhydrous ammonia is handled both as a pressurized liquid at ambient temperature and as a refrigerated liquid at or below ambient pressure within the Tempe Distribution Center refrigeration system.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Distribution Center's accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements:  Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; Compliance Audits; and Employee Participation.  The purpose and scope of each element is briefly described below.\n\nProcess Safety Information - The purpose of compiling the required Process Safety Information is to enable Distribution Center personnel who work with the ammonia refrigeration system to identify and understand the hazards posed by ammonia refrigeration.
