This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nQEP's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  QEP's Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility has coordinated with the Evanston City Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility is located approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Evanston, Wyoming.\n\n\n\nThe Clear Creek storage facility is an underground storage facility that is capable of injecting 34 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day) into the underground storage and has the capability to withdraw 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day).\n\n\n\nThe station is designed to take gas delivery from a pipeline and simultaneously inject a portion of the gas to storage through two injection/withdrawal wells, and route the remaining volume to another pipeline.  Depending on the pressure of the delivering pipeline, redelivery to another pipeline may or may not require compression.  Actual gas delivery and routing volume capacities depends on pipeline pressures and is limited by compression, if required, and connected pipeline capacities.\n\n\n\nA 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/day) JT plant provides dewpoint control during gas withdrawal operations.  Liquids are stabilized in a stabilizer tower and the lighter hydrocarbon vapors from the top of the stabilizer tower (overhead gases) "

      "SummaryText": "are compressed in an overhead compressor and flow back to the inlet or residue of the plant as a recycle stream. NGL's from the bottom of the stabilizer are sent to a pressurized NGL storage vessel for sale by truck. \n\n \n\nThese substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  QEP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.4 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant's distance from any public receptors.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nThere have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nThe Clear Creek Gas Storage Central Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nQEP employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
