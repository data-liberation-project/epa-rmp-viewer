This commitment is demonstrated by an accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design of new systems, installation of equipment, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the refinery.  It is the company policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent the foreseeable releases of regulated chemicals.  However, in the event that an accidental release occurs, an emergency response plan that designates the roles of individuals has been established to mitigate the impact of the release within practical limits.  \n\n\n\n2.0  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Lion Oil Company refinery in El Dorado processes sour crude oil at a production rate of approximately 75,000 barrels per day (42 gal/bbl).  The petroleum products include gasoline, diesel, asphalt, coatings, and small quantities of other intermediate products.  The refinery operation produces or uses several regulated substances including propane, butane, hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide, and chlorine.  Flammable mixtures make up the majority of these regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.1  Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\n\n\nFor program level 3 processes such as those at Lion Oil Company, one worst case flammable release scenario was reported in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) which represents the greatest distance to endpoint for the flammable hazard class.  One alternate case scenario was also reported for the flammable hazard class.\n\n  \n\nSeveral release scenarios were evaluated in order to identify appropriate worst and alternate case flammable scenarios.  Of the scenarios evaluated, a catastrophic failure of Tank 536 was identified as the worst case flammable release s"

This release could potentially include approximately 3.5 million pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture resulting in a vapor cloud explosion causing off-site consequences including an overpressure of greater than 1 psi.  The alternate case flammable release is a failure of the Tank 185 resulting in the release of approximately 300,000 pounds of flammable hydrocarbon mixture; this scenario was selected in accordance with 40 CFR 68.28(b)(1) because it is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and it results in an offsite impact.  Such a release could result in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) and a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) resulting in off-site consequences of an overpressure greater than 1 psi and thermal radiation exposure greater than 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds respectively.  Employee training, PPE, and both fixed and mobile fire suppression equipment are in place to mitigate the results of these releases.  \n\nIt should be noted that the worst case and alternate case flammable release scenarios presented in this hazard assessment are based on very conservative situations which are unlikely to occur.  A detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) explosion consequence study of the refinery was completed by ABS Consulting in January of 2009.  This CFD study evaluated a number of potential explosion scenarios within the process units at the refinery based on detailed, site-specific information.  None of the detailed scenarios considered in this study were predicted to result in an off-site overpressure of greater than 1 psi.     \n\n\n\n3.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Lion Oil Company refinery is regulated by the EPA RMP regulations as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.

      "SummaryText": " Company (Lion) has developed the Process Safety Information (PSI) program with the participation and input of our employees from management, supervisory, hourly, and technical positions at the El Dorado refinery.  This program requires that all Lion employees contribute to the collection and retention of PSI that is covered under OSHA's PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 (d) (1-3) and EPA's RMP Standard, 40 CFR 68.65 (a-d).  Several process units at Lion contain a sufficient amount of highly hazardous chemicals to be covered by the OSHA PSM Standard and the EPA RMP Standard.  Lion recognizes the value of the good engineering and management principles promoted by these regulations and has chosen to apply some elements of the PSI Program to units and areas of the refinery that are not covered by the PSM/RMP regulations.  \n\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM Program and to a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The information addressed by this program is an essential resource for conducting PHA's; employee training, contractor safety, mechanical integrity, procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change (MOC), emergency preparedness, and insurance and compliance audits.  Access to PSI information is provided to all employees through Lion's computerized document control system as well as a request through the PSM Department or any refinery management staff.  \n\nPSI information and documents are required for all regulatory covered process units and all capital projects for major overhauls of existing process units or installation of a new process unit.  It is important to recognize that information is generated throughout the life cycle of a process unit and as such, PSI information is often updated through the MOC or PHA revalidation procedures.
