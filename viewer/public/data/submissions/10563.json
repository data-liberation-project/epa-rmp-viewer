              "Description": "The prevention program pertains to all chemicals.  There is only one process which is affected - storage.  The process involved two units.  One is storage and the second one is transfer of the material to a tanker (for toxics) or to a flare (for flammables).  The storage unit measures are:  all toxic storage tanks are located inside a secondary containment (diked) wall.  The volume of the containment is more than sufficient to contain all the contents of the storage tank.  The storage of flammables are inside pressurized tanks (in barges).  The pressure is relieved by routing the flammables to the flare for incineration.  Unit 2 is transfer operations.  During transfer spills can occur due to hose failure.  To prevent excess spills to the ground, there are shut off valves on the tanker to which the toxics are transferred to.  For transfer of flammables to the flare, the shut off is achieved by a shut down valve in the tank containing the flammables.",

These chemicals are stored in tanks with secondary containment and the tanks are equipped with relief valves in case of rupture.  To prevent overflow, the tank volume is noted daily and the volume to be added is carefully estimated and if the volume is more than 70%, the contents are then added in small increments.   During transfer operations to tanker trucks, the transfer is carefully monitored during the entire duration by atleast one facility person and if there is a spill, the transfer is discontinued immediately by the closing the valves which are installed on the tanker trucks and in the individual tanks.\n\nThe substances under Table 3, 68.130 are Butadiene, Butane, Butene, Propane and Propylene.  These are normally contained in the tank barges which dock at the shipyard for degassing.  The storage of the flammables are temporary but often the flammables can stay in the tank barges for 1 or 2 days.  The tank barges are always under pressure.  The degassing is conducted by routing the gases through a flare.   During the depressurization procedure, the substances are sent from the tank barges to the flare for incineration.   There are alarms and relief valves on the tank barges if there is a leak or if there any other hazards.  There are also valves on the tank barges to shut down the flow of the flammables to the flare if there is leak.  The transfer operation (from tank barge to flare) is carefully monitored by atleast one facility person."
