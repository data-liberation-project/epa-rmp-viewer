      "SummaryText": "This Anhydrous Ammonia Storage facility located two miles west of Central City, Nebraska along Hwy 30.  It's purpose is to provide Anhydrous Ammonia to a portable reactor for the purpose of manufacturing liquid nitrogen fertilizer.  The actual equipment used in the reaction process and the service performed to complete that conversion is done by outside contractors hired by Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company.  The Anhydrous Ammonia storage facilities at this location consist of one (1) 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel and one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel.  These two vessels have an operational limit of 85% capacity.  Also, occasionally on this facility there may be one rail car containing up to 40,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  The accidental release prevention program for anhydrous ammonia consists of carefully prepared, trained, and executed operations, maintenance and inspecition procedures including procedures for coordination of operations with outside contractors.  Additionally, the plant has been evaluated to consider sources of possiible accidental or intentional damage and measuires have been taken to mitigate such damage.  Aurora Cooperative has considered the potential impact of a worst-case release scenario (which as defined by EPA is the total contents release of the largest storage vessel in a 10 minute period) and also a more likely release scenario.  Aurora Cooperative's emergency response plan includes training of operations personnel in both operations and emergency procedures as well as training select employees in the use of specialized response techniques and equipment.  Emergency response is coordinated with local emergency responders including the Central City Fire department.  This plant was placed in service for the first time in November of 2003 and has no history of accidental releases.  Based upon the most recent hazard review, planned improvements for this facility include the enhancement of protective barriers a"
