During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.2.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nThe ammonia process at the Community Renewable Energy Services facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n1.3    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.4    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nCommunity Renewable Energy Services' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our ev"
