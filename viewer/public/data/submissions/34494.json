      "SummaryText": "KIK Georgia (KIK) produces household cleaning products and product bottles at its Hampton Georgia facility.  Its principal product is household bleach.  This Risk Management Plan is submitted for the chlorine that is stored and used at the facility for the production of household bleach (sodium hypochlorite).\n\nChlorine is received at the plant in 90 ton tank cars.  These tank cars are hooked up to the hypochlorite process directly and serve as the storage for chlorine used in the process.  The siding used for the chlorine tank car storage abuts the hypochlorite processing area, so that all pipe lengths for the chlorine process are relatively short.  An operator is on-hand at all times while chlorine is being used by the process, so response times to any release are within minutes.\n\nKIK Georgia operates using a Process Safety Management Program for chlorine in accordance with OSHA 1910.119.  As such, the facility maintains training and maintenance programs to provide the maximum in release prevention for this operation.  The hypochlorite production process also uses a hypochlorite batch controller with alarm horns and an emergency shutoff of chlorine flows to prevent over chlorination of a hypochlorite batch.  This controller incorporates a redundant measuring system to ensure that the chlorination operation is well-monitored and controlled.\n\nKIK Georgia has not experienced any accidents with significant on or off-site consequences in the last five years.\n\nKIK Georgia has a written Emergency Response Plan for on-site response to chlorine releases.  This plan has been coordinated with the Henry County Fire Department.  Elements of the plan include procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine release for on-site response, first aid, public notification and evacuation, coordination with the Fire Department, and reporting to the Environmental Protection Division.  \n\nThe KIK Georgia facility is committed to the protection of the health and safety of its employees, the "
