We will at a minimum: \n\n\n\n1.    Participate in the development and implementation of the site specific Process Safety \n\nManagement (PSM) and RMP Programs\n\n\n\n2.    Participate in conducting the chlorine and ammonia process  hazard analysis\n\n\n\n3.    Conduct annual training on the PSM and RMP programs and make employees aware of \n\nany interim changes to the program or process systems\n\n\n\n4.    Work with our management and safety to develop additional programs or procedures \n\nrelative to chlorine processes and ammonia process safety\n\n\n\n5.    Participate in periodic audits of the chemical processes and the PSM Program.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the \n\npotential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and \n\nrevised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide \n\nimmediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\n\n\nThe Draper Water Treatment Plant is a non-responding facility at this time (June 21, 2004) in the \n\nevent of an emergency; however, in the event of a release, DWTP personnel will provide \"first \n\nresponse\" only for the shutting down of affected systems.
