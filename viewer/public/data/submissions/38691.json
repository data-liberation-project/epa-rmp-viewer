      "SummaryText": "personnel during emergencies\n\n* outline emergency response actions\n\n* provide check lists to assist with emergency management effectiveness\n\n\n\nThe facility emergency alarm system consists of paging horns, fire alarms, and high and low gas detection alarms.  All alarms are audible and are either automatically activated or can be manually activated.  To manually activate the alarms you must depress the red \"Alarm Activation\" button for two seconds on the fire alarm panel.  An \"all clear\" announcement will be made once any danger has passed.\n\n\n\nThe first priority following any incident must be the health and safety of all persons involved. The response will depend on the incident and the resources readily available, and may include the administration of first aid, fire suppression, evacuation, shutting off equipment and/or notifying the ambulance police or fire departments.  Once the situation is secured, additional assistance may be sought as required and notification procedures must be initiated.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP management process, continual training is provided to company employees directly affected by the RMP rule.  The installation of permanent hard piping will be done in 2002 negating the use of flexible process lines currently in use with some RMP chemicals.  Best management and industrial practices will continue to drive safety for handling all chemicals at CR&L.\n\n"
