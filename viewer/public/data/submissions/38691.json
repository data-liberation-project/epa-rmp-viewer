The product we create is technology.  This technology is related to refining processes that use catalysts to speed up production using less equipment.  Our SIC Code is 8731 (NAICS Code is 54171). \r\n\r\nWe have three (3) EPA RMP listed chemicals on site: 1,3-Butadiene, 1-Butene, and Isobutane.  These chemicals are stored in LPG rated tanks and tankers in quantities not greater than 40,000 pounds.  Our worst-case release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion which has an off-site 1 pound over pressure impact of up to .3 miles or 1746 feet from the center of the event.  Calculations for making this determination are taken from EPA's RMP Comp. software.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\n* Vapor cloud explosion\r\n* Instantaneous failure of inner and outer tank walls simultaneously\r\n* Failure of all active safety systems\r\n* Worst-case weather conditions: stable, low wind speed\r\n* Total release- entire vessel contents of 40,000 in 10 minutes\r\n* Area impacted .3 miles (1,746 feet)\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario:\r\n* Vapor Cloud Explosion\r\n* Failure of a 2 loading hose\r\n* Active and passive safety systems working\r\n* Emergency shutdown system isolates release\r\n* Most common weather conditions\r\n* Release rate 31 pounds per minute\r\n* Total release time 15 minutes\r\n* Area impacted .10 miles (582 feet)\r\n\r\nAccident Prevention Measures:\r\n* Storage vessels are high-pressure construction, pressure relieves to flare\r\n* High flow shutoff valve on LPG trailer\r\n* Emergency equipment shutdown procedures\r\n* Remote valves to isolate and limit release\r\n* Water fog for releases\r\n* Regulatory guidelines for safe operation (OSHA Process safety and EPA RMP)\r\n* Risk management\r\n* Mechanical"

      "SummaryText": "personnel during emergencies\r\n* outline emergency response actions\r\n* provide check lists to assist with emergency management effectiveness\r\n\r\nThe facility emergency alarm system consists of paging horns, fire alarms, and high and low gas detection alarms.  All alarms are audible and are either automatically activated or can be manually activated.  To manually activate the alarms you must depress the red Alarm Activation button for two seconds on the fire alarm panel.  An all clear announcement will be made once any danger has passed.\r\n\r\nThe first priority following any incident must be the health and safety of all persons involved. The response will depend on the incident and the resources readily available, and may include the administration of first aid, fire suppression, evacuation, shutting off equipment and/or notifying the ambulance police or fire departments.  Once the situation is secured, additional assistance may be sought as required and notification procedures must be initiated.\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMP management process, continual training is provided to company employees directly affected by the RMP rule.  The installation of permanent hard piping will be done in 2002 negating the use of flexible process lines currently in use with some RMP chemicals.  Best management and industrial practices will continue to drive safety for handling all chemicals at CR&L."
