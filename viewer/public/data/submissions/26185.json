      "SummaryText": "Chevron Phillips Cedar Bayou facility is a subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, headquartered in Houston, Texas.  The Cedar Bayou Plant is located on the North side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander, and is situated on approximately 1000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963. In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger, and is currently part of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, as the result of a joint venture.\n\nThe basic business of Cedar Bayou is to produce simple olefins, mostly ethylene and propylene, and derivatives which include polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily intermediates which are processed further by our customers to produce finished consumer products.  End uses for our products include: plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubes and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  We also convert by-product acetylene into acetylene black which is used in battery and magnetic tape production.\n\nELABORATION ON ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nThe Cedar Bayou plant complies with the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care initiative.\n\nThe processes at Cedar Bayou comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This standard is intended only for the management of highly hazardous chemicals.  However, Cedar Bayou has applied its programs and policies to the entire plant, regardless of the degree of hazard.  Specific programs include:  \n(1)    A detailed hazard assessment conducted on all processes to ensure they have been designed safely,\n(2)    An intensive equipment inspection program to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases,\n(3)    A work permit system to ensure that all work on process equipment is conducted in a safe manner,\n(4)    A Management of Change system to ensure that any change is thoroughly reviewed prior to being implemented,\n(5)    A train"

First aid measures are: wash skin with soapy water, and seek medical attention for all but minor exposure.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF ADDITIONAL TOXIC ALTERNATIVE (worst case) RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nCHEMICAL:  Ammonia, Aqueous>20%\nASSUMPTIONS:  (1) Worst case scenario used to prove no off-site consequences, (2) Instantaneous failure of vessel, (3) Failure of al active safety systems, (4) Worst-case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed), (5) Total release - entire contents of vessel (150,000 lbs.) released into a containment basin.  Vapor cloud based on evaporation rate from liquid pool.  Utilized EPA Guidance for wastewater treatment plants.\nPredicted impact will not reach off-site.\nACCIDENT PREVENTION EXAMPLE BESIDES THOSE PREVIOUSLY ELABORATED ON:  (1) Containment basin is designed for full volume release, (2) A water scrubber is located on the tank vent and is used during the unloading process to minimize air emiss"

This voluntary program is a partnership between OSHA and industry to recognize and encourage excellence and continuous improvement in safety programs.  STAR certification represents the highest form of recognition OSHA can give a company for outstanding safety performance.\n\nELABORATION ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nALARM SYSTEMS:  Cedar Bayou has an internal plant wide alarm system for fires and emergencies.  In addition, the Baytown alarm system can be activated in the event of incidents with potential offsite consequences.\nTRAINED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS:  To protect our people and property, Cedar Bayou has fully trained responders consisting of volunteer employees covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hr coverage. Each shift has a Fire & Safety Specialist, 10 Fire Brigade members, and 3 Emergency Medical Service / Rescue members.  ERT members receive training in all recognized categories of response (Fire, Haz-Mat, Emergency Medical Treatment, Rescue, and Environmental Protection).  One recent accomplishment of our ERT was their winning their fourth consecuative championship title in the International Rescue & Emergency Care Association (IRECA) competition.\nCOMMUNICATIONS LINK TO OFFSITE RESPONDERS:\nThe Cedar Bayou Emergency Command Center (ECC) is our link for internal and external responders. The ECC is staffed by Environmental, Health & Safety personnel, as well as individuals who are on-call.  City of Baytown emergency assistance would be through 911. Industry assistance would be through mutual aid groups listed below.  Our Safety Supervisor participates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In 1988, we shared release scenario information wi"

There have been no incidents at the facility that meet the EPA RMP reporting requirements with respect to on-site damage or injury.\n\n1/23/98 - A polyethylene reactor experienced a runaway reaction. A safety system activated as designed to prevent the escalation of the release scenario, releasing the small volume of ethylene (2,000 lbs.) at high pressure (25,000 psig) to the atmosphere.  This small vapor cloud ignited and carbon fallout landed off-site.  This resulted in vehicle clean-up costs of $40 for a neighbor.\n3/31/2000 - A polyethylene reactor experienced a runaway reaction. A safety system activated as designed to prevent the escalation of the release scenario, releasing the small volume of ethylene (1,000 lbs.) at high pressure  to the atmosphere.  The rumble from the release allegedly caused a glass in a neighbors front door to crack.  This resulted in a repair fee of $100. \nBORON TRIFLOURIDE, TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE, AQUEOUS AMMONIA:  There have been no releases of Boron Triflouride, Titanium Tetrachloride, or Aqueous Ammonia at the Cedar Bayou plant in the past five years that have had an adverse impact on the community or that meets the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements with respect to on-site injuries or damage.\n3/1/2002 - Rupture discs are safety systems used to release abnormal pressures quickly in processes that operate at very high pressures.  On 3/1/2002, a rupture disc in a polyethylene process became fatigued to 70% tolerance of the intended set pressure.  It perforated below the intended set pressure and released approximately 4,700 lbs of polyethylene flake, containing mostly ethylene, to the atmosphere and the area adjacent to the unit.   This necessitated a cleanup, mostly for aesthetic purposes.  Vacuum trucks were used for the cleanup, and one neighbor's driveway was allegedly cracked from the weight of one truck.
