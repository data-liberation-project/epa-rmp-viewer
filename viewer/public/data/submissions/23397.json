This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CHATTANOOGA FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Hydrofluoric Acid.  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers.  The Sulfur Dioxide and Hydrofluoric Acid  are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and Hydrofluoric Acid are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,664,900 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Hydrofluoric Acid are present at our facility in quantities of 58,700 lbs., and 7,670 lbs.,  respectively.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in t"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 180,000 pound railcar of chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class D atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a Ton CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are \n taken into account to calculate the scenario.  With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a TON SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 1.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydroflouric Acid involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3262 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     WHAT IF  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated"
