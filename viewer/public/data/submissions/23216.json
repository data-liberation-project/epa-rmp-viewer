OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN THE PROPER LOADING AND UNLOADING OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AS WELL AS SPECIFICALLY THE SAFE HANDELING OF CHLORINE GAS.THIS IS DONE BY HANDS-ON TRAINING AS WELL AS FILMS ON THE SAFE HANDLEING OF CHLORINE AND OTHER HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. SINCE CHLORINE ALSO REACTS WITH OTHER CHEMICALS WE MAKE SURE THAT IT IS STORED SEPERATELY FROM OTHER CHEMICALS AT ALL TIMES. BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SINCE THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 1972 WE HAVE HAD NO CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE  SCENARIO FOR A ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AT OUR FACILITY WOULD BE THE RUPTURE OF A 150# CHLORINE GAS CYLINDER IN WHICH ALL 150 POUNDS WOULD BE RELEASED. USING THE RMP COMP. METHOD THIS WOULD EFFECT A .3 MILE RADIUS OF OUR FACILITY. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR WE WOULD CONTACT OUR LOCAL HAZMAT TEAM AND BEGIN THE NECESSARY EVACUATIONS. THIS SCENATIO IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE CYLINDERS ARE HYDROSTATIC TESTED REGULARLY AND ARE VISUALLY INSPECTED EVERY TIME THEY ARE FILLED. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE CYLINER ANY LEAK THAT OCCURS STARTS AS A SMALL LEAK AND DUE TO THE STRONG ODOR IS EASILY DETECTED. IN THE EVENT OF A SMALL LEAK WE HAVE ONSITE A RECOVERY VESSEL(COFFIN) TO PUT ANY LEAKING CYLINDER IN TO CONTROL THE LEAK. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN THE PROPER USE OF THE RECOVERY VESSEL."
