The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  \n\nThe City of Edinburg Declorination Injection Station is located at 516 So. Raul Longoria, in Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The dechlorination building at the injection station consists of a three walled canopy structure facing west.  Six 1-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide are stored at the facility.  Only two 1-ton containers are connected to the system at one time.  These are located inside the walled canopy structure.  One 1-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup.  The sulfur dioxide containers have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency and a alarm will be triggered if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is unmanned however, operators check the dechlorination station twice per shift.  Self-Contained- Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) is stored in the control room.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Dechlorination Injection Station includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (sulfur dioxide): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion m"
