The facility is a batch chemical production plant that produces amphoteric surfactants, esters, and solutions for the agrochemical market.\r\n  \r\nThe following information is intended to satisfy the requirements under 40 CFR \u00a768.155 regarding the Executive Summary of a United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  In this facility, Oxiteno handles Ethylene oxide (CAS 75-21-8), Sulfur dioxide (CAS 7446-09-5), and Propylene oxide (CAS 75-56-9). Ethylene oxide and Propylene oxide are handled in volumes that exceed the threshold quantity as prescribed under Table 1 of 40 CFR \u00a768.130.  Sulfur dioxide is also handled at the facility but does not exceed the threshold quantity, however, it is included in the RMP voluntarily by Oxiteno.  Additionally, these processes are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is under Code 325199 of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the Program 3 Prevention Program is applicable.\r\n\r\n1.1\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nEthylene oxide (EtO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), and Propylene oxide (PO) are used as part of various processes at the facility.  The substances are stored in and unloaded from railcars, stored in tanks, and used in site reactors.  The same properties that makes EtO, SO2, and PO valuable to Oxiteno's production process also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the substance to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and welfare as well as those of its employees, and to reduce the threat to the nearby population.  It is Oxiteno's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which EtO, SO2, and PO is hand"

Those railcars are unloaded to the vessels indicated above and are listed below:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\t17 - 20,000-gallon pressurized railcars for EtO; and\r\n\u00bf\t2 - 20,000-gallon pressurized railcars for PO.\r\n\r\nEtO, SO2, and PO are piped under their own pressure to various locations throughout the facility.  Access to the storage tanks is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of the subject chemicals that can be stored at the site are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tEtO - 446,000 gallons;\r\n\u00bf\tSO2 - 8,000 gallons; and\r\n\u00bf\tPO  - 76,720 gallons.\r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
