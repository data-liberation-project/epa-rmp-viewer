      "SummaryText": "Grain Craft Ogden treats flours with chlorine gas to enhance performance in the production of certain baked products such as cakes, cookies and tortillas.  Subsequently, equipment and operational techniques have evolved that ensure the process is carried out with very little risk to employees and the public.  The mechanical systems in place are \"State of the art\" for the industry.  Systems are in place which include training of operators, continuous electronic monitoring devices, and routine inspection by operators. Grain Craft has relied on expert third-party inspection and maintenance for many years.  OSHA PSM standards have been implemented at the facility.  The process draws chlorine gas from one-ton cylinders by generating a vacuum.  In the event of a failure in any of the application equipment, the vacuum is lost and chlorine gas flow stops.  Electrical interlocking of application equipment ensures that unless all processes function properly, gas is not allowed to leave the manifold.  In addition, electronic sensors located in areas adjacent to the point of application and the storage room will sound an alarm and shut the system down should chlorine be detected in the atmosphere.\n \nThe maximum intended inventory of chlorine at this site is 20,000 pounds, which exceeds the EPA's threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Grain Craft is therefore subject to RMP requirements under CAA 112(r).\n\nThe process is designed and maintained in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety information that is incorporated within the Process Safety Management (PSM) document on file at the facility.  It is Grain Craft's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which the mill operates and maintains the chlorine storage and dispensing system.  Corbion Caravan, a nationally recognized expert firm, has performed all periodic and and preventative maintenance"

      "SummaryText": "over many years, and provided frequent and thorough training to mill personnel.  Safety and maintenance procedures outlined in the PSM Plan are followed, and will minimize the potential of a release of chlorine to the environment.\n  \nNo accidental releases have occurred in the past five years.   \n\nRelease prevention is provided by Program 3 as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Program 3 includes Process Safety Management (PSM) with the following elements:\n\n-Employee Participation\n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Contractors\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Hot Work Permit(s)\n-Management of Change\n-Incident Investigation\n-Compliance Audits\n-Emergency Response\n-Trade Secrets\n\nGrain Craft has an emergency action plan in place in the event of a chlorine release.  The facility's position regarding response is to defer to Weber County LEPC, as their personnel is appropriately trained and equipped to respond to a catastrophic release.  The Weber County LEPC's phone number is (801) 778-6682 or (801) 778-6609.  It is the facility's policy to respond to an emergency by calling 911.  The 911 dispatch will notify the fire department, which includes the HAZMAT team.  The fire departments' HAZMAT Team Leader will act as the site coordinator.  The fire department will coordinate with other public agencies and conduct public notification and evacuation as necessary.  The HAZMAT team is familiar with the Grain Craft facility's one-ton chlorine cylinders and ancillary mitigation devices.  Grain Craft will initially notify CHLOREP at (800) 424-9300 and EPA National Response Center at (800) 424-8802. Then, Grain Craft will follow up when the exact amount of the release is known.  \n     \nGrain Craft operates an internal program referred to as the Continuous Improvement Program.  This policy documents improvement objectives, investigates root causes, and implements corrective actions to prevent recurrences."
