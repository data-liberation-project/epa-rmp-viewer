Some of these precautions include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPreparing and implementing a Facility Response Plan (FRP);\r\n\u00bf\tComplying with NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code\r\n\u00bf\tAnnual inspections of the butane system by a qualified outside contractor;\r\n\u00bf\tPreparing and implementing a Spill, Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan;\r\n\u00bf\tInstituting safe operating procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining employees in safety programs and procedures; and\r\n\u00bf\tCoordinating with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\n3\tGeneral accidental release prevention program\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to making the change.  This facility has a strong commitment to the safe handling of butane and other flammable materials and to minimize the probability of an accidental release.  This is achieved through a combination of safety equipment, personnel training and operating procedures.  The safety equipment includes excess flow valves, pressure relief valves and emergency shut off valves.  The butane tank and supporting equipment was inspected, tested and refurbished in October, 2005 prior to initiating the butane process at this facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition, HWRT has contracted with an experienced, knowledgeable, outside contractor to perform annual inspections of the butane system.  This inspection includes evaluating the condition of the tank, piping, and supports, checking the internal valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut-off valves and cables, pressure gauge, and liquid pump. \r\n\r\n4\tFive-year accident history\r\n\r\nThis facility has not had a release of butane or other regulated substance as defined in 40 CFR 6"

The FRP includes information regarding emergency response, hazard identification, various discharge scenarios, descriptions of periodic drills and exercises and describes employee training.  The SPCC Plan includes similar information as well as facility inspection forms.  Employees are typically provided with emergency response training, on-the-job training, spill prevention and spill response training and other supplemental training.\r\n\r\nThe Facility Response Plan contains specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of butane, procedures to inform the public about a release, and first aid and toxicity information regarding butane.  All employees working with butane are trained in handling flammable materials and are provided with annual refresher training.  A copy of this plan has been sent to the White County LEPC.  The telephone number for the LEPC is 618-384-4701.\r\n\r\n6\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThe procedures are reviewed annually to look for safety improvements.  The most recent PHA (performed on September 14, 2015) identified a need to install barrier(s) to protect the butane unloading piping from a hit by a truck.  Facility plans to install such barrier(s) by December 1, 2015.\r\n\r\n7\tModel used to perform worst-case and alternate scenario\r\n\r\nFacility had used ARCHIE model in the past to calculate end-point distances for worst-case and alternate scenario.  40 CFR 68.25 (g) and 68.28 (c) require use of RMP off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance or any commercially or publicly available air dispersion modelling techniques.  ARCHIE model is no longer publicly available from EPA or FEMA.  Hence, for this renewal submission, EPA's RMP* Comp* software was used to derive the end-point distances.

      "SummaryText": "1\tThe HWRT Terminal - Norris City, LLC (HWRT) facility is a terminal for the storage and distribution of various fuels.  Petroleum products (i.e., gasoline and diesel) are received by pipeline.  Transport trucks deliver ethanol, biodiesel, and other additives to the facility.  Transport trucks deliver the products to the facility's customers.  HWRT has a 30,000 gallon butane storage tank and a butane injection process at the facility.  Butane has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a regulated substance subject to 40 CFR Part 68, which required the preparation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  HWRT is also subject to the OSHA process safety management standard and is submitting a program level 3 Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe initial construction of the terminal facility was completed in 1960, and it included construction of Tanks NC-01 through NC-04 for petroleum storage.  HWRT Terminal - Norris City, LLC purchased the terminal from Crown Central,LLC in 2004.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on Cherry Street, approximately 0.5 mile west of U.S. Highway 1 and 0.25 mile north of Main Street in Norris City.  The immediate vicinity is sparsely populated; however, the closest residence is across the street from the facility's exit gate.  The facility has fuel and additive storage tanks with capacities ranging from 300 to 2,524,116 gallons.  Each of these fuel tanks is provided with adequate secondary containment.  \r\n\r\nThe butane injection process is fairly simple.  Liquefied butane gas is delivered in tank trucks and pumped into the butane tank.  Butane is stored under ambient temperatures and under pressure.  Butane is injected into gasoline by pumping it into the pipeline as the gasoline is being delivered to an HWRT storage tank.  The butane injection into gasoline delivery pipeline can occur either from the butane storage tank or directly from the tank truck unloading butane.\r\n\r\n2\tIt is HWRT's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and lo"
