Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 miles.\r\n\r\nRMP Comp was used as a tool to calculate distance to endpoints of 1 psi over pressure. RMP Comp assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 C (77 F). TMT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent (10%).\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The total quantity of propane released was calculated as approximately 20 lbs.  The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limited the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.02 miles."

The facility has a Terminal Manager who is able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies as needed at the scene of the incident.

The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement, and medical organizations. \r\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultations with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. \r\nLarger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required.\r\nThe plans are reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain up-to-date, reflecting current activities on site and employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response should a situation arise. The EAP is based upon the following guidelines and standards:\r\n\r\n1.\tNPGA LP-Gas Safety Handbooks: Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and how to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires.\r\n2.\tOSHA's Occupational Safety and Health Standards for General Industry, specifically: 29 CFR 1910.38, Emergency Action Plans, 29 CFR 1910.39, Fire Prevention Plans, 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\r\n3.\tNational"
