The Risk Management Program rule requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics completed an update of the original RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMP*Submit.  A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n? Introduction;\n? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n? Hazard Assessment;\n? Prevention Program;\n? Five-Year Accident History;\n? Emergency Response Plan; and\n? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nSterigenics EO, Inc. operates a contract sterilization facility located Glens Falls.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics.  This RMP formalizes and documents these "

The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the facility. These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis).\n\nIFive-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n? The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n? The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nSterigenics EO - Glens Falls has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Sterigenics EO - Glens Falls are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning committee and the Queensbury Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Sterigenics EO - Glens Falls also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics' activities.

Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves.  Lower explosive limit (LEL) sensors are located near areas of potential leaks including gas storage areas, gas charging areas, and some of the chamber doors that will alarm with an audible alarm in the event of a major leak from the ethylene oxide cylinders or process."
