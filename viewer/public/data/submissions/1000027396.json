Compliance with EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68), Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) is also be maintained. This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system at Columbus Foods - 493 Forbes Boulevard, South San Francisco, California.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  Columbus Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the CalARP rules as a result of meeting other regulatory program requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the CalARP requirements, that information is contained in this document.  Note:  Columbus has rewritten and improved the company's CalARP/RMP/PSM programs.  All documentation prior to this effort is on-hand and available; all new programs/policies implemented as a result of this effort are initiated and are being utilized moving forward.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tCommitment to Safety\r\n\r\nColumbus Foods is committed to providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining Zero Accident Tolerance through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to"

The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the compressors (RC-1, RC-2, RC-3, RC-4, RC-5) to the plate and frame condensing heat exchangers (PHEC-1, PHEC-2) where heat is rejected (high stage discharge gas is introduced on one side of the plates and fluid cooler water is pumped through the other side), turning the ammonia vapor back into a high pressure liquid.  The high pressure liquid is then drained via gravity to the high pressure receiver (HPR) through the condenser drain lines where the cycle starts over again.\r\n\r\n1.3.4.\tAs a result of the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant at Columbus Foods, the facility has developed and implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program in accordance with CalARP 2760 and 40 CFR 68.  Also in place is a Process Safety Management program as required by Cal OSHA Title 8, Section 5189 and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.119. A Management System has been developed to oversee the regulatory programs at the Columbus Foods facility.   \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n1.4.\tWorst/Alternate Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\n1.4.1.\tAlthough engineering controls incorporated into the refrigeration process would normally prevent such releases, the possibility of a catastrophic release does exist.

Columbus is committed to implementing the recommendations from these activities as a way of always improving safety.  \r\n\r\n1.3.\tColumbus Foods Description\r\n\r\n1.3.1.\tColumbus Foods is located at 493 Forbes Boulevard, South San Francisco, California. The facility is a salame and deli meat processing facility that receives raw materials from suppliers. The raw product is processed on site to make final and work in process products for distribution to retailers or further packaging. \r\n\r\n1.3.2.\tAnhydrous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP, is utilized at Columbus Foods in the facility's ammonia refrigeration system. Approximately 3,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized for refrigeration in the ammonia process.  The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, condensers, compressors, heat exchangers, and miscellaneous refrigeration equipment located within the refrigeration system.  This is a single stage, minimal charge system.  This system has five reciprocating compressors, two plate and frame condensing heat exchangers, one high pressure receiver, two suction accumulators, and four plate and frame process heat exchangers. \r\n\r\n1.3.3.\tThe ammonia refrigeration system operates as a high stage system designed to cool glycol in the four plate and frame heat exchangers (chillers).  High pressure liquid (HPL) from the high pressure receiver (HPR) is supplied to suction accumulators SA-1 and SA-2.  At the suction accumulators (SA-1 and SA-2), liquid ammonia flows to the (4) plate and frame heat exchangers (PHE-1, PHE-2, PHE-3, PHE-4) where it removes heat from the glycol passing through the plates; and the suction from the heat exchangers returns to the suction accumulators (SA-1 and SA-2). Vapor from the suction accumulators is routed to the compressors through the high stage suction (HSS) and high high stage suction (HHSS) headers. During the compression"
