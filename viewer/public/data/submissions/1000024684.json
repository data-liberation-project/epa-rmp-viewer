Release scenarios are less likely to occur during the May through August timeframe due to process inactivity (non-blending season); however, releases greater than de minimus quantities are extremely unlikely, regardless.  The Worst Case distance to endpoint is based on a 1 psi overpressure from the explosion of a butane vapor cloud (see Appendix A, Figure A1).  The selected Alternate Case endpoint criteria is an energy value of 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds (expressed as a second degree burn) (see Appendix A, Figure A2).  All distances were modeled using the U.S. EPA's RMP Comp-Version 1.07.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case scenario assumes a catastrophic failure of the system single largest vessel (per EPA Guidance Document) resulting in a total release of the flammable substance (Butane) and the resulting vapor cloud explosion, both of which are highly unlikely.  In this case, one butane storage vessel was assumed to fail releasing approximately 246,697 pounds of butane.  A 10% yield (TNT equivalent) is assumed as a parameter of this model.  Incorporating a wind speed of 3.4 mph, an atmospheric stability class of F, and an air temperature of 77\u00b0F, a 1 psi overpressure distance to endpoint was determined to be 0.5 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Alternate scenario was determined based on a combination of the likelihood of an event and its potential severity (The U.S. EPA requires that the Alternate scenario impacts off-site receptors unless no alternative is available).  In this case, the BLEVE scenario was chosen which identifies the unlikely potential that this situation would arise.  The most likely situation that would lead to a BLEVE of a vessel"

The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this facility is approximately 248,935 pounds inclusive or piping.  Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 60,000-gallon (W.C.) storage vessel.  Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel).  The butane is pumped to a blending/injection skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the injection points to the gasoline truck-loading rack.  Injection quantities are controlled via the injection blending skid based on sampling data obtained through the Bartec-Benke Analyzer and typically range from 2-8%.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250\u00b0F) pneumatic valve line (or fusible links) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed [exception is pump bypass valve]), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal (also referred to as GUI or HMI), line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs (set points = 50 psi differential), and grounding interlock devices.  Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors/visitors.

The Charlotte East Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Charlotte, NC.  The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum-based additives.  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Butane Blending Process (source) at the Terminal/Facility.  This document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and includes by reference the attached Process Safety Management Program elements (Part I) in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  Enforcement of 40 CFR Part 68 is delegated to Mecklenburg County.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the Facility is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Charlotte East is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees (and contractors, as appropriate), which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Facility.\r\n\r\nThe Charlotte East Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Code (NFPA #58-2011) requirements for LP"
