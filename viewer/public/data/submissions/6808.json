The hydrogen storage and mixing facilities are leased from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.  Operation, maintenance of employee training for this storage facility are coordinated with Air Products.  Preparation of the Risk Management Plan for hydrogen storage has included a review and update of our existing Emergency Response Plan and Process Safety Management Plan.  There have been no accidential releases from hydrogen storage during the past five years.  The alternative release scenario for the hydrogen storage demonstrates that no one from the general public would be affected."
