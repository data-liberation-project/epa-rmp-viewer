Micron works vigorously to continuously improve in support of these commitments.\n\n\n\nMicron is committed to maintaining a safe, healthy, and secure workplace by working to prevent occupational illnesses, injuries, and property losses. Micron also strives to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment by working to identify opportunities to reduce air, water, land and energy impacts at the earliest stages of planning and production.\n\n\n\nMicron holds managers and supervisors responsible for leading, implementing and maintaining safe, secure, and compliant work areas. Management, employees, and contractors are expected to help identify, eliminate, and control environmental, health, safety, and security (EHSS) hazards and risks. All employees and contractors will follow relevant EHSS procedures and applicable legal requirements, including those contained in Micron's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (found at www.micron.com).\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED: \n\nThe covered process is a bulk chemical distribution system that supplies high purity White grade gaseous anhydrous ammonia through distribution piping to manufacturing and R&D equipment for metal organic chemical vapor deposition which is a basic step in LED manufacturing.\n\n\n\nContainers:\n\nThe system uses two 20 foot long ammonia International Organization for Standardization (ISO) containers (ISO container) that are owned, filled and maintained by Air Products and Chemicals, Inc (Air Products). The ISO containers are connected to the fixed distribution piping at the specially designed pad with a flexible pigtail.  Each ISO container has approximately 26,000 lbs of liquid anhydrous ammonia when completely full.  Although both ISO containers are connected to the piping system, only one supplies"

When the container reaches its low level, it is disconnected from the piping system and returned to Air Products in Hometown, Pennsylvania to be serviced and filled after being replaced with a full ISO container.\n\n\n\nThe ISO containers come equipped with electric heaters on the bottom of the ISO containers that are plugged in as part of an ISO container change to keep the anhydrous ammonia at a specified temperature to support delivery pressure.\n\n\n\nBulk Ammonia Pad:\n\nThe bulk ammonia pad is a specially designed structure that includes ISO container scales, flexible connections to distribution piping, electrical connections, purge gases, flow controllers, ventilation, safety shower and other safety and support equipment.  The structure at the pad provides safe worker access to the connections at the top of the ISO container and environmental cover for the ISO containers.\n\n\n\nDistribution System:\n\nGaseous ammonia is delivered from the ISO container through a 1 inch heat traced stainless steel pipe along a utility trestle to the building housing process tools. Once inside the building, the pipe goes through a manual distribution box and then a valve manifold box where it is split into eight ? inch pipes for distribution to the equipment after going through a purifier box.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nMicron utilizes the required PSM/RMP for the anhydrous ammonia regulated process to prevent and minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. The goal of the PSM is to protect on-site employees and the RMP protects the health and safety of the environment and the community. Components of the PSM/RMP document include:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nInformation pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects"

Detailed information concerning the technology and equipment of the process are included in the PSM/RMP documents.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nThe process hazard analysis has been conducted using a hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology. At least every five years the analysis will be updated and revalidated by a team with representation from appropriate groups. A preventative maintenance (PM) work order has been entered in Micron's asset management software (Maximo) to trigger this event.  The work order will dispatch to the safety team who will initiate this effort. All future findings will be promptly addressed with corrective action and completion dates recorded in the analysis.  All process hazard analyses, updates, revalidations, and corrective actions and resolutions will be kept for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nWritten operating procedures for the process equipment have been developed, implemented, and are maintained in Micron's document management (MDM) system.  The procedures for ammonia delivery include the following:\n\n\n\n* Steps for each operating phase;\n\n* Operating limits;\n\n* Safety and health considerations; and\n\n* Safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures are available to those that operate and/or maintain the equipment electronically. The operating procedures will be reviewed to ensure they reflect the current practice, including any changes that may have occurred. The existing Periodic Document Review process with Facilities will be used to initiate this review. Each manager that controls PSM/RMP procedures will certify annually that procedures are current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nTeam members involved in operating and maintaining the bulk ammonia distribution system and associated equipment will receive training to ensure procedures are performed pro"

In this case, supervisors will evaluate the workers ability to perform the task and certify they are competent to perform the task outlined in the procedure.  For example, a standard maintenance practice for motors and pumps is to have journeyman electricians perform electrical measurements. \n\n\n\nAll training will include a method to verify comprehension such as a written assessment or evaluation by a direct supervisor.  Records of training will be maintained in Micron's Train system.  All training will require a 3 year recertification which will be obtained through classroom training, computer based assessment or direct supervisor evaluation depending on the complexity of the task. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nInspection and testing schemes are established for all equipment in the process to ensure on-going integrity and that equipment is installed properly and maintained within design specifications.  The testing and inspections align with manufacturers recommendations and are tracked in Maximo as PM events performed by trained employees. The Maximo record will capture the date, person performing the inspection/test, the serial number or other identifier of the equipment, a description of the inspection/test performed, and the results.
