              "Description": "This section describes the ammonia (anhydrous) bulk distribution system units and explains how the prevention program safeguards apply to each unit as required by this part.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia (anhydrous) Bulk Distribution System consists of the following major units:\n\n\n\n1.  Storage System (process hazard analysis [PHA] assessed this unit on November 17, 2011)\n\n- Primary International Organization for Standardization (ISO) container\n\n- Backup ISO container\n\n- Connecting Pigtails\n\n2.  Pressure Control System (PHA assessed this unit on November 17, 2011)\n\n- High Pressure Control Manifold\n\n3.  Purge Module (PHA assessed this unit on November 17, 2011)\n\n4.  Gas Distribution Box (GDB), Valve Manifold Box (VMB) & Gas Isolation Box (PHA assessed these units on March 7, March 8, and April 10, 2012)\n\n\n\nCommon prevention program elements (i.e. process safety information, PHA, written operating procedures, training mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, contractors, and emergency response) applies to all units in the process with specific process controls and mitigation measures as described below.\n\n\n\nStorage System:\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) for the very high flow (VHF) bulk distribution system is sourced from ISO containers received from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.?s Specialty Gas facility located in Hometown, PA.  The ISO containers are located outdoors under a canopy structure on Micron?s property.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is a liquefied compressed gas with a vapor pressure dependent on ambient temperature (114 psig at 70?F).  Each ISO container vessel is housed in an ISO standard metallic frame of approximately 8 feet 6 inches high, 8 feet wide, and 20 feet long dimensions. Each full ISO container holds approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia (anhydrous).  Safety relief devices (dual rupture discs and safety relief valves in series) are installed on the vessels, and a protective ?crash box? is provided around the vessel valving and connections.  This crash box incorporates two vapor valve connection points and one liquid valve connection point, with all valves pneumatically actuated.  All withdrawal connections have excess flow valves installed internal to the vessel wall but the customer will only be connecting to one vapor withdrawal VCR fitting.  This single outlet fitting is connected to a ?-inch diameter stainless steel flexible hose pigtail that delivers the product to the VHF pigtail cabinets.  Each ISO/ pigtail has pneumatic valves providing automatic shutoff (ASO), purge gas introduction, and vacuum venturi evacuation capability.  The pigtails also utilize instrumentation (pressure transducers, pressure switches, and temperature switches) to allow fully automated operation and control.  Each ISO container and process lines are provided with external heat input capability; the container via an integral electrical heating blanket and the piping line via heat tracing.  Truck scales are employed so as the ammonia (anhydrous) is consumed until a pre-set low weight warning is received from the scale alarm.  On a low alarm signal, the VHF BSGS control system will automatically switch to the backup ISO container source for ammonia (anhydrous).  The ammonia (anhydrous) transfer hose connected to the ISO container is double-contained via an exhausted shroud which is connected to the piping cabinet.  All pigtail leak sources (valves, fittings, and connections) are housed in the pigtail shroud with exhaust ventilation, loss of exhaust monitoring, and toxic gas monitoring.  Exhaust air enters the shroud near the ISO valve well and flows into the primary piping cabinet. Also, the ISO container crash box connection area has local exhaust snorkels provided to capture and treat fugitive emissions and leaks.  Area ambient gas detection monitors are provided and the underneath canopy area has an automatic water mist system.\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Control System:\n\nThe primary pressure control system incorporates dual high pressure control manifold (HPCM) trains in parallel.  The HPCM trains are identical in design and function to enhance redundancy and operability.  The HPCM trains contain a single pressure-regulating valve that is spring loaded to reduce ammonia (anhydrous) pressure to about 100 psig.  The HCPM delivers gaseous ammonia (anhydrous) to Microns? houseline via ? inch diameter single-wall tubing.  A pre-filter is provided upstream of the pressure regulators.  This is to promote regulator life and prevent particulate contamination from entering the customer?s houseline.  Purge and evacuation capability is provided independently for the HPCM.  Purge gas is obtained from the purge module and a hard-piped vacuum venturi system, powered by house nitrogen, permits evacuation of the HPCM.  The vent lines have a continuous nitrogen trickle flow maintained through them to mitigate corrosion potential due to back-diffusion from the facility?s scrubber.  Various manual valves are provided for system isolation and maintenance.  Pressure transducers, pressure switches, temperature controllers, and temperature switches provide automated monitoring for various operational parameters and alarms for upset conditions.  Excess flow, high heat trace temperature, and high regulator delivery pressure are some of the alarms and shutdowns provided for the HPCM.  A controller monitoring all the instrumentation can respond to system upsets via pneumatic valves in the upstream system.  Venting functions, purging operations, and evacuation operations are automatically performed by the system controller (operator initiated).  The HPCM has a local emergency stop button and a global emergency stop button is located remotely from the VHF BSGS System. Leak sources (valves, fittings, and connections) are housed in the HPCM cabinet with exhaust ventilation, exhaust flow monitoring, and toxic gas monitoring. The pipeline flowmeter is not located inside an exhausted enclosure but is monitored continuously for leaks with a toxic gas monitor tube placed near the device.\n\n\n\nPurge Module:\n\nA purge source is included to permit localized purge and leak check capability of any portion of the VHF BSGS System.  The purge module supplies two tie-ins; one for the purge gas and one for leak check gas sources.  Typically, the purge gas is nitrogen and leak check gas is helium or a helium/nitrogen mixture.  Pressure regulators are provided to maintain proper gas pressures and safety relief valves are installed downstream to prevent overpressurization of the purge module or VHF BSGS System components. Manual valves and pressure gauges enable manual control of purge and leak check operations.\n\n\n\nGas Distribution Box, Valve Manifold Box & Gas Isolation Box:\n\nThe facility gas distribution box (GDB) is an exhausted enclosure that contains isolation valves and mechanical fittings. The GDB will supply lower pressure ammonia (anhydrous) to various locations within the facility. The enclosure also contains future valves for further expansion of the entire delivery system. Purge valves connected to a purge gas source and vent will be used to maintain high purity gas quality. Venting operations are performed through the valve manifold box downstream.\n\n\n\nThe valve manifold box (VMB) is an exhausted enclosure containing pneumatic and manual isolation valves, and pressure regulation.  Ammonia (anhydrous) process gas supplied by the gas distribution box will be supplied to various use points in the facility by individual process gas sticks. Each VMB stick will contain valves for automated purging, process gas pressure regulation and source and delivery pressure monitoring. The VMB has purging capabilities via a purge source where the purge gas is nitrogen and leak check gas is helium. The automated purging process (operator initiated) prepares process piping for maintenance or when future use points are connected to the VMB. \n\n\n\nThe facility gas isolation box (GIB) is an exhausted enclosure near the tool that contains isolation valves, mechanical fittings and purifier vessels. The GIB will supply purified lower pressure ammonia (anhydrous) to the tool. Each purifier has a built in bypass to allow removal or maintenance while maintaining flow to the use point. Each GIB contain purge and vent valves connected to piping that will allow safe purging and venting of process gas during maintenance.\n\n",

Records of training will be maintained in Micron's Train system.  All training will require a 3 year recertification which will be obtained through classroom training, computer based assessment or direct supervisor evaluation depending on the complexity of the task. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nInspection and testing schemes are established for all equipment in the process to ensure on-going integrity and that equipment is installed properly and maintained within design specifications.  The testing and inspections align with manufacturers recommendations and are tracked in Maximo as PM events performed by trained employees. The Maximo record will capture the date, person performing the inspection/test, the serial number or other identifier of the equipment, a description of the inspection/test performed, and the results. Equipment deficiencies that are outside acceptable limits will require additional controls to run the equipment safely (or not run the equipment) until corrections can be made. Appropriate checks and inspections have been performed to assure that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nChanges to the system or the process will be reviewed and approved before they occur. The review process for each change will involve team members from Safety, Environmental, F"
