Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Food Services of Atlanta are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the College Park Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The Maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 15,500 pounds.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Sysco Food Services of Atlanta Ammonia (anhydrous) system.  The scenario involves a release of 3044 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 304.4 and a distance to endpoint of .3 miles is obtained which effects a residential population of 335 within this "

This scenario involves the release of 1700 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 170 and a distance to endpoint of .1 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 57.\n\nThere are no Flammables Worst-Case or Alternative-Case analysis for this facility.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place for our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertist in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings releated to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a "

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Food Services of Atlanta to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Sysco Food Services of Atlanta.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta "

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.  Sysco Food Services of Atlanta has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards releated to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.  5-Year Accident History:\n\nSysco Food Services of Atlanta has implemented a proactive system to prevent accidents.
