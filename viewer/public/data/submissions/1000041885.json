      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009. Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n\n\n?

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\n\n\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\n\n\nThe Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station is located adjacent to the Green-Verdugo reservoir, on the west portion of Tujunga Ranch, at 10320 Sunland Boulevard in Sunland, California.  The Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station serves to chlorinate water outflow from, and the stored water in, the Green-Verdugo reservoir.

The station consists of a chlorination room (with a mini-scrubber), an instrument room, and a pump operations room. The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  There is a maximum of four chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station.  All four containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas. The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unstaffed and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Green-Verdugo Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\n\n\nThere is a maximum of four chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. All four containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container. Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum-regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum-regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine PVC header lines to one or more of the five chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve.

The mini-scrubber can neutralize up to 25 lbs of chlorine, and the media manufacturer specifies chlorine removal to less than 5 parts per billion.
