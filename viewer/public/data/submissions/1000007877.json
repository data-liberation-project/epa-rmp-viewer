Previously, we submitted a plan as a post-incident requirement for the explosion which occurred at the Sterigenics Ontario facility on August 19, 2004.  Although there were no fatalities or hospitalizations as a result of the incident, there was major facility and equipment damage.  No significant changes have been made since the previous submittal.\n\nIntruduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Program (RMP) to U.S. EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community .  The RMP includes the following information:\nA? Introduction;\nA? Facility identification and regulated substances;\nA? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\nA? Hazard Assessment;\nA? Prevention Program;\nA? Five-Year Accident History;\nA? Emergency Response Plan; and\nA? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Ontario, California.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics EO - Ontario.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the enviro"

      "SummaryText": "nment.\n\nPrevention Program \n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\nA? Process safety information is accessible at all times.\nA? A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\nA? Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\nA? Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\nA? Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\nA? A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\nA? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\nA? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\nA? A thorough Preventative Maintenance Program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\n\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Ontario facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety. Sterigenics has also implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be follow"

These scenarios are included with Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis). \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n1. The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n2. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\nA? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\nA? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nSterigenics has had one accidental releases from the ehylene oxide process within the last five years that meets this definition.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Ontario facility are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Local Fire Department.\n\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" Sterigenics also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified.\n\nChemical-Specific Safety\n\nEthylene oxide is stored in an outdoor staging area that is cool, dry, well-ventilated and away from incompatible chemicals and sources of ignition.  Storage containers are insulated and have pressure relief valves. Lowe"
