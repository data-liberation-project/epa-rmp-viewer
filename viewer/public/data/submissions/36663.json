We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation\n- An overview of our accident release prevention programs\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00bfs RMP rule\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment\n- The certifications that EPA\u00bfs and RMP rule requires us to provide\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility produces flexible polyurethane foam using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The facility is housed in an approximately 100,000 sq.ft. Building located in an industrial area.  The process area is divided into two areas; one being the process building, which houses the tank farm, which is diked, and the process area located in the lower half of the process building. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nTOXICS \u00bf Toluene Diisocyante\nFLAMMABLES \u00bf None\n\nOur accident release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectiv"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n- Process Hazard Assessment\n- Process Hazard Review\n- Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Mechanical Integrity\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1. Inventory Control of TDI\n2. Two-way communication during off-loading\n3. Never leaving off-loading area during an operation\n4. High level alarm on TDI tanks\n5. Standard Operating Procedures\n6. Preventative maintenance of TDI off-loading equipment\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accidental prevention.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical release that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical release involving materials covered under EPA\u00bfs RMP rule during the past five years.\n\nThere has been no accidental release of TDI in the past five years.\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

Off-loading station:\na. Air compressor dryer\nb. Off-loading station consisting of interlocks for TDI tanks that will shutdown off-loading automatically when tank levels are too high.\nc. Dry-disconnect couplings and remote actuated emergency shut-off valve for tank car.\nd. Tank car spill pan system\ne. Earthen berm to contain minor spillage\n\n2. Process Control Area:\na. Automated sensors to shutdown system in the event that pressures are out of range for TDI or Polyol."
