Listed are the way which we train, who we train, what organizations we cooperate with in training and other methods we use .\n\nThe manager of Schafer Fertilizer, Inc. is trained as a Medical First Responder which enables him to manage most medical emergencies.  Our personnel are members of Wellsville Fire Dept.  which are given yearly tours of our plant .  These are a few of the policies put in place by the company.  More details will be given later in this report.\n\nOur facility handles anhydrous ammonia for the purpose of agricultural fertilizer.  There is one storage tank on the site which hold 13,000 gallons.  This is the size used in our worst-case release scenario and alternate release scenario.  Being in a rural area  our worst case sceenario would travel  1 mile and no  population would be effected.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years. \n\nThe manager of the anhydrous storage plant gives a tour of the facilities each year to the locla police department and the fire department.  This shows them any changes that have been made and familirizes them with the plant.  Also plans are gone over for what is to be done in case of an accidental release."
