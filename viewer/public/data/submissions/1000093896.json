Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\r\n \r\n The emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes providing them with a copy of the ERP and a subsequent telephone call and invitation to tour the plant.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."

We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\r\n\r\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and one railcar) at our plant is about 534,000 lb.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\r\n\r\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios:\r\n\r\nDELETED in Accordance with 4/19/2004 Rulemaking.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule, which specifies that we notify and coordinate with local emergency planning agencies.\r\n\r\nWe have coordinated with HEPACO, LLC (contracted professional emergency response firm) and the Prentiss County Development Commission.\r\n\r\n The TDI process at our plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
