The Oklahoma Pollution Discharge Elimination System (OPDES) permit issued by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) mandated disinfection of the treated effluent.  To satisfy this requirement, the City has completed a New Chlorination and Dechlorination disinfection facility.  This facility will house chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on-site in a quantity that exceeded the threshold limits defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act.  To meet the requirement of 40 CFR 86, the City has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The City of Oklahoma City and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated chemicals and are committed to maintaining and implementing the RMP procedures. \n\nThe SCWWTP is one of the four treatment plants, all plants are City owned.  The other three plants have had disinfection requirements for sometime and have been using chlorination and dechlorination successfully.  All plants are operated by the same operator who is fully trained for these processes.  \n\nTreatment processes use chlorine for the disinfection (inactivation of pathogens) of effluent discharge.  Any residual chlorine is removed from the effluent by dechlorination (or removal of chlorine) with sulfur dioxide.  \n \nThe chemical system components at the plant comply with one or more of the following standards: Chlorine Institute, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, Oklahoma Department Environmental Quality (DEQ) standards, and ASME Standards.  In addition, regular maintenance and thorough training sessions for employees will minimize the potential for an accidental release.  \n\nIn case of a small leak with no potential safety or health hazard, plant personnel would att"
