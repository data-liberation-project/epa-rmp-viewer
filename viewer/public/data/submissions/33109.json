Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store ice cream and related products.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 16,800 pounds (i.e., 3,400 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the manufacturing high pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much as 6,000 pounds of liquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 80%).  However, during typical operation, the vessel contains only 1,900 pounds of ammonia.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Decatur plant consists of two, separate subsystems--the \"manufacturing system\" and the \"mezzanine system\".  These two subsystems are connected together by piping, but are typically isolated from each other and operated independently.  The connections are usually only opened to trans"

      "SummaryText": "fer ammonia between the systems.  \r\n\r\nThe entire system contains approximately 16,800 pounds of ammonia in various states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Cooling is accomplished by changing the pressure of the ammonia and expanding it from a lower, to a higher, pressure.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing system is a two-stage system consisting of a high (pressure) side and a low side.  The mezzanine system is single-stage, but operates at the same suction pressure as the low side of the manufacturing system.\r\n\r\nLiquid ammonia is received by truck into a nurse tank.  On occasion, when ammonia must be added to either system, it is transferred from the nurse tank.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2.1    Manufacturing System\r\nThe high stage compressor suction for the manufacturing system draws from the intercooler/high accumulator (booster discharge) at an intermediate pressure of about 25 psig.  This accumulator traps suction from the room evaporator coils, glycol chiller, and refrigerated storage tanks and returns its excess liquid to the low accumulator.\r\n\r\nAmmonia suction from the low side (low pressure and, therefore, low temperature) at about 0 psig or below is collected in the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors (boosters).  The low side load units in the manufacturing system include the ice cream freezers, the Amerio liquid recirculation tank (cycle center), and the Amerio plate hardener.  Excess liquid from the low accumulator is transferred back to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas at 150 psig) is vented to roof-mounted cooling towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting of certain units and operation of a pumper drum for the slop tank.\r\n\r\nThe condensed liquid from the cooling towers drains into the high pressure receiver where it is then fed (by pressure) to the high side load units.  Condensed liquid is also fed to a liquid cooler (mounted inside the intercooler) before being used by the low-side load un"

      "SummaryText": "its.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2.2    Mezzanine System\r\nThe mezzanine system uses three screw-type compressors which operate at a suction pressure of less than 0 psig and a discharge pressure of 150 psig.  Unlike the manufacturing system, the mezzanine does not have an intermediate pressure stage of 25 psig and all load units operate on the low side.  These load units include six air handling units used to maintain storage freezers at temperatures of -20oF to -40oF.\r\n\r\nThe hot gas from the mezzanine compressors is condensed to liquid in roof-mounted cooling towers.  Some hot gas is also used for defrosting.  The liquid drains vertically from the condensing towers, through a thermosyphon receiver, and into the high pressure receiver (HPR).  The liquid from the HPR is fed (by pressure) through three pre-coolers before going out to three of the six load units.  Pre-cooled liquid is also used to cool the screw compressors.  Oil for the screw compressors is cooled by recirculating liquid ammonia around the oil separator for each compressor.  The liquid ammonia is recirculated by the siphon effect caused by the condensed liquid draining through the thermosyphon receiver.\r\n\r\nLow-side suction returning from the mezzanine load units is collected in the cycle center (accumulator) before entering the compressors.  Excess liquid is pumped to the remaining load units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3        SAFETY SYSTEMS\r\n\r\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  These include pressure relief valves, engine room ventilation, and safety interlocks.  \r\n\r\nSafety relief valves (SRVs) protect the compressor discharge, condensors, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and liquid recirculation system from overpressurization.  SRVs on the compressor discharge and condensers are set at 250 psig.  SRVs for the suction vessels are set at 150 psig.\r\n\r\nSafety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats"

If the pressure continues to rise to 200 psig, the compressors and boosters are shut down.  If the intermediate pressure increases to 30 psig, an alarm also sounds.  \r\n\r\nFloat switches on the suction vessels alarm when a high level is reached.  If the liquid level continues to rise, additional float switches and/or level control shut off the appropriate compressors or boosters to avoid slugging.\r\n\r\nTo adjust for changing refrigeration loads, system pressures (compressor operation) are controlled by a step controller for the manufacturing system and a programmable logic controller for the mezzanine system.  These controls include delay timers to prevent short cycling (frequent start-up/shutdown/start-up) of the compressors and boosters.  In addition, the cooling towers include a system which automatically supplies city water in the event of water pump failure (to prevent a sudden increase in the high-side discharge pressure).\r\n\r\nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\r\n\r\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\r\n\r\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the system;\r\n\r\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and\r\n\r\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing valves in the liquid lines.\r\n\r\n2.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\r\n\r\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if...\" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.

The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.
