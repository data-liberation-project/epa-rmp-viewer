      "SummaryText": "The Olympic Regional Development Authority (ORDA) is an agency of the State of New York that manages the existing bobsled and luge facilities at the Verizon Sports Complex at Mt. Van Hoevenberg, in the Town of North Elba, near Lake Placid, NY.  Like the other facilities in and around Lake Placid that ORDA operates and maintains, the original bobsled and luge faciliy was constructed for the 1980 Olympic Games.  The existing facility includes two tracks.  The combined track became operational in February, 2000.\n\nThe Mt. Van Hoevenberg facility includes an industrial refrigeration system which utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Since the refrigeration system uses greater than 10,000-lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, the facility is subject to the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation.  ORDA has developed a written  Risk Management Program (RMP) to ensure the safe use of anydrous ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system operates on a seasonal basis, typically operating between November and March.  During the off-season, the refrigeration system is shutdown.  During winter operation, the facility is staffed 24/7. \n\nAs required by regulation, ORDA has completed a hazard assessment, evaluating both a worst case scenario (WCS) and alternate release scenario (ARS) involving hypothetical ammonia releases.  Both the WCS and ARS identified the potential for impacts to public receptors.\n\nKey components of the RMP include:\n\n          -   Process Safety Inforation\n          -   Process Hazard Analysis\n          -   Written Standard Operating Procedures \n          -   Mechanical Integrity\n          -   Operator Training\n          -   Incident Investigation\n          -   Management of Change\n\nORDA has a well developed and detailed Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan has been recently reviewed and updated (July, 2003).  The Plan includes specific procedures for response to a release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.
