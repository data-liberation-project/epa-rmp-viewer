We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClariant is a specialty chemical company based in Switzerland with 130 manufacturing plants worldwide.  We are established as one of the world's leading producers of dyes, dye intermediates, pigments, and specialty chemicals.  The Coventry Site is one of Clariant's primary manufacturing plants.  \n\nClariant's assets at the Coventry Site include production buildings, site infrastructure including a boiler house and a wastewater treatment plant, laboratories, warehouses, and an administration building.  Coventry Site employees include approximately 300 Clariant employees and 20 contract maintenance and sec"

Our pigment products are used in the coloration of house paint; automotive and industrial coatings; plastics for packaging; automotive components; household items; films and fibers; printing inks for magazines, packaging, advertising fliers and newspapers; toner for copiers; and crayons, pens and artist's colors.  In our processes, we use the following two chemicals that the Environmental Protection Agency has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxic Chemical        Maximum Inventory                             Use                               \n\nBromine            104,000 lbs.        Manufacture of pigment intermediates\nSulfur Trioxide (SO3)        128,000 lbs.        Manufacture of pigment intermediates\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's Risk Management rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nSulfur Trioxide (SO3) - Failure of the transfer line from the storage building to the production building resulting in a liquid spill of sulfur trioxide to the roadway between the tank farm and the production building.  Amount released is total content of the transfer line.  No mitigation is employed.  The release would have off-site consequences.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemica"

Quantity spilled is maximum volume of unloading hose and associated piping.  Passive mitigation is employed, as the spill drains into the unloading sump.  No active mitigation is considered.  The release would have off-site consequences.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Coventry Site complies with all EPA and OSHA accident prevention requirements at 40 CFR Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910.  We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nThese individual elements work together to ensure that sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities, and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nBoth the Bromine and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks are located in dikes designed to contain a tank release and both tanks are located inside buildi"

As a result of these two passive mitigation measures, the amount of vapor released to the atmosphere in the event of a \"worst-case type\" release is reduced by over 99.5%. \n\nUnloading of bromine and sulfur trioxide occur in truck bays with sumps to contain a release.  The truck bays are also equipped with either a foam system or a dry spray system to cover a release and thus minimize vaporization of the spilled material.\n\nSensors are used in the processing areas to detect small leaks of bromine and sulfur trioxide.  The sensors are connected to audible alarms that alert personnel so that the small leaks can be repaired before a release with off-site consequence occurs.\n\nProcess control systems with interlock, alarms, and automatic shutoffs are used in both the bromine and sulfur trioxide processing areas.  Manual shutoffs are also available in the processing areas as well as both storage buildings and truck unloading bays.\n\nBromine and sulfur trioxide processing and storage vessels are equipped with safety and relief valves to prevent over pressurization.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Coventry Site keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  We have not had a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in on-site injury or off-site impact during the past five years.\n\nWe have a comprehensive incident investigation program.  For all incidents and near miss incidents, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.  The employee success sharing annual bonus is currently based in part on the identification and correction of root causes of incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Coventry Site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

Additionally, the Coventry Site hosts an annual community drill with local community responders.\n\nWe have a 24-hour Emergency Response Team (ERT) with nearly 40 members trained in emergency response, incipient stage fire fighting, and hazardous materials requirements.  Several ERT members are certified Emergency Medical Technicians.  Training requirements are rigorous and all members must pass a physical exam.  The site has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and sprinkler systems.   We also maintain an emergency response vehicle equipped with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, and emergency response and decontamination materials.\n\nThe Coventry Site has an established partnership with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire departments.  An automated telephone Community Alert Network (CAN) and neighbor hotline are used to notify neighbors of a site emergency and actions to be taken.\n\nOUR GOAL: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nAt Clariant, we are committed to continuous improvement of Environment, Safety, and Health performance.  Through our Process Safety Management program, we review hazards associated with our processes and implement actions to reduce the hazards according to risk assessment/risk management principles."
