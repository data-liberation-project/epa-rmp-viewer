We maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nThese individual elements work together to ensure that sufficient layers of protection exist through technology, facilities, and personnel to prevent escalation from a single failure to a catastrophic event.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nBoth the Bromine and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks are located in dikes designed to contain a tank release and both tanks are located inside buildi"

      "SummaryText": "ngs.  As a result of these two passive mitigation measures, the amount of vapor released to the atmosphere in the event of a worst-case type release is reduced by over 99.5%. \n\nUnloading of bromine and sulfur trioxide occur in truck bays with sumps to contain a release.  The truck bays are also equipped with either a foam system or a dry spray system to cover a release and thus minimize vaporization of the spilled material.\n\nSensors are used in the processing areas to detect small leaks of bromine and sulfur trioxide.  The sensors are connected to audible alarms that alert personnel so that the small leaks can be repaired before a release with off-site consequence occurs.\n\nProcess control systems with interlock, alarms, and automatic shutoffs are used in both the bromine and sulfur trioxide processing areas.  Manual shutoffs are also available in the processing areas as well as both storage buildings and truck unloading bays.\n\nBromine and sulfur trioxide processing and storage vessels are equipped with safety and relief valves to prevent over pressurization.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Coventry Site keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  We have not had a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in on-site injury or off-site impact during the past five years.\n\nWe have a comprehensive incident investigation program.  For all incidents and near miss incidents, we conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.  The employee success sharing annual bonus is currently based in part on the identification and correction of root causes of incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Coventry Site maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting w"

Additionally, the Coventry Site hosts an annual community drill with local community responders.\n\nWe have a 24-hour Emergency Response Team (ERT) with nearly 40 members trained in emergency response, incipient stage fire fighting, and hazardous materials requirements.  Several ERT members are certified Emergency Medical Technicians.  Training requirements are rigorous and all members must pass a physical exam.  The site has an extensive fire fighting system with monitor nozzles, hoses, foam generating capability, and sprinkler systems.   We also maintain an emergency response vehicle equipped with air monitoring equipment, radio and cellular phone systems, and emergency response and decontamination materials.\n\nThe Coventry Site has an established partnership with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire departments.  An automated telephone Community Alert Network (CAN) and neighbor hotline are used to notify neighbors of a site emergency and actions to be taken.\n\nOUR GOAL: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nAt Clariant, we are committed to continuous improvement of Environment, Safety, and Health performance.  Through our Process Safety Management program, we review hazards associated with our processes and implement actions to reduce the hazards according to risk assessment/risk management principles."
