      "SummaryText": "US Foods Denver - The faclity is an operational food warehouse and cold storage. At this facility, we store various food products which are later distributed to restaurants and other customers. Like most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system.\n\nUS Foods Denver is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation and food distribution environment. We are committed to obeying local, state, and federal laws that apply to our business and ammonia system. To ensure compliance with EPA's RMP and OSHA PSM requirements, we have developed an extensive Process Safety Management System. Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. The facility Process Safety Management Program includes the following programs.\n\n(1)Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate elements of the program.\n\n(2)Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to system design, maintenance, and ammonia exposure information. \n\n(3)Process Hazards Analysis: We conducted a detailed PHA of the ammonia system to identify  hazards and potential operational problems.\n\n(4)Operating Procedures: We provide written Standards of Operation for the ammonia system. These procedures help our staff ensure the ammonia system operates within the designated safe limits.\n\n(5)Mechanical Integrity: We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance utilized by our maintenance staff and contractors.\n\n(6) Training: Our employees and maintenance staff are trained in safe operation of the ammonia system and emergency procedures to be followed in the event of a release.\n\n(7) Management of Change: The MOC Process ensures that any design changes or modifications to the ammonia system are formally reviewed to ensure they are within the safety design specifications. \n\n(8) Pre-Startup Safety Review: Any system change or modification that couold have an impact on the ammonia system safety is evaluated after ins"

All contractors receive a Facility Orientation on the hazards of ammonia and emergency procedures. Those contractors that are working on the ammonia system or could impact the safety of the system receive additional training on facility work practices and procedures.\n\n(10)Hot Work Permits: We follow the Hot Work Permitting Process for all spark or flame producing operations. \n\n(11)Emergency Response: To ensure the safety of our employeesm contractors, and the general public, we have developed an Emergecny Action Plan. Response to emergencies is coordinated with the local Fire Department.\n\n(12)Incident Investigation: All incidents are investigated to determine the incident causes so corrective actions can be identified and improvements made.\n\n(13)Compliance Audits: Approximately every 3 years, we conduct a compliance assessment of our PSM Program to determine those elements which need improvement and to verify compliance to the program.\n\n(14) Trade Secrets: Our Trade Secrets Program is maintained for compliance.\n\nAs stipulated by 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1), the \"worst-case\" and \"alternate case\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios were calculated and the results are on file at the facility and have been submitted to EPA in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels. See the Risk Management Plan,available from the EPA, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S.Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose theactual numerical data in this Executive Summary.\n\nNo accidential releases of ammonia have occurred in the past 5 years."
