Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Kirschenman Lamont Facility are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.     The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass cold storage of fruit. We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and it is used as a refrigerant in our cold storage system.\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 17,100lbs.\n\n       \n3.     The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. \n\nProcess Safety Information: \nKirschenman Lamont Facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineeri"

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 6/10/2008\n\nOperating Procedures: \nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Kirschenman Lamont Facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. \n\nTraining: \nKirschenman Lamont Facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed. The most recent training was performed on 9/23/2008\n\nMechanical Integrity: \nKirschenman Lamont Facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The most recent equipment inspection was performed on 03/15/2009\n\nManagement of Change: \nWritten procedures are in place at Kirschenman Lamont Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 05/10/2008."

      "SummaryText": " Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification. \n\nPre-startup Reviews: \nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Kirschenman Lamont Facility. The most recent review was performed on 04/24/2008. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation. \n\nCompliance Audits: \nKirschenman Lamont Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 06/10/2007. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. \n\nIncident Investigation:\nKirschenman Lamont Facility will promptly investigate any incident that can result in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nKirschenman Lamont Facility truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilityA?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Kirschenman Lamont Facility has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractors work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History:\n\nKirschenman Lamont Facility has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n 5.    Emergency Response Plan:\n\nKirschenman Lamont Facility carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The most recent E- response plan update was 09/2007\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.
