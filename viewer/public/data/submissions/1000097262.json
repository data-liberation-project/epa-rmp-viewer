This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Seneca County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nEvans Chemetics was formed in Waterloo during the early 1940s to manufacture divalent sulfur compounds for the hair care and cosmetic industries.  Since that time, the number of products has grown to over 30, serving the cosmetic, plastics, and specialty chemical industries.  The products manufactured are sold to other manufactures as raw materials and ingredients in their final products.\n\n\n\nIn our processes, Evans Chemetics uses three regulated substances, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile],epichlorohydrin [oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], and a 29% ammonia water solution.  Acrylonitrile is used as a raw material to manufacture a variety of products, including secondary antioxidants for plastics and rubber and polymerization chain transfer agents.  Epichlorohydrin is also used as a raw material to manufacture products used in the photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.  29% ammonia water is used to as a raw material to manufacture products for the personal care industry and to adjust pH on an ammonium sulfate byproduct solution prior to sale. All three chemicals are received by tank truck, and unloaded into vapor balanc"

Transfers from the bulk storage tanks to the site reactors are done in closed piping to eliminate employee and community exposure.  The reactions are also carried out in closed systems with numerous process monitoring and controls.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nEvans Chemetics has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  Our Title V air permit was changed to a State only air permit in May 2008.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEvans Chemetics maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specification sheets and maintenance manuals, reactive chemical data, and materials of construction information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The primary hazard analysis methodology is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are maintained on all the chemical processes operated at the facility.  These procedures address various modes of operat"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEvans Chemetics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEvans Chemetics carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Evans Chemetics to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Evans Chemetics.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEvans Chemetics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being "

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEvans Chemetics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEvans Chemetics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Evans Chemetics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and are required to inform Evans Chemetics of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nEvans Chemetics has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of acrylonitrile, epichlorohydrin, or 29% ammonia water during this period as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nAll plant personnel are trained to recognize and initially respond to any release of chemicals.

In addition to Evans Chemetics' own emergency response capability, emergency planning and response is coordinated with the Seneca County LEPC (Local Emergency Response Committee).  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs part of Evans Chemetics' ongoing program to improve safety within the facility and reduce risk to the surrounding community, our processes and procedures are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities. We implemented the following risk reduction or prevention activities:\n\n\n\n1) Added additional instrumentation on the acrylonitrile and epichlorohydrin bulk storage tanks to provide redundancy on continuous level and pressure monitoring\n\n2) Added additional safety systems to the process overpressure catch tank to improve the detection, containment, and processing of a process rupture disk release.\n\n3) Improved the site mechanical integrity testing procedures\n\n\n\nEvans Chemetics will continue to improve safety through a regular cycle of safety reviews and PHAs, with further safety systems and procedures added to address the additional hazards found.\n\n"
