LLC, Ashdown Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Ashdown Mill workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the Company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Regulation, 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the Risk Management Program at the Domtar A.W. LLC, Ashdown Mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n1. A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substance regulated by the RMP Rule - see topic 1.2\n    \n2. A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substance (covered process) - see topic 1.4\n    \n3. An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substance from the covered process - see topic 1.6\n\n4. A management system that assigns responsibility for specific elements of the program.  These elements include the preparation and maintenance of the hazards assessment, accident prevention program (including OSHA PSM), and emergency response plan, Risk Management Plan preparation, submittal, and communication.

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n\nAshdown Mill minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nAshdown Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to reduce the potential for injuries and/or environmental damage to occur in the event of a release. \n\nThe safety program at Ashdown Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMP is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nAshdown Mill is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/or the environment. Ashdown Mill provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the General Manager.\n\n\n1.2 DOMTAR A.W. LLC AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nDomtar A.W. LLC is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (C102) for the use of bleaching pulp.  The Chlorine Dioxide System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.\n\n    \n1.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n    \nDomtar A.W. LLC has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3-prevention program would become a requirement for this process as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the"
