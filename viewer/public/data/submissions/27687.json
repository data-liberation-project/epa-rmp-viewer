If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact  of the release to people and the environment.\n\nA description of our facility and any regulated substanses handled:\nthe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\nAnhydrous ammonia is recieved, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\nThe mazimum quantity stored would be 124,800 pounds in our two storage tanks.\n\nThe worst case scenerio and alternative scenerio:\nThe worst case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 124,800 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\nThe alternative release scenerio based on the most likely potential incidents is the release from a break in a transfer hose, a pipe leak, overfilling, or an excess flow valve failure.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program:\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Hanaling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\"\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n*have causedany deaths, injuries"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
