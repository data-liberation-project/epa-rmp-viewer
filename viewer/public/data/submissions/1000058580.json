Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: \r\n\r\nDaily's Premium Meats is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility responds defensively only, and the St, Joseph's Fire Department would respond to a release.   \r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled: \r\n\r\nOnly one regulated extremely hazardous substance is present at the facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 23,000 pounds. \r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps: \r\n\r\nAll Seaboard Foods LLC manufacturing locations comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards.  The system includes ammonia detection devices, an emergency shutdown switch located outside the main mechanical room, high- and low-level switches in pressure vessels, and safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure.  Periodic maintenance on the refrigeration"

Annual physical system audits are performed by an external refrigeration contractor to ensure system integrity.\r\n\r\n4. Five Year Accident History: \r\n\r\nThis is a new facility so there have been no reportable accidents or incidents at this facility during the past five years. \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Action Plan: \r\n\r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan. The emergency plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia. The emergency action plan also includes procedures for informing the public and local, state and federal response agencies of an ammonia release. This plan also identifies the facility First Responders. These are designated employees who have been certified in First Aid, CPR and emergency evacuation. \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: \r\n\r\nAll employees will be trained on ammonia safety and emergency evacuation at least annually.  Only qualified, specifically trained personnel will operate and maintain our ammonia plant.  Recommendations from the initial PHA, and the compliance audit to be conducted within three years will be managed in a timely manner."
