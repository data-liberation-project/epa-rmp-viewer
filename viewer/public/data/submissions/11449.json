(Polychemie)\nhas reviewed and enhanced previously existing accidental release procedures and emergency\nresponse policies.  These policies include:\n    *   an emergency response sequence\n    *   emergency response to fires, explosions, and environmental releases\n    *   notification and reporting to regulatory agencies in the event of a reportable\n        release\n    *   emergency response to hurricanes, floods, and bomb threats\n    *   spill prevention control and countermeasure (SPCC) plan\n    *   identification and training of an emergency response team\n    *   emergency coordinator and regulatory call lists\n    *   emergency equipment list and location\n    *   sensitive materials storage list\n    *   material profiles and material safety data sheets for major raw materials on site. \n\nThere is one substance at the Polychemie facility that is currently regulated by the Chemical\nAccident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR Part 68.  This substance is used in various\nprocesses throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  Specifically, the facility\nproduces diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC).  Substances that are used by\nPolychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part\n68 are as follows:\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n          No substances currently subject to RMP.\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n     Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is used in the DADMAC process as a reactant.\n     Dimethylamine is received and stored in anhydrous form. The maximum amount of\n     anhydrous dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately 380,000 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Scenarios:\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program Rule, worst case and alternative release scenarios\nwere evaluated and are discussed"

      "SummaryText": " in this RMP.  As required, a  worst case scenario is presented in\nthe RMP for the one flammable substance.  An alternative scenario was also prepared for the \nflammable substance since the worst-case endpoint was located off site.  The endpoint represents\nthe distance at which the effects from a released substance do not pose potential serious risk to\nthe public.  \n\nFor the worst case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest\ndistance to a specified endpoint.  For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\nrelease is simply assumed to take place and the greatest amount held in a vessel is suddenly\nreleased.  The results of the worst case scenario analysis were as follows:\n\n     Flammable Substances: A dimethylamine storage tank was assumed to fail and\n     subsequently produce an instantaneous release of the entire tank contents that results in a\n     vapor cloud explosion.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in limiting the\n     release impacts.  The distance to the explosion endpoint was estimated to be less than\n     0.43 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios:\n\nAlternative release scenarios are more realistic scenarios that result in endpoints that affect public\nreceptors. For dimethylamine, the alternative release scenario assumed that dimethylamine was\nreleased as a result of the uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations. The\nalternative release scenario was assumed to occur over a 1-minute time period. With the\nexception of considering that these transfer operations are monitored by personnel at all times, no\nother mitigating controls were assumed to limit the release.  The results of the alternative release\nscenario analysis were as follows:\n\n          Flammable Substance:\n                    "

      "SummaryText": "Dimethylamine - <0.06 miles\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with\nchemical specific prevention steps has been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     *    Written operating procedures and emergency shutdown procedures.\n     *    Engineering controls to include that all valves fail in the safe position on loss of motive\n            power.  Safe position is \"closed\" in most cases.\n     *    Emergency responders trained in the plant.\n     *    Contract emergency responders on 24-hour call.\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\nrequirements for dimethylamine.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility also has an emergency response program (ERP) in association with the \nimplementation  of the Risk Management Program.  The ERP will be coordinated with the local\nfire department.  As part of community involvement efforts, the facility's management has\ncoordinated an emergency response drill with the local fire department, police department, and\nambulance service which will take place in May 1999.\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed. Since\nPolychemie is a new facility, no accidental releases from covered processes have occurred that\nresulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in off-\nsite evacuations or sheltering in place. \n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include continuous review and update of the facility's ERP, continued\nmanagement of the plant Safety Work Order System, and yearly emergency drills with the\ncommunity to determine and improve upon deficiencies."
