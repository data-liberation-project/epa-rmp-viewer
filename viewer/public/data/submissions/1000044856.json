This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\nUNIVAR USA Inc carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis performed at this facility, existing safeguards have been determined to be\r\nadequate and no changes are warranted at the present time.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT\r\n\r\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, forme"
