Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Formaldehyde 37% Solution and Aqueous Ammonia 30%. \n\n\n\nListed below are the ways the three RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. \n\n\n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is packaged and stored in 55 gal and 330 gal containers in our warehouse for distribution to our end use customers.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nVopak USA Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nVopak USA Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nUNIVAR USA  Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at UNIVAR USA Inc to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release of Formaldehyde 37%, Aqueous Ammonia 30% or Hydrofluoric Acid 70% has occurred during this period.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis performed at this facility, existing safeguards have been determined to be\n\nadequate and no changes are warranted at the present time.\n\n\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT\n\n\n\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, forme"
