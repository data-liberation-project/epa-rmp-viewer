In 1988-1990, the facility was modernized and upgraded once more, and while designed for production of up to 32 mgd it currently operates at a maximum of 32 mgd by a permit granted by the California Department of Public Health in 1998 the WTP replaced its on-site 6 million gallon reservoir. The system for handling chlorine was installed during the 1988-1990 modernization. \r\n\u00a0\r\nChlorine is used at the WTP to disinfect raw water drawn from the Contra Costa Canal or from wells operated by the City.  Chlorine is typically packaged as a liquefied gas under pressure in steel containers. One ton cylinders of Chlorine are used at the WTP, thus exceeding the 2500-pound threshold amount set by the EPA, 1500 pounds set by OSHA and the 100-pound limit set by the State of California.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe limits of the processes include all the equipment, facilities and procedures to handle chlorine while it is under pressure.  Once chlorine reaches the mixing equipment, it is no longer in concentrations that would make it hazardous and pose little risk to workers and no risk to the public.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSpecific quantities handled and details of the systems are included in the details of the applicable compliance submittals to both EPA and Contra Costa County.\r\ni-4  Worst Case Release Scenario\r\nAs required by both EPA and California regulations, the City has evaluated the worst case scenario for chlorine using parameters mandated in those regulations.  The City's limiting worst-case scenario is the rupture of one chlorine cylinder and the loss of the entire contents over at 10-minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using tables and equations provided by the EPA. \r\n\u00a0\r\nThe chlorine liquid release is assumed to form a 1 cm pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has not been assumed to be limited by any controls.  The EPA as a part of this analysis mandates a c"

Events and preventions considered in the design and operation of the facility include, but are not limited to: security, temperature extremes, earthquakes, winds, excessive precipitation, utility disruption, and wildland fires.  \r\n\u00a0\r\nOf particular interest, given its California location, is earthquake susceptibility.  The hazardous materials area of the WTP was completely revamped in the late 1980's and includes the best ground motion technology available.  Additionally, the WTP is on solid ground which limits the severity of ground motion.  The WTP has conducted independent assessments of risks associated with lateral ground motion. Although there will be damage to equipment from a worst credible earthquake, studies have indicated that catastrophic loss of containment should not be a concern.

In addition, the Plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the covered processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe City participates in the Contra Costa County Community Warning System, allowing for communication and notification. The CCHS, in conjunction with Contra Costa County Community Awareness & Emergency Response (CCCCAER), has developed the Community Warning System (CWS) which can be implemented in the event of a release that affects offsite populations. The CWS includes sirens, including one that is located at the WTP, emergency responders are connected through a computer and radio system, the system can activate the EAS, the NWS NOAA Weather Radios, page emergency responders, update information to the media and through the internet, and includes a telephone ring down system. The Community Warning System provides for on-going community outreach to educate the public about the most effective response (usually shelter-in-place) when the sirens sound. \r\n\u00a0\r\ni-9  Continuous Efforts to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the Accidental Release Prevention Program. There is a commitment to continue to improve safety by reviewing, revising, and enhancing written procedures as well as implementing other action items. The CPWTP has removed the Anhydrous Ammonia system and replaced it with an inherently safer Liquid Ammonium Sulfate system. None of the action items resulting from the 2017 Chlorine System PHA are critical or essential, rather they represent enhancements or continuous improvement.  \r\n\u00a0\r\ni-10  External Events Analysis (CalARP Only)\r\nThe WTP is subject to potential external events, which have the poten"

The City provides potable water to their service area, which coincides with the city limits.  As a part of this operation, hazardous materials are used to meet the quality demands of our customers and compliance with regulations, which protect the public health.\r\n\u00a0\r\nA copy of the Water Treatment Plant's Accidental Release Prevention Program policy is included as Figure 1-1.  This policy addresses the City's commitment to preventing accidental releases and to being prepared to respond in the unlikely event that a release should occur.  This RMP is a summary of the specific programs in place, which are incorporated, and a part of our overall safety efforts.\r\n\u00a0\r\ni-2  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policy\r\nThe WTP is owned by the City of Pittsburg and is located at 300 Olympia Drive.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm chlorine as well as the population impacted and sensitive public receptors is listed in the details of this submittal.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe worst-case scenario was developed following EPA regulations and it is not considered to be a likely release scenario for emergency planning.  Historically throughout the chlorine industry, a rupture of one-ton cylinder is rare.  Additionally, EPA mandates that assumed meteorological conditions be the most conservative.  Therefore, the results of this worst-case scenario off-site consequence analysis are extremely conservative.\r\n\u00a0\r\ni-5  Alternative Case Scenarios\r\nThe WTP, considering the history of operations and the staff's experience as well as the hazards identified in the process hazard analyses (PHA), developed more realistic release scenarios or alternative release scenarios (ARS) based on their knowledge and judgment.  These were first presented in the 1995 Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP).  The American Water Works Association Research Foundation's Compliance Guide and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants (AWWA Compliance Guidance) was also used to describe emergency planning scenarios.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe currently used Alternative Case Scenario was chosen from the Process Hazard Analysis performed on January 24, 2017.
