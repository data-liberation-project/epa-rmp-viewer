The location of the facility is 931 East Floodgate Road, Freeport, Texas 77541 in Brazoria County. This summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act 112(r). The facility has the potential to store 4000 pounds of chlorine in two (2) one ton cylinders. The facility utilizes only one cylinder at a time until the container is empty, at which time the lines are disconnected and connected to the full container. The facility orders a new cylinder when the container in use shows 1000 pounds. Under this chemical management system, the volume of chlorine on site is generally under the threshold of 2500 pounds.\n\n\n\nThis plan contains all of the elements required for program 3 facilities under the Clean Air Act section 112(r) regulations including maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the potential hazard zone under both the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario. These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario that would require either evacuation of the area or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place.\n\n\n\nVWNA takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine gases that could affect their employees, nearby businesses, and the public. The facility operates under a current OSHA Process Safety Management Plan which details both the dangers associated with using chlorine and the precautions implemented to ensure the safe use of chlorine in the disinfection process of treating the wastewater for discharge. Precautions include routine inspection of the equipment, proper stock of emergency response and personal protection equipment, and training of facility personnel on proper operating and emergency response procedures. The most probable type of release may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine lines. VWNA has trai"

VWNA keeps a chlorine A?BA? kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on operational leaks. Any Emergency Response is to be done in conjunction with the Freeport Fire Department and Chemical Emergency Response Contractors (C.A.R.E.) contracted by the Fire Department. All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the likely types of leaks are available on site.
