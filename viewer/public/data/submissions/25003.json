      "SummaryText": "The Brush Creek Facility consists of one 12000 gallon propane tank that will have natural gas liquids in it.\nThe exact composition of the liquids will vary depending on production from 8 wells that feed the facility.\nWe chose propane as it will probably be the dominant liquid in the tank at any one time. The facility will be unmanned. A contract employee will be at the facility an average of 5 times per week to make sure it is operating properly.Warning and keep out signs will be posted.\n   The basic safety and response program will be to shut the gas wells in that feed the facility if a release or fire should ever occur. If anyone is in the vacinity, they will be alerted to the potential danger. The closest residents, which are more than 0.4 miles away will also be notified. Next, the local fire department will be notified.(The worst case scenario for flammable liquids has a calculated endpoint of 0.3 miles for 50,000 pounds of propane according to tables in chapter 5 of an RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis document.)\n    The Brush Creek Facility is also permitted thru, and is in compliance wiith the strict rules and regulations of the Colorado Oil & Gas Commission and the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment Air Quality Division. There have been no accidental releases or injuries at this facility in the past five years. Also available, either at this facility or with contract employees are fire extinguishers, hydrocarbon leak detectors, and necessary hand tools to repair faulty equipment. Valves and piping are visually inspected by contract employees every time they are on location. Valves are turned at least every 2 months and lubricated, repaired or replaced as required to insure proper operation. The hydrocarbon leak detector is used at least every 2 months to check for leaks. Fences and earthen berms are in place to help prevent accidental contact of critical controls by trucks or livestock.\n    This facility is located on private pro"
