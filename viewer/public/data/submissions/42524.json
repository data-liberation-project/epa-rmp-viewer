The Big Goose Plant is administered, operated, and maintained, under contract, by the City of Sheridan.\n\nThe Big Goose Water Plant is located approximately 13.5 miles west of Sheridan. It is standard surface water plant utilizing coaulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Chlorine, a regulated substance, is added to the final product for disinfection.\n\nChlorine from one ton containers is usedd, with a maximum storage of 10,000 pounds. The chlorination system consists of two gas, vacuum operated, ton mounted chlorinators, one in service and the other on stand-by. The chlorinators will discontinue the flow of chlorine gas shoould the operating vacuum be lost. When the in-service container is empty, a vacuumm type automatic switchover module will automaticly transfer to the stand-by container to allow for continuous chlorination. Two rotometers control the rate of chlorine gas flow. The ejector supplies the vacuum needed  for the system to operate and eject chlorine gas into the supply water, making a chlorine solution. Also, in the event of a chlorine release, a one ton chlorine scrubber would activate and prevent the release of chlorine from the building.\n\nFor accidential release prevention, there is a fully operational and enforced Process Safety Management program, operating personnel perform daily inspection of chlorination equipment and the chlorine storage area, scheduled maintenance, in house and off site training. Inspection of chlorine containers prior to acceptance and unloading. Aminimum of one drill may be conducted annually with the Hazardous material Response Team and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Coodinator.\n\nFor emergency response, personnel will evacuate the plant; 911 Emergency  Services will be notified by the chlorine release alar"

The HazMat Team is in charge of and responsible for all activities involving a chlorine release. Public notification of a chlorine release will be given at the discretion of the Incident Commander.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the total release of a one on container (2,000 Pounds) of chlorine at 33.3 pounds per second  for a one minute duration; the end point distance (MaxThreat Zone) would be 1.2 miles. The alternate case release scenario I the release of a one ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine at 161 pounds per minute for a thirteen minute duration; the end point distanc (Max Threat Zone) would be 1.0 miles.\n\nThe Big Goose Water Treatment Plant has not had a chlorine release and has no accidennt history."
