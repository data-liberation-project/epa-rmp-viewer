The emergency response policy is to determine the nature of the release, and if it is severe enough to call 911 and notify HAZMAT and wait for them to respond, if it is a minor leak plant personnel will repair the leak themselves.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source consists of five (5) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine.\n\n\n\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program for the facility is based on HAZWOPER guidelines.  All operators and maintenance personnel are properly trained in how to handle emergencies related to a release of chlorine. Some changes that have been planned to improve safety is labeling all process equipment that contain chlorine."
