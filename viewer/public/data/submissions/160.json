Location\n\n1. Facility Policy:\nThe management, and employees of Schuyler Cooperative Assoc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the company is prepared to coordinate with the local fire department and other local officials, to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\nThe primary operation at this facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farmers for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at this location would be 180,000 lbs. in the two storage tanks, which hold 26000 gallons and 11,800 gallons.  This would also be the maximum quantity handled while loading our nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario:\n\nA. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tanks, released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 180,000 lbs., which represents the volume of our two storage tanks at 85% capacity as limited by design.   The distance to the endpoint  (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.21 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release from a failure in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .5 mile.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program:\n\nOur Schuyler facility has implanted the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.11, Storage and handl"

There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that :\n\n7 has caused death, injury, or property damage at our facility.\n7 Or to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths , injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental change. \n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\n\nOur Facility has:\n\nA. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information, as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nC. Our facility employees recognize and are able to contain a spill, and notify the right people to clean up a spill in accordance with level 1 and level 2 of OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are done to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  We hold safety meetings, and are continually trying to educate our employees on the importance of safety, and a safe working environment.  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
