It is the policy of MAAP/W to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion, fire, and/or a release of natural gasoline denaturant and aqueous ammonia while also minimizing the potential impacts to employees, the public, and the environment in the unlikely event of a release.  \n\n\n\nMAAP/W plans to accomplish these objectives with the implementation of the prevention program. The prevention program for MAAP/W includes utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate employee training, contractor evaluation and training, and coordinated response activities and communication with local emergency responders.  MAAP/W considers accidental release prevention when changes are made to any covered process, when contractors are used onsite, or when changes in procedures take place. \n\n\n\nB. MAAP/W is a dry mill ethanol plant that processes corn into value added products such as fuel grade ethanol and high protein animal feed in Madrid, Nebraska.  MAAP/W uses a fermentation process to produce ethanol.  In this updated Risk Management Plan, MAAP/W has included programs for denaturant and aqueous ammonia storage and use.  Natural gasoline (natural gas liquids) is used denature the alcohol product, to make it un-fit for human consumption.  The natural gasoline contains a mixture of regulated flammable substances at concentrations greater than one percent including pentane (20%) and isopentane (18%).  Aqueous ammonia (27% concentration) is used for pH adjustment and as a nutrient (reactant) to aid the fermentation process.  \n\n\n\nC. An off-site consequence analysis for denaturant and aqueous ammonia storage and use was conducted for MAAP/W using RMP*Comp in accordance with the requirements in 40 CFR 68.  The denaturant process analysis included both an unlikely"

The aqueous ammonia analysis included both an unlikely Worst-Case Scenario toxic liquid release of the entire storage tank and a more realistic Alternative Release Scenario during delivery of aqueous ammonia and release of the entire contents of the delivery vehicle. MAAP/W will maintain a copy of this RMP, along with all of the worst-case scenario information at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe key concepts in MAAP/W's prevention program are the elements of their OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  MAAP/W's RMP process are not covered processes under their PSM program.  However, MAAP/W does utilize its PSM program in order to meet the requirements of the RMP program. \n\n\n\nD. During the past five (5) years, MAAP/W reports that there have been no releases or accidents involving RMP covered chemicals resulting in onsite injury or property damage, or off-site injury, property, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nE. Emergency response at MAAP/W is coordinated with MAAP/W personal and the local fire department so that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures will be implemented.  \n\nIn the event of an actual emergency at MAAP/W, local emergency responders have been familiarized with the site and aqueous ammonia and denaturant processes.  This was done to alert and help prepare emergency responders for a worst-case denaturant or aqueous ammonia release scenario.  The RMP can be referenced so that emergency responders will have the knowledge of which population and environmental receptors can be affected by an accidental release. \n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been written for the site that includes responsible parties, communication, and evacuation protocols"

      "SummaryText": ". The facility maintains emergency action plans to deal with prevention and response to accidental releases of hazardous materials. \n\n\n\nF. MAAP/W will continue to evaluate and implement changes when necessary to improve safety and minimize risk at the MAAP/W Facility.  A RMP review and update will be conducted every five (5) years and whenever there is a change in the process design, construction, operations, or maintenance which may affect the potential for a release.  This review and update process will assist the governing agencies and local emergency response agencies in making accurate decisions to protect the public.  A copy of the RMP update will be provided to the governing agencies within six (6) months of any changes made. \n\n\n\nWhen a previously unlisted substance becomes regulated by the EPA, facilities are given three (3) years to update their RMP to reflect their use of this substance.  If MAAP/W discovers that one or more of their processes falls under a listing that was previously unregulated by the EPA, they will update their RMP within three years of this change. \n\n\n\nIf a new process is added by MAAP/W that contains a regulated substance in exceedance of the 40 CFR Part 68 thresholds, MAAP/W will update the RMP on or before the date that the regulated substance is brought on site. Changes to activities and covered process will be communicated with affected employees, affected contractors, and local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nFinally, if the emergency contact information changes, MAAP/W will update the RMP with the corrected information within 30 days.\n\n"
