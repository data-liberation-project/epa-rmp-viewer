This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our in-house First Responders are trained to take defensive action in correcting, minimizing and mitigating emergency situations. For emergency situations, we are also coordinated with the Red Springs Fire Department which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u0092s primary activities revolve around meat processing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA \u0093RMP*COMP\u0094 as well as the EPA \u0093Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u0094.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.

The analysis is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n- Operating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, John Soules Foods, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the process.\n\n- Training\nJohn Soules Foods, Inc. has a training program in place to train employees who are operating the process or are associated with the process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\nJohn Soules Foods, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and compressors.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a background in maintenance practices.  Training is provided to the personnel as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n- Compliance Audits\nJohn Soules Foods, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n- Incident Investigation\nJohn Soules Foods, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n- Employee Participation\nJohn Soules Foods, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility\u0092s compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n- Contractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
