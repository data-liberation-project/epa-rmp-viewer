INTRODUCTION\nThe regulations governing the Risk Management Plan were compiled to help prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, flammable or explosive chemicals.\n\nThe chemical used by Suisun-Solano Water Authority (SSWA) which is regulated by this standard is Sodium Hypochlorite(SH).  Sodium Hypochlorite is stored at the Cement Hill Water Treatment Plant and is used for the treatment of public drinking water for the city of Suisun.\n\nIt is the intent of the SSWA to comply with the regulations pertaining to management of acutely hazardous materials.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle SH, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\nII.

SSWA has concluded that SH leaks are the hazard involved in the chlorination process.  The following addresses the hazards of the chlorination process, the engineering and administrative controls applicable to Sodium Hypochlorite leaks and their relationships, consequences of failure of those controls, and the consequences of the effects on all workplace employees in or near the process area.\n1. Chemical Release\na) Continuous Release:\nSH can be released from a point source over a period.  An example of such a release is a leak through a line break or injection point connection.  Such a leak will get worse until the condition is corrected but the pumping system will alarm with no flow scenario and alert operations. I n addition secondary containment will collect all capacity of tank volume is scenario of a leak after pumping system,\n2. Hazards to Health\na) General\nSodium Hypochlorite is primarily a skin & eye irritant.\nb) Acute Toxicity\nLiquid chlorine in contact with the eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.  All symptoms and signs result directly or indirectly from its direct irritation action.  There are no known systemic effects.\n1) Vegetation:\nLiquid Chlorine causes bleach spots on leafy plants due to attack on chlorophyll in the leaf.  Mature leaves are most susceptible to chlorine injury.  Usually the plant itself is not destroyed although yield or growth rate may be retarded.\n2) Anim"

Administrative Controls:\na) All employees will be properly trained in accordance with the training outlined in this document.  The training is cross-referenced with SSWA's IIPP.  The training outlines leak control procedures as well as emergency measures in the event of a leak.\nb) All employees who perform work operations around the chlorine storage areas, including but not limited to taking delivery storage containers, will be equipped with and trained to use the proper protective equipment.\nD. Operating Procedures\n1. Taking delivery of Sodium hypochlorite form DELIVERY TRUCK\n1) One operator will be present, in addition to delivery person, to work on all loading and unloading of Sodium Hypochlorite.\n2) Make sure you have available all necessary PPE.\n3) Collect bill of lading and ensure correct chemical is being delivered.\n4) Help delivery person connect hose to delivery pipeline and supervise entire delivery periodically.\n2. LEAKS -MINOR AND MAJOR\n1) If major leak occurs, refer to Emergency Response Procedures.\n2) If minor leak occurs, notify support and supervising personnel and secure leak.\nE. Training\nSafe handling of SH depends upon the effectiveness of employee training, proper safety instructions, intelligent supervision, and the use of suitable equipment.  It is the responsibility of supervisors to train employees how to use personal protective and other safety equipment.  It is the responsibility of employees to properly use the equipment provided.  Training classes will be conducted to maintain a high degree of competence in handling procedures.  Employees will be informed of the hazards that may result from improper handling of chlorine.  They will be trained to prevent leaks and instructed regarding proper a"
