      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nA) Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nKaiser-Frontier Midstream, LLC's (Kaiser-Frontier) Silo Gas Plant is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, procedures are in place to secure the facility and notify the appropriate response personnel.  In addition to the facility's Emergency Action Plan, the Silo Gas Plant is included in the community response plan maintained by the Laramie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\n\n\n\nB) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Silo Gas Plant is located 15 miles northeast of Cheyenne, Wyoming approximately 1 mile south of the intersection of County Road 222 and 136.  It incorporates a variety of equipment to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, propane, butane, pentane, etc.) from oil and gas wells.  The Silo Plant handles methane, ethane, propane, pentane and butane which are regulated flammable substances.  It produces approximately 0.5 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nThe maximum on-site inventory of natural gas liquids is operationally limited to approximately 90,000 gallons or 375,000 pounds.  Currently there are three (3) storage bullet tanks at the facility with approximately 125,000 pounds of storage capacity each.  Only two of these are in service at any one time, with the third providing back up storage capacity should the primary vessel need to be removed from service.\n\n\n\nThe Silo Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nC) General Accident Release Prevention Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Silo Gas Plant.  The process is regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  This summary addresses only general safety issues and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n1) Safe Work Practices\n\n\n\na) A lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on\n\n\n\nb) A procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened\n\n\n\nc) A permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work)\n\n\n\nd)A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\n\n\nThese procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n2) Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nKaiser-Frontier's Silo Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or similar incident.  The investigator documents his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to Kaiser-Frontier management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\n\n\n\n3) Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Kaiser-Frontier periodically conducts audits to determ"

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\n4) Summary of Process Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe process at the Silo Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.  The Silo Gas Plant has safety features to help 1) quickly detect a release, 2) contain/control a release and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the convered process:\n\n\n\na) Release detection\n\n\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors and alarms\n\n\n\nb) Release containment/control\n\n\n\n1. Vlaves to permit isolation of the process\n\n\n\n2. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high temperature, high pressure)\n\n\n\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n\n\n4. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nc) Release Mitigation\n\n\n\n1. Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\n2. Spacing of equipment in accordance with Industrial Risk Insurer's spacing guideline\n\n\n\n3. Emergency shutdowns strategically placed in the plant to automatically shut in the inlet.\n\n\n\nD) Off-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest storage vessel containing approximately 125,000 pounds of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) mixture.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was calculated using the RMP*Comp program to be 0.4 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario associated wi"

The LEPC response plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  In addition, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan for the site which describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment and provides the contact information for emergency response organizations.  A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals are kept at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes to the facility and the covered process, and the employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Silo Gas Plant is coordinated with the Laramie County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Silo Gas Plant Manager has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilita"
