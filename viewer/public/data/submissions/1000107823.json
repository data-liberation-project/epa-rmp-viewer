In addition, the Manual addresses the facility's actions as a non-responding site to address the Emergency Response requirements of 40 CFR 68.90.\n\n<>The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe Overbeck facility has had no RMP reportable incident in the previous five years. \n\n<>The emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nIn the event of an emergency, facility employees will notify the local emergency responders identified in the Emergency Action Plan to respond and will evacuate when needed.  Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan that is included in Section 4 of the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual.\n\n<>Planned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe facility completed an update to the process hazard analysis in September of 2022 that documented the actions taken on recommendations for enhanced process safety from the previous PHA reports."

KC Midstream is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Catalyst Energy, Inc. (Catalyst Energy).\n\n<>The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual, which details the RMP program requirements as well as how KC Midstream complies with the applicable requirements.  The Overbeck facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n<>The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Overbeck facility is located in Sigel, Elk County, Pennsylvania.  The facility compresses and processes natural gas to produce pipeline quality natural gas and NGLs.  The natural gas and NGL mixture is comprised of a flammable mixture containing the following regulated substances:\n\n \tButane [106-97-8];\n \tEthane [74-84-0];\n \tIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] [75-28-5];\n \tIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-] [78-78-4];\n \tMethane [74-82-8];\n \tPentane [109-66-0]; and \n \tPropane [74-98-6].  \n\n<>The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Overbeck facility is not required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations because they are eligible for RMP Program Level 1. However, the Overbeck facility is required to comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified under the Process Safety Manag"
