      "SummaryText": "In response to growing public concern over the potential danger from accidental releases of hazardous substances, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was mandated by Section 112(r)(7) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment.  By adding Section 112(r), which was part of a Congress response to a series of past chemical accidents with major off-site consequences, the CAAA established a new role for the EPA in chemical accident prevention.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was prepared to fulfill the requirements of Section 112(r) of the CAAA pursuant to USEPA regulations contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, Sections 68.1-68.220, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions. These regulations require stationary sources with listed substances present in a process in greater than the threshold quantity to develop and implement a RMP that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. The RMP must be registered with the USEPA, submitted to appropriate agencies, and made available to the public.  In 1999, this RMP was originally prepared by Quentin L. Hampton Associates and updated in 2004 and 2009 by Seavy & Associates, Inc. (S&A) on behalf of City of Largo Environmental Services Department.  For 2014, City staff is performing the plan resubmission following an external compliance audit, which was performed on August 20, 2014 by Seavy & Associates, Inc.  \n\n\n\nIt is pertinent to begin by distinguishing between the Risk Management Program and the Risk Management Plan.  The Plan is the information that the owner or operator will prepare and submit to a central point to be specified by the EPA.  The Program is the system that backs up the Plan and confirms that the facility is being operated safely.\n\n\n\nThe City of Largo Environmental Services Department has establi"

The program is designed to provide reasonable assurance that operation hazards are identified, significant safety incidents are avoided, operational safety requirements are considered in making decisions, proper maintenance/inspections are performed, unacceptable risks to person, property, products and environment are avoided, and emergency response resources are available and ready in the event of a chemical incident. \n\n\n\nLet it be noted that the City of Largo is in the final design stages for eliminating chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas, and will be switching to less hazardous chemicals; specifically, Sodium Hypochlorite (12% liquid bleach), liquid Sodium Bisulfite, and 12 to 15% Peracetic Acid.  The construction project is scheduled to commence early in calendar year 2015.\n\n\n\nThe City of Largo Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WWRF) is an advanced wastewater treatment facility that is currently permitted by Florida Department of Environmental Protection to treat eighteen (18) million gallons of wastewater per day on an annual average.  It is located in Pinellas County at 5000 150th Avenue North, Clearwater, Florida.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are regulated hazardous substances, are stored and used at the City of Largo WWRF.  The hazardous properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling the substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to facility personal and contractors, and to reduce the threat to the community.  At the WWRF, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored and used in greater than the EPA threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs for chlorine and 5,000 pounds for sulfur dioxide. The wastewater treatment operation utilizes chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide gas for chlorination (di"

Buildings at the WWRF limit the on site quantities to a maximum inventory of 40,000 pounds of chlorine in twenty (20) one-ton cylinders and a maximum inventory of 28,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in sixteen (16) one-ton cylinders.  Both substances are gaseous at ambient conditions and are stored liquefied in pressurized cylinders.  The cylinders are delivered to the facility and unloaded by the chemical supply vendor.  The cylinders are connected/disconnected by the facility's trained operating personnel.  Liquefied or gaseous chlorine or sulfur dioxide may pose a health risk if the valves, containers, or lines transferring the material develop leaks or rupture.  The quantity released, release rate, weather conditions, and topography will affect the speed and direction of spread of the gas.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. Mitigation measures include the placement of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems within enclosed structures. Both processes are locally monitored using continuous gas monitors connected to local and remote alarm systems. Operations and maintenance staff are properly trained on process safety procedures. Based on a review of the applicable regulations and considering the City of Largo WWRF compliance approach, Prevention Program 3 has been selected for the WWRF.  The main focus of the prevention program is to reduce the likelihood of a release by properly maintaining equipment and training staff and contractors.\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there has been no reportable chemical release at the facility. \n\n\n\nThis written RMP was developed based upon the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system design information, operating procedures and other relevant facility information.

A review of the system accident history and the facility Emergency Response Plan (ERP) was also conducted.  If a release does occur, the ERP will be a key component of post-release mitigation efforts. A hazard assessment consisting of one worst-case and two alternate case release scenarios was completed and both hazard and vulnerable zones were identified.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 68 regulations, guidance provided by the USEPA RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) document and EPA's OCA software package RMP*COMP.  An updated RMP, including an updated off-site consequence analysis, prevention programs, and management system, will be submitted within five years of this RMP re-submission or the most recent RMP update.  A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations will be conducted at least every three years.  A management system is in place to address and implement recommendations related to these hazards."
