Accidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this Western Farm Service facility are committed to the prevention of any release of chemical handled at the facility.  If a release should occur, this facility is prepared to work with the local hazardous material team, the local fire department, the local administering agency and our emergency response contractor to control, contain and clean up the release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and sale of liquid and dry fertilizers and pre-packaged and bulk agricultural chemicals to growers and ranchers.\n\nThis facility stores and handles two regulated chemicals - Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.  It is also used at the facility for the production of Aqua Ammonia and Ammonium Polyphosphate (an unregulated fertilizer).\n\nAqua Ammonia is produced and stored at the facility.  It is used for direct field application by growers as a fertilizer.  \n\nAmmonium Polyphosphate is produced and stored at the facility.  It is used for direct field application by growers as fertilizer.\n\n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThis facility prepared a worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  These are not included as recommended by EPA.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility operates in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n-- National Electrical Code\n-- Uniform Fire Code\n-- Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, ANSI K 61.1, 1989, American National Standards Institute, Inc.\n-- Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Subchapter 1, Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\n-- Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\n-- Title 29, CFR 1920.38, Employee Emergency Response Plan and Fire Prevention Plans\n-- Title 29, CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Op"

Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia or Aqua Ammonia at this facility during the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has prepared and implemented an emergency response plan that meets state and federal regulations.  The emergency response plan specifies the lines of authority and the roles and responsibilities individuals are to assume during an emergency.  The emergency response plan includes procedures to follow for fires, explosions, medical emergencies, spills, releases and natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding.\n \n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at this facility.  Improvements to existing safety procedures and practices are determined through inspections and audits that are conducted periodically."
