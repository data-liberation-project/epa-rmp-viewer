      "SummaryText": "1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Clearwater Paper Corporation operates Cypress Bend Mill (Clearwater) and has a long-standing commitment to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division in McGehee, Arkansas, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility. One component of this system is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Clearwater and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan Rule (the Rule).  One of the requirements of the Rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at Clearwater. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Clearwater.\n\n\n\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nClearwater is an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 365 full-time workers. Clearwater produces approximately 950 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates a coated paperboard machine.  To support these operations, Clearwater handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Rule: chlorine and chlorine dioxide. \n\n\n\nThe Rule requires all regulated toxic substances contained in 40 CFR 68 that are stored in quantities above the specified thresholds to be included in an RMP. Chlorine is present in pressurized containers above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds at three distinct locations and chlorine dioxide is present in a chilled aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds.  The regulated use of these substances at Clearwater is summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Clearwater does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that both might occur at a facility similar to Clearwater and would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. By identifying these potential releases, Clearwater has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.  The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard Assessment Documentation section of the RMP.\n\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (PROGRAM 3)\n\n\n\nSince Clearwater's inception in 1977, the mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, Clearwater formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health "

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that only contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks are hired. Clearwater trains the contract supervisors in the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, in Clearwater safe work practices, and in mill emergency response procedures. Clearwater requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the site. Clearwater periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed. \n\n\n\n5.0  CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Clearwater has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the mill. \n\n?    Chlorine specific release prevention is the use of the one-ton cylinders in water treatment in all chlorine processes located at various locations around Clearwater. These cylinders provide passive security against potential releases. \n\n?    Chlorine dioxide is produced at Clearwater and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column where a maximum of 1.5% by weight chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release. A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n\n\n6.0  FI"

The employee was changing out an empty chlorine cylinder and was exposed to chlorine gas trapped in the vaporizer/chlorinator assembly.  First aid was administered as needed.  The procedure was reviewed for clarity and refresher training was held on leak detection, scenarios for potential gas release, and past history of gas release and mechanical failures.\n\n\n\nThe second incident occurred on May 2, 2021 and lasted for 29 hours.  Due to a control valve failure in the chlorine dioxide delivery system, excess chlorine dioxide was charged to the process.  It was determined that the safest alternative to remedy the immediate issue was to allow the extra chlorine dioxide gas to off in the washer hoods and into the bleach plant scrubber.  The employee completed sampling in the affected area while chlorine sensors were not sounding an alarm without use of a respirator.  The procedure was reviewed resulting in the establishment of a new PM for the problem part. Chlorine alarms were also revised so that monitors on the operate floor sound at 0.5 ppm rather than 1 ppm.
