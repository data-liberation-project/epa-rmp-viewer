      "SummaryText": "MENDOTA GAS PLANT - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Mendota Gas Plant has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Mendota Gas Plant, located in Roberts County in the Texas Panhandle, extracts natural gas liquids from natural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of ethane, propane and butane. Some of the chemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, and butane. The entire Mendota Gas Plant is considered a single process. Based on the criteria in the Accidental Release Program, the Mendota Gas Plant is a Program Level 1 process.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere is more than the EPA Threshold Quantity of propane at the Mendota Gas Plant. The EPA Threshold Quantity for all flammables is set at 10,000 pounds. The threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical, which if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations. \n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include propane and a mixed natural gas liquids stream (consisting primarily of ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes). The worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable materials is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a 30,000 gallon storage tank containing natural gas liquids (assumed to be propane). The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable liquid mixture was calculated and d"

Thus, there was not an analysis of the worst-case scenario for a release of toxic substances.\n\nSince this is a Program Level 1 process, there is not a requirement to complete an alternative release scenario for the flammable substances.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n1. The Mendota Gas Plant will have a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based on the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. While the Program Level 1 processes do not require a specific prevention program, the Mendota Gas Plant follows the OSHA PSM guidelines.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Mendota Gas Plant has not had an incident over the past five years which has impacted off-site people or structures.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Mendota Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety. The Mendota Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies, as required in 40CFR 68.12(b)(3).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Mendota Gas Plant has a very strong prevention program in place. However, the facility continually looks for improvements, both to the process and to safety issues at the facility. We have a very strong commitment to the safety of our employees and to the community around our facilities."
