The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Truman Farmers Elevator Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients..\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 380,000 pounds in our 18,000 and 12,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst case scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 80,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity  as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .94 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the"

The Five-year Accident History.\n\na.  There has been one accidental release that happened on 7/18/1998 during a thunderstorm that caused a fertilizer leg to blow over on top of our 18,000 gallon storage tank.  The impact apparently rocked the tank loosening the liquid piping that enters the valve on the belly of the tank.  Initially, the fire department responded, and as a precaution, evacuated some nearby houses, and notified other nearby residents of the accident and sheltered in place.  The fire department created a 'tank' around the leaking joint from a tarp and soil, which reduced the amount of vapor escaping from the site.  After our employees arrived, it was determined that the valve was functioning properly, and the product escaping was only that which was in the pipe, the employees were able to bleed the remainder of the product in the pipe into the bleed-off tank.  It is estimated that there could have been a maximum of 110 gallons in the piping, most of which was bled off into the bleed-off tank.\n\n6.  The emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\nc.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
