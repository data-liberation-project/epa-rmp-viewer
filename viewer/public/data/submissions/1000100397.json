We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including: \r\nA.\tDescription of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\nB.\tOverview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\nC.\tFive-year accident history for accidental releases\r\nD.\tOverview of our emergency response program\r\nE.\tOverview of planned changes to improve safety \r\nF.\tSupplemental information regarding our RMP data elements\r\n\r\nThis RMP is being submitted as an initial submittal prior to the start up of the process\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nSunoco, LLC the owner/operator of the Brownsville Terminal, an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Brownsville, TX. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel, ethanol, butane, and various other petroleum-based additives. \r\nThe primary function of the Terminal is to act as a refined storage and distribution terminal.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with Butane (C4), it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. The terminal is located at 9351 Old Texas 48, Brownsville, TX 78521 with the approximate vessel coordinates at 25.959799\u00b0"

Based on the PSM coverage of the Terminal, the terminal has a Program 3 RMP.\r\n\r\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM The centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the unit Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit. These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems. In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n General Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\r\n -Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\r\n -Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.). \r\n-Updated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\r\n -Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained operators.\r\n -Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\r\n -Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\r\n -Scheduled inspection and t"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \r\nThis is a new facility and is being started up. There have been no accidents or releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE ROGRAM \r\nThe Facility maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and SARA Title III. Our emergency response program is reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required. Our program provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The program includes written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. \r\nThese emergencies include airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies. \r\nThe programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\r\n -Information on the terminal emergency organization (Incident Command System).\r\n -Information on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding"
