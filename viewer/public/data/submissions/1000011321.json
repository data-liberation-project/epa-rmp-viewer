      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nFirstEnergy Sammis Plant\nRMP Plan\n\nBackground\n\nFirstEnergy generates electricity at the Sammis power plant in Stratton, Ohio.  In order to reduce NOx air emissions, Sammis is installing a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on units 6&7.  This system removes NOx by catalytically reacting NOx with Ammonia to form Nitrogen and water vapor.  The process is covered by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rules due to the presence of 29 % Aqueous Ammonia.\n\nThe covered process includes:  rail car unloading, tank truck unloading, storage, and SCR feed.  There are six storage tanks that may contain up to 57,000 gallons each (95% capacity).  There is also an emergency truck unloading and feed station.\n \nOverview of the RMP Prevention Program \n\nThe Sammis process is considered a Program 2 site by RMP rules.  However, FirstEnergy has chosen to implement additional elements of a Program 3 site.  Sammis uses a management of change and pre-startup safety review procedure as well conducting a compliance audit every three years following EPA guidelines.\n\nProcess protections are primarily those measures that will reduce, prevent or minimize a release from happening or, if it did happen, minimize the consequences of that threat.    These include:\n\nA?    Training on operations, emergencies etc;\n-Operators of the systems covered by the RMP plan have refresher training at least every 3 years.\nA?    Regular maintenance/SOPS;        \nA?    During deliveries, attendance by the operator is continuous until the delivery is complete;\nA?    No rail cars or tank trucks stored on site other than those in the process of being unloaded;\nA?    Onsite wireless communication;\nA?    Onsite trucks/vehicles for emergency transportation needs;   \nA?    Fire extinguishers; \nA?    Ammonia monitors/detectors/alarms;\nA?    Main feed pump flow alarms/detector\nA?    High level tank alarms with interlock shutoffs  \nA?    Secondary containment;         \n-Underground vault large enough to contain the largest release and"

Water cannon and service water hydrants (knock down Ammonia fumes);\nA?    Incident investigation procedures; \n\nThese are the major site security measures:\n\nA?    Fence with barbed wire surrounding the site\nA?    Security camera(s) in selected areas\nA?    Main entrance staffed with guards on a 24 hour basis.\nA?    All other gates are either locked or guarded but may be opened in the event of emergency egress.\nA?    Warning signs\n\nIt is the policy of FirstEnergy to assure the safe operation of the facility which is designed and built to good engineering practices that incorporate methods or principles in accordance with applicable industry standards.  Some of these standards include ASME code for process piping, B31.3, and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel code, Section VIII.   \n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no accidents.  This is a new installation.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThere is a written emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County LEPC and the local fire departments.  Selected site response personnel are Hazwoper trained.    \n\nEmergency response planning has long been an integral part of operations at Sammis.  Regulations under OSHA, EPA, Coast Guard, and Ohio EPA have required the site to develop and implement procedures to plan for and respond to emergency situations at the plant whether due to natural disasters, storms, exposure to releases or harm/damage resulting from potentially flammable or explosive materials.  \n\n"
