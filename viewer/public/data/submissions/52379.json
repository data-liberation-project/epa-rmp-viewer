The extruded product is in sheet form. This sheet is converted into various products.\n\n\tDifluoroethane and Isopentane are delivered to R L Adams Plastics via tanker truck. The driver has to sign in and be approved for delivery. The Difluoroethane and Isopentane are unloaded using a truck mounted pump to the aboveground tank with maximum quantity of 45,000 lbs. and 56000 lbs. (respectively) in a secured tank farm using a vapor recovery system that prevents the release of vapors. The truck is bonded to the earth ground to prevent sparks. The driver must be qualified and trained in the safe handling of this product. The driver must be with the truck continuously throughout the unloading procedure. \n\n\t1.\t R.L. Adams Plastics Inc. works closely with the City of Wyoming Fire Department for the process information and updates of changes. The Wyoming Fire Department is our first responder.\n\n\t2. \tR.L. Adams Plastics Inc. insures the safe handling of Difluoroethane and Isopentane using various procedures. (Including but not limited to)\n\t\n\t\tA. Training for the safe practices of Difluoroethane and Isopentane, this includes all new employees, also annual reviews with all employees, and updates on a continuing basis.\n  \n\t\tB.
