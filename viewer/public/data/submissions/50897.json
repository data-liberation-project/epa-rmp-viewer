These tanks are above ground and surrounded by a dike to contain any spills around the tanks or the unloading area.  These tanks are regularly inspected, inside and out.  The walls of the metal tanks are routinely tested for integrity.  The tank and unloading areas are also protected by a water deluge system that discharges water automatically if it senses heat.  The water system can also be activated manually at the site or from a remote location in the event of an incident.  Fire fighting nozzles also are located around the tanks and can deliver high volumes of water into the storage area.  Employees monitor the area via video cameras.  The total volume of all three tanks is always less than 2/3 of the maximum capacity to allow room to transfer material out of one tank to the other two in the event of a problem with one tank.  Because of the flammable nature of dimethylamine, all equipment in the area is electrically classified for use in an explosive environment and grounded against static discharge.  The dimethylamine used to manufacture detergents is completely consumed in chemical reactions during the process.\n\nBromine comes to the Kansas City plant in dedicated trucks and is unloaded into a single tank.  The tank is located in an enclosed, covered spill-containment area that is below grade.  The unloading area also is protected against spills.  This tank is externally inspected every year and internally inspected every two years.  The tank is protected by a foam vapor suppression system, and is monitored by video cameras.  When the tank is emptied for maintenance, any vapors remaining are collected in a mist vacuum and scrubber system that neutralizes any remaining bromine.

In an effort to continually improve our systems, Procter & Gamble has an internal process for reviewing all of our safety systems.  This process is called a Key Element Assessment.  The Kansas City Soap Plant is scheduled for its Key Element Assessment (KEA) in April of 2008.    In addition to our  KEA, we are working on completing the following items that were identified as some of our top opportunities for improvement by our Process Hazard Analysis:\n\n1.)\tDetermine the proper startup and shutdown sequence for the burning operation\n\n2.)\tInstall new level transmitters on each DMA storage tank and install a new non-intrusive flow meter on the DMA unload line or a redundant level transmitter on each storage tank.\n\n3.)\tCondu study to evaluate upgrades for electrical installation in Class I, Division 1, Group C area around DMA storage tanks.  \n\n4.)\tInstall new"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nKansas City Soap Plant\n\nWhat We Do\nThe Kansas City Soap Plant of The Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company (P&G) manufactures liquid dish detergents and raw materials for use in our own products and for sale to other companies.  These include \u00bfDawn,\u00bf \u00bfIvory,\u00bf and \u00bfJoy,\u00bf which might be found in a home kitchen.  The Kansas City Kansas P&G plant has been in continuous operation since 1905, and it is the first P&G plant opened outside of Cincinnati, Ohio, our corporate headquarters.\n\nIn Kansas City and elsewhere, P&G has a long-standing commitment to a safe work environment for employees and minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment.  Our safety and environmental programs are managed by highly skilled employees, and actively supported by the participation of all employees and all management, and a strong corporate staff.  The goal of both the safety and environmental programs is prevention.  Procter & Gamble believes in a zero defect work environment where issues are identified and fixed as a part of daily work.  This zero defect mentality leads to continuously improving operations and zero incidents that could harm people or the environment.  Although P&G\u00bfs safety record is already among the best in the business, we are constantly striving for improvement.\n\nThe Kansas City plant has an excellent history of safe operations. Incident and \u00bfnear miss\u00bf reporting is encouraged and rewarded.  Any incidents or near misses on site are followed by a thorough incident investigation and follow-up action steps are taken to prevent recurrence.  Routine inspection as well as detailed analysis using non-destructive test equipment such as boriscopes, ultrasonic thickness instruments, dye penetrant tests, etc. are routinely used to ensure the equipment is at optimal condition at all times.\n\n\nChemicals Used in Kansas City Subject to EPA Report\nP&G\u00bfs Kansas City Soap Plant uses three chemicals that are subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S."

Dikes surround the unloading and tank storage areas, and both locations are grounded.  Neither tank is allowed to be more than half full, which allows the transfer of the contents from one to the other during maintenance or an emergency.  Each tank is inspected externally every year and the integrity of the metal walls is routinely examined.  Both the storage and unloading areas are protected by a foaming deluge system that employees can activate remotely.  Fire fighting monitor nozzles are located around the tanks, as are remote video cameras.  Epichlorohydrin is completely consumed in the manufacturing of detergent.\n\nPrior to July 2001, the site had a fourth chemical subject to RMP requirements, sulfur trioxide.  The surfactant making process that used sulfur trioxide was replaced with a more modern system that eliminated the need to keep that hazardous material at this facility.  In July 2001 the sulfur trioxide system was decommissioned.  \n\nAccident History\nIn the past 5 years there has been one incident involving RMP regulated chemicals.  \nIn April, 2004, a technician was lifting a hose over a fence and the open end of the hose hit him in the face and splashed some liquid solution that may have contained Dimethylamine into his eye.  The technician immediately went to the eye wash station and flushed out his eye.  The technician was later taken to the Kansas University Medical Center and received treatment.  There were no other onsite or offsite impacts from this splash of solution which may have contained dimethylamine.  As a result of this injury, improvements to the process were initiated Since this event there have been no further accidents involving dimethylamine or the other RMP chemicals present onsite.\n\n\n\nHow We Prevent Releases\nThe worst case scenarios studied for the off-site consequence analyses require"

Company engineers and operators identified potential points from which a chemical may be spilled or leaked during the process.  We have used that analysis to design better systems, train operators and maintenance employees and to develop accident prevention and response systems.  \n\nAs described above, each chemical is contained within a tank and piping system appropriate for that service.  Well-trained operators monitor the conditions 24 hours per day, 7 days a week via inspection rounds, video cameras, temperature and pressure gauges, and other instruments.  Volumes in the tanks also are monitored.  Tanks are not refilled unless the arriving truck or rail car can be emptied completely.  This helps prevent overflows and spills.  Control systems of the hazardous processes are monitored and controlled by safety instrumented systems designed to initiate a controlled shut-down if operating parameters go beyond predetermined safe operating ranges.\n\nAs called for in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management system, plant operating systems are repeatedly assessed and improved.  Process technicians, engineers and the site safety teams work together to bring about these improvements.  Some products of this improvement process are the mist vacuum neutralization system and triple redundant safety instrumented system controls.  \n\nIn the event of an incident, the Kansas City plant has systems to respond quickly.  Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis.  Spills or leaks can be noted immediately and reported to control room operators. The plant has a direct line to the Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department for quick reporting of releases.  The fire and police departments have developed procedures to"

Employees participate in safety and environmental teams that have been responsible for an improved workplace.  The plant works actively with the Kansas City, Kansas/Wyandotte County Emergency Management and the Kansas City, Kansas, Fire Department and HazMat Team.  P&G has donated fire-fighting equipment to these organizations and has sponsored their attendance at training seminars.\n\nThe Kansas City Soap Plant has received recognition for its safety and environmental accomplishments including: Recognition of 3 million safe work hours (almost 5 years) - September 2001, Kansas Water Environment Association Pretreatment Compliance Award - 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2004 and Kansas Department of Health and Environment Recognition for Notable Achievement in Pollution Prevention - 1997.  Most recently as part of the American Chemistry Council, we completed a Responsible Care Assessment & have been recommended for certification.\n\n\nConclusion\nP&G has been a part of this community for over 100 years, and takes very seriously its responsibility to manage its Kansas City Soap Plant in a way that protects its employees and surrounding neighbors.  We have completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this plant.  We believe that given our safety record, the many controls instituted to maintain a safe operation, and our commitment to continuous improvement that an incident affecting our employees or the surrounding area is unlikely to happen."
