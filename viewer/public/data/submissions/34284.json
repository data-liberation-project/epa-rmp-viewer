(Kraft) facility in Garland Texas has an excellent record of release prevention for it's anhydrous ammonia refrigeration process (AARP).  The facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders and a complete preventative maintenance program as part of a Computerized Maintenance Management System.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Garland Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nKraft manufactures salad dressings, barbecue sauces, and ready-to-drink beverages at the facility.  The facility NAICS code is 311941, Mayonnaise, Dressing, and other Prepared Sauce Manufacturing.  The facility produces and packages dressings, barbecue sauces, and ready-to-drink beverages for consumer consumption.  The storage and process areas of the facility are, therefore,  refrigerated to preserve the products.\n\nKraft has one 40 CFR 68 (RMP Rule) regulated substance at the facility - anhydrous ammonia (ammonia).  Ammonia is used at the facility to refrigerate raw materials and finished food products and to provide climate control.  The threshold quantity for regulation of ammonia under 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The facility stores and uses 38,000 pounds of ammonia and is, therefore, subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule.\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAmmonia falls under Program 3 of the RMP Rule, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Kraft has developed a compliant PSM program for the ammonia system at the facility, and is, therefore, also in compliance with the Program 3 requirements.\n\nThere are several key aspects of the PSM p"

The facility maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n3. The facility has an aggressive PSM meeting schedule.\n4. Changes to the ammonia system are controlled under the Change Management Process.\n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases of ammonia, as defined by 40 CFR 68.42(a), at the facility in the last ten years.\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nKraft has instituted an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) for the facility that divides employees into various management and response teams.  There are 25 in-plant contacts for emergency response which are listed in the Plan.  There are also back-up personnel available in the event that the primary incident response personnel are not available.  At the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Garland Fire Department (GFD) will be called to provide additional emergency responders and equipment.  For all fire emergencies, GFD will be summoned.  In addition, an ambulance always responds with GFD by City policy.\n\nThe Plan includes information about the frequency and content of employee emergency response training.  Most importantly, the Plan contains specific procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or other ammonia emergency.  These include:\n\nResponse to an accidental discharge of hazardous materials or waste.\nNotification of internal, external, and regulatory agencies.\nAccident prevention measures.\nProcedures to contain and limit the duration of an emergency.\nCountermeasures to be employed during an emergency.\nProcedures to protect emergency responders and other employees\n\nThe Plan also incorporates the facility Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan by reference.  The SPCC Plan includes the location, types, and amounts of oil and chemicals stored on site and details the notification and c"

The most recent example is the addition of an automatic ammonia sensing and shut-off system for the boiler room to be completed in the second quarter of 2004."
