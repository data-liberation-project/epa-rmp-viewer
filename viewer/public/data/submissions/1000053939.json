The PHA identifies the hazards associated with the process, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error, and steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases. The RA analyzes the effects of a worst case release scenario and potential alternate case release scenarios and assigns a risk factor.\r\n\r\nOnce complete, a list of recommendations is developed and reviewed by plant personnel and management. The accepted recommendations are then implemented at the site to further reduce the risk associated with the ammonia system. In addition, an Inherently Safer Technology (IST) review is performed to determine if an alternative system could feasibly mitigate the risks associated with the covered process. Recommendations from the previous PHA/RA have been completed. At this time, no additional changes to the risk/safety programs or technology are anticipated.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility since the plant's construction. The emergency response program includes an emergency response plan and coordination of emergency information and activities with both the IMTT site's emergency response team plus the Bayonne Fire Department. The emergency response plan contains the information and procedures necessary to respond to a release of a hazardous substance at the site. Emergency information includes a list of emergency response personnel, notification requirements, evacuation procedures, and health/first aid data.

The facility is located wholly within the boundaries of the IMTT bulk storage terminal. The land use immediately surrounding the facility is industrial. \r\n\r\nThe facility combusts natural gas in three GE Frame 6 combustion turbines (the stationary source) to generate electricity. Each combustion turbine is equipped with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that utilizes waste heat from the exhaust to convert water to steam. The steam from each HRSG is combined to drive a steam turbine. Electricity is generated at each gas turbine and at the steam turbine. Steam is also generated from 4 auxiliary boilers and piped to IMTT's petroleum storage facility for use in providing heat to IMTT's storage tanks. A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system is located within each HRSG to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from the combustion turbine exhaust gases. Each SCR consists of a catalyst and injection grid within the HRSG. Anhydrous ammonia (the regulated substance) is vaporized and injected through the grid upstream of the catalyst. The ammonia mixes with the exhaust gas through a blower system, and as the exhaust/ammonia mixture passes through the catalyst, NOx emissions are converted to elemental nitrogen and water. Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a liquid in an above ground storage tank built to API 510 standards. It is kept pressurized by ambient radiant heat and/or electric vaporizers \r\n\r\nExisting Risk Management Activities\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system is regulated under New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) - (NJAC 7:31); New Jersey's Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES); New Jersey's Discharges of Petroleum and Other Hazardous Substances regulations (NJAC 7:1E); and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.119).

Operators and maintenance personnel undergo a qualification process which addresses ammonia system operating procedures and/or maintenance procedures along with emergency response training. Compliance audits are conducted on an annual basis. These audits consist of a risk management program (RMP) audit plus a safety review of the ammonia system. The program audit consists of reviewing the risk management program, procedures and documentation to ensure the program is being implemented. The ammonia system safety review consists of an audit of the ammonia system, equipment and operating procedures to ensure that the ammonia system is designed and operated in accordance with the appropriate safety protocols.\r\n\r\nIncident investigation procedures are in place at the facility to investigate events related to the ammonia system plus other events, as necessary. Matters that are investigated are properly documented and recommendations are promptly addressed. Management of change procedures are maintained at the facility and are implemented when there are changes to the ammonia system. Change procedures do not apply to replacement in kind, but do apply to temporary procedures, e.g., emptying the NH3 storage tank for an internal inspection.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage tank undergoes in-service and out-of-service inspections in accordance with API 510 standards by licensed inspectors, monthly safety inspections, and daily inspections. In addition, the ammonia tank is protected by concrete barriers to prevent exposure to traffic in the plant. Ammonia truck deliveries are escorted by plant personnel.
