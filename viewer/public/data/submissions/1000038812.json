Intermediates in the manufacture of the products include nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate solution.  The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia and chlorine.\r\n\r\nIt is CF's policy to prevent accidental releases from the Woodward Plant by effective process safety management programs and procedures that include:  participation by all plant employees in every element of PSM; regular analysis of process hazards utilizing current and accurate process safety information; maintaining current and accurate written operating procedures; providing timely and comprehensive training for all employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment; overseeing the activities of contractors and ensuring that they are trained to perform their job safely; following established pre-startup safety review and management of change procedures to ensure that modifications are adequately evaluated for safety; administering a comprehensive mechanical integrity program to ensure that process equipment is maintained in accordance with good engineering practices and accepted industry standards; investigation of incidents when they occur to promptly correct deficiencies and learn from the experience, and audit the entire PSM program on a regular basis to verify that all elements, procedures, and systems are in place and adequate.  In addition, it is the Woodward Plants policy to maintain a current and accurate written emergency response plan, a system to notify facility neighbors in the event of a release, and to coordinate emergency response planning with local authorities and exercise those plans annually.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\r\nThe Woodward Plant's Toxic Worst Case Scenario involves anhydrous ammonia and has offsite impact"

The distance to the toxic endpoint for ammonia (200 ppm) is estimated to be 0.57 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for ammonia (water solution, greater than 20% ammonia) is seal failure on the Strong Aqua Ammonia Pump resulting in a release of 1592 pounds over a 10 minute period.

The Flammable Worst Case Release Scenario for Syngas (Hydrogen and Methane) is for the release of 8680 pounds of Hydrogen and Methane with an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch at 0.2 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario for Syngas (Hydrogen) involves a 1\" tube failure at E-2222 with a release of 1110 pounds over a 10 minute period.

The release was a result of an overpressure situation in the process (UAN #2 Plant) that casued a pressure relief valve to vent ammonia to the atmosphere.  The release resulted in off-site impact.  A neighbor approximately 1 mile from the plant was forced to shelter in place due to the strong odor of ammonia at his business location.\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 2012 a maintenance technician in our maintenance shop had a solution of approximately 40% ammonia sprayed in his eyes when he opened a ball valve on a pump that had been in prior ammonia solution service.  The ammonia solution that was in the pump had pressured up and was released when he opened the valve.  The technician rinsed his eyes for 15 minutes and was then taken to the eye doctor for an evaluation.  He was prescribed an antibiotic as a precaution to prevent infection.  \r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2013 a maintenance technician was exposed to ammonia vapors while changing a filter from an in-line filter housing device.  The ammonia vapors caused a buring sensation to the employee's throat, lungs, and eyes.  The employee was taken to a doctor for a medical evaluation and was given a prescription inhaler as a precautionary measure.\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 2013 an operations technician was exposed to a solution of ammonia when he was opening a valve and the solution leaked and sprayed from the valve stem packing.  The solution sprayed the employee in the right eye.  After rinsing the eye at the nearest eyewash station the employee was taken to the doctor fo"
