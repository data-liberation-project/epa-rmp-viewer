      "SummaryText": "The Florence Water Production Facility (Florence) is one of three water treatment facilities owned by the Metropolitan Utilities District (District).  Florence, along with the Platte South and Platte West Water Production Plants supply drinking water to the City of Omaha and surrounding communities. Liquid chlorine is used at all these facilities for disinfection.  Chlorine is the only chemical at the District that falls under the RMP rule.\n\nFlorence is located in northeast Omaha adjacent to the Missouri River.  The facility is on a 134-acre parcel with farmland to the east (across the river), and commercial, industrial, and residential to the north, south, and west. All Chlorine System operations are conducted inside the \u0093Chlorine Building\u0094. The building was designed to safely contain and mitigate leaks. The building itself acts as a passive safety feature with its large enclosed interior space that slows the escape of any leaking gas. There are also active safety systems inside the building that continuously monitor the air. This system will automatically shut down chlorination if it detects a leak, activate alarms to notify staff, and start a scrubber system that removes chlorine gas from the air. \n\nThe District also has Emergency Response (ER) plans and procedures in place at all our facilities to bring accidental chlorine leaks under control and protect the safety of the public. District management is committed to the safety of the public, our customers, and our employees. Our ER plan includes active response by properly equipped and Hazmat trained employees working with the local Fire Department Hazmat teams. Safety and training staff support this strong commitment to safety and health.\n\nThe responsibility for implementation of the District's ER plan and the safe operation of our Chlorine systems rests with the Vice President of Water Operations. Alternate program responsibilities are assigned to the Director of Platte South, the Director of Platte West, the D"

Equipment installed to facilitate the chlorination process and facilities to store chlorine are inspected daily during plant staff rounds, and scheduled maintenance is performed to ensure system safety and reliability.\n\nSafety information necessary to ensure the facilities and processes meet or exceed codes, standards, and/or guidelines used in the development and installation of regulated requirements has been compiled and reviewed where appropriate. The safety information includes Chlorine Institute Pamphlets, local building and Fire Codes, National Electric Codes, American National Standards Institute pamphlets, manufacturer guides, and applicable State and Federal safety codes.\n\nHazard reviews of the chlorine storage and chlorination facilities are performed using the WTP Hazard Review Checklist for Chlorine Systems provided in the RMP for the Water Industry published by the American Water Works Association. The review includes evaluations of siting, operation and maintenance, hazard recognition, human factors, container shipment and unloading, piping and appurtenances, and general conditions. Areas identified as potentially deficient are documented, evaluated, and corrected if necessary to mitigate hazards. Using Hazard Reviews, we will continue to monitor for deficiencies and identify opportunities to improve safety.\n\nChlorine System Operating procedures are found or referenced in the District's Chlorine and Ammonia Manual. This manual and its related procedures address normal operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, startup following shutdown, consequences of deviation, steps required to correct or avoid deviation, safety and health considerations, and safety systems.

They are also available electronically through the District\u0092s Document Management System.\n\nTraining includes specific Hazmat training for all Chemical Equipment Mechanics, operating procedural training for all plant employees in their respective areas, and safety, health and awareness training for all Plant employees involved directly with the chlorination process.\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every three years using the checklist provided in the RMP for the Water Industry published by the American Water Works Association. The Vice President of Water Operations and Vice President of Safety and Security conduct follow-up until all deficiencies are corrected. All compliance audits and safety reports are filed in the Compliance Audits section of the RMP.\n\nFlorence has had no incidents in the last five years, but in the event of an incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine, an incident investigation team will be formed. The team investigates and reports the findings, causes, and recommendations to the President of the Metropolitan Utilities District. All resolutions and corrective actions will be documented and retained for five years.\n\nThe Metropolitan Utilities District operates its chlorine systems based on sound industry practice and has invested in the structures, equipment and people needed to mitigate the risk of potential small or large leaks to the health of the public. The management and employees of the District take their responsibilities for public safety seriously and are dedicated to maintaining excellence in it processes and product."
