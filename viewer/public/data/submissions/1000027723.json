Vann, Jr. Power Plant.  Aqueous ammonia is used for selective catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen from the facility's stack emissions.  The following executive summary outlines the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies, source description and regulated substances handled, worst-case and alternative release scenarios, accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps, five-year accident history, emergency response program, and planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe risk management plan also includes the data elements contained within EPA's electronic submittal program, RMPESUBMIT, which is accessed through EPA's Central Data Exchange.  \n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nCommitment to Safety\n\nThe PowerSouth Energy Cooperative (PowerSouth) has implemented a program to operate the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant in a safe manner, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the aqueous ammonia storage and transfer system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, facility personnel, and the environment.  Safe operation depends upon proper unloading and storage of aqueous ammonia, proper handling of the aqueous ammonia transfer system, and inherent safety features in the design of the aqueous ammonia system.  Safety in the storage and handling of aqueous ammonia is achieved through the use of operating procedures and employee training.  \n\n\n\nPowerSouth works with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, and to develop and implement an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant.  The emergency response plan includes procedures"

Vann, Jr. Power Plant is electric power generation by the combustion of natural gas.  The facility was constructed in 2001 and has a generating capacity of approximately 500 megawatts (MW).  \n\n\n\nUse of Regulated Substances\n\nAqueous ammonia is used as a reducing agent to remove emissions of the oxides of nitrogen from the flue gas produced by the facility's natural gas combustion turbines. \n\n\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nThe James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant stores approximately 24,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia for the selective catalytic reduction process.  The concentration of ammonia solution is 29.5 percent by weight.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia\n\nA?    WRS:  The worst-case release scenario is rupture of the aqueous ammonia storage tank resulting in a release of 178,500 pounds of aqueous ammonia solution in 10 minutes.  The plant has installed concrete secondary containment for the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  EPA's RMP*Comp program estimates a release rate of 43.1 pounds per minute from the liquid pool in the secondary containment dike to the atmosphere.\n\nA?    Distance to Endpoint:  Under the-worst-case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP Rule, the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 0.4 miles, beyond which there will be enough dispersion that a hazard to the public will no longer exist.\n\nA?    Population Exposed:  It is estimated based on the United States Census Bureau population density for Covington County that 18 people would be affected within the WRS toxic endpoint circle.\n\nA?    Environmental Receptors:  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to the WRS toxic endpoint for aqueous ammonia.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia \n\nA?    ARS:  The alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure from the transfer lin"

EPA's RMP*Comp program estimates a release rate of 53.9 pounds per minute from the liquid pool in the secondary containment dike to the atmosphere.\n\nA?    Distance to Endpoint:  Under realistic weather conditions of 3.0 m/s wind speed and a wind stability class of \"D,\" aqueous ammonia would travel 0.2 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  \n\nA?    Population Exposed:  It is estimated based on the United States Census Bureau population density for Covington County that 4 people outside the facility would be affected.\n\nA?    Environmental Receptors:  There are no environmental receptors within the ARS toxic endpoint circle.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant has complied with the requirements of the Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all equipment systems, as well as of administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using the HAZOP technique.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nPowerSouth's James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant has never had a release of aqueous ammonia resulting in offsite injury or atmospheric dispersion, or an injury to facility personnel on site.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPowerSouth has coordinated its emergency response program for the James A. Vann, Jr. Power Plant with the Andalusia Fire Department's Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the Gantt Fire Department, the River Falls Fire Department, the Covington County sheriff's department, and the Andalusia hospital.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDuring the most recent hazard review, it was concluded that the James A.

Power Plant has installed all necessary equipment and has provided the operating and training procedures required for safe operation of the aqueous ammonia storage and transfer system.\n\n\n\n04/06/2012 Update:  As a result of the 11/03/2012 ammonia release, PowerSouth has upgraded all the ammonia piping in this process from PVC to stainless steel.  As a safeguard to prevent a reoccurence of a similar event as the 11/03/2012-release, process alarms have been installed to provide visual and audible alarms to system operators should an ammonia flow occur during times when the ammonia feed process is off.  Once an alarm occurs, it can only be deactivated via a manual action by the sytem operator, thus ensuring early detection of a potential ammonia release.\n\n\n\n"
