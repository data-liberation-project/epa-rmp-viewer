The alternate case release scenario was determined to be from a tubing (pigtail) failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in a release.  Other potential alternate case release factors listed by EPA for consideration (transfer hose releases, process piping releases, process vessel releases due to cracks or failures, and releases during shipping) were not as likely to occur and/or did not result in an off-site release.  \n\nSite specific worst case and alternate case release scenarios were evaluated based upon the regulatory requirements using EPA\u0012s RMP*Comp program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u0012s (NOAA) ALOHA modeling program, and Risk Management Program guidance documents.  These methods were evaluated since they are widely accepted by EPA, fire departments, and industry as methods for performing potential release analyses.  Other potential methods (propriety models), while having merit, were not as likely to be useful to plan for potential emergency incidents, coordinate those plans with fire departments and local emergency planning commissions, and communicate the plans to employees and the public.  \n\nNOAAs ALOHA model is generally used as an emergency response tool by fire departments and emergency responders to actual emergency situations whereas EPA\u0012s RMP*Comp is designed to be used as a plan"

In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the City of Pueblo RMP document describes the following components of a RMP:\n\n7 A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and off-site impacts of worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n \n7 A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances.\n \n7 An emergency action plan to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n \n7 An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with regulations cited at 40 CFR 68.155 through 68.185 for the on-site disinfection and de-chlorination processes covered by RMP regulations.  \n\nThe primary activity at the wastewater treatment plant is the treatment of wastewater for the City of Pueblo, Colorado.

RMP*Comp modeling results showed good correlation with lookup tables in guidance documents available to industry, and accordingly are most representative of values most often used by other facilities.  Thus, RMP*Comp was determined to be the most appropriate method for performing off-site consequence analyses at the plant.  \n\nAn urban setting was used to reflect the topography (river bluffs, low lying areas, and trees) of the area resulting in obstructed air patterns at and surrounding the plant.  Rural conditions may be applicable east of the plant but since wind directions may be from any direction and are seasonal, the urban setting, representative of obstructed air patterns, was determined to be most applicable.\n\nThe calculated distances to the endpoints were plotted as a radius from the site (since wind direction may be from any direction) and a circular area of potential impact was determined.  It should be noted that a potential plume from the plant would likely be linear or tear drop in shape and impact only a small portion of the circular potential area of impact that is defined from the radius.  \n\nCensus data was determined for the area of potential impact using U.S. Commerce, Bureau of the Census  LANDVIEW\u0019  data and a United States Geological Survey topographic map for both the worst and alternate case release scenarios.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is based on a catastrophic failure of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide holding tank due to corrosion, impacts, or structural failure.  The entire 2,000 pound tank capacity is assumed to disperse at a rate of 200 pounds per minute for a period of 10 minutes from its outside storage area.\n\nThe modeled distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine and sulfur dioxide under the worst case scenario are calculated as follows:\n\nChlorine - 1.3 miles\nSulfur dioxide - 1.3 miles\n\nThe alternate case scenario was calculated for a release of chlorine and of sulfur dioxide from a 1/2 inch diameter hole in a pigtail."

Sensitivity analysis on the release time indicated that the radius to the toxic endpoint is the same if the release is allowed to proceed for up to 60 minutes.
