Examples of activities under the program include trained personnel operating and maintaining our processes, cooperative industry response alliances (Channel Industries Mutual Aid or CIMA) and close interaction with Community response agencies (LEPC, Fire Departments).  The storage of chemicals on site is minimized and chemicals are kept on site on an as needed basis.  \n\n\n\nFail safe systems are installed to protect our personnel as well as the public from effects of release or impacts of on-site chemicals.  On-site emergency response personnel are trained to quickly respond to mitigate damage to personnel, public and property.  A community notification system is in place and personnel are trained to inform the public of any incident or event that has an impact or possible effect with an emphasis on public protection.\n\n\n\nThere has been no injury from release of RMP flammable chemicals or toxic chemicals during the five-year accident history of the plant.  \n\n\n\nThis submittal adds the information regarding the potential to temporarily store a transportation container on methyl chloride on site in preparation for starting production of one of the products.  \n\n\n\nAs a mitigation measure, the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan which has been developed based on best management practices, regulatory requirements such as PSM and RMP, voluntary compliance programs (OSHA VPP, ISO 14001 and RC-14001), corporate guidance and industry sharing of experience.  The plan includes specific response to many possible emergency and release scenarios.  The plan is refined continually as a result of practice and dril"
