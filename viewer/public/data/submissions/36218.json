      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency\n\nOccidental Permian Ltd's. Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release safeguards and programs, along with emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and to protect the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Welch CO2 Process Facility personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility is to provide CO2 for injection into oil formations, thus enhancing oil recovery.  The plant includes facilities for compressing, sweetening, treating, dehydrating and separating the gas.  The plant contains several regulated flammables, including methane, ethane, propane, i-butane, n-butane, i-pentane, and n-pentane.  In addition, the gas plant processes hydrogen sulfide (H2S), also a regulated substance, but not in an amount above the threshold limit for H2S. The plant sales a process stream of natural gas liquids.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with the flammable mix inventory being the source of our worst case scenario.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWelch CO2 Gas Processing Facility qualifies as a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental r"

Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures.  It also contains plans for evacuation, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  In the event of fire, explosion, or release of the regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan.\n\n\nPlanning Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing Welch CO2 Gas Process Facility incidents.\n2.  We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental plants.\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\n\n\nCertification\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the flammable mix inventory is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nWithin the past 5 years the Welch CO2 Gas Processing Facility pr"
