Several different contractors have been used (and will be used), including Blick's Phosphate conversions, LLC of Garden City, KS.  The liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in railcars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered in railcars and the most anhydrous ammonia railcars at the facility at any one time is six (6).  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The information reported in this section was obtained from Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC Garden City, KS RMP.",

              "Description": "This facility is a farm cooperative.  We store and provide for application, anhydrous ammonia, dry fertilizers, and several dry and liquid pesticides.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The existing tank was emptied, pipes disconnected and tank disassembled in the summer of 2004, but was re-piped and re-assembled in early 2006.  The second 18,000 gallon storage tank was moved to the facility in early 2006.  After the two tanks were re-assembled, a new hazard review and a new compliance audit were completed at the facility.  The anhydrous ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker truck and railcars, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling is done by our own employees.  The prevention program consists of seven (7) elements (safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation).",
