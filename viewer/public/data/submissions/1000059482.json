The facility is located at 625 E. US Highway 36. Equistar employs approximately 100 full time employees at the plant site.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary \r\nsource (\u00a7 68.155a):\r\n\r\nEquistar is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public \r\nand the environment.  As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help \r\nensure safe operation of the processes at the Tuscola Plant. One component of this system is a \r\nrisk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with \r\nthe requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental \r\nRelease Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the \r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) \r\nStandard (29 CFR 1910.119).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of \r\nthe RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the \r\nPlant.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk management program at the Tuscola Plant helps provide assurance that the \r\nfacility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety \r\nprogram at the Plant. In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing \r\nmany levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and \r\ndamage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, industry \r\nstandards and best practices.  To effectively implement these policies, Equistar has established a \r\nmanagement system headed by the"

      "SummaryText": "cesses) at the Tuscola Plant are covered under the RMP Rule: \r\nAlcohol Plant (includes Synthesis and \r\nFinishing, Ether Purification Unit, and Tank Farm). The Tuscola Plant handles three flammable substances - ethyl ether, ethylene, and acetaldehyde - in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule and falls under the Level 3 \r\nProgram. \r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternate release scenarios, including \r\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each \r\nreported scenario (\u00a7 68.155c):\r\n\r\nThe Tuscola Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental \r\nrelease of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule \r\nrequires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a worst-case release scenario  (WCS) and \r\nan alternative release scenario (ARS) for each toxic and one for all flammables.   In reality, \r\nhowever, Equistar does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative \r\nrelease scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response \r\nplan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               RMP Comp was used for evaluating the worst and alternate case release scenarios for flammable materials. United States Geological Survey (USGS) maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance. Specific scenario information along with public and environmental receptor data has been provided in data elements portion of  EPA's RMP Submit Program.\r\n \r\n4.

When a hazardous substance is used, the chemical must be \r\napproved by the Health, Safety, and Environmental Department by undergoing an environmental and safety \r\nanalysis on the chemical to consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant \r\nworkers, the public and the environment.  Any adverse effects must be addressed before the \r\nchemical is approved. \r\n\r\nEquistar strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the \r\nfacility: Equistar is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the \r\nenvironment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Equistar \r\nimplements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a \r\nhazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained \r\nto reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely \r\nadhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses \r\nFire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing \r\nprocesses.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires \r\nthe documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with \r\nregard to these procedures as part of the management of change process. Equistar's mechanical \r\nintegrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the \r\nequipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.
