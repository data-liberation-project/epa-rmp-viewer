CONTAINMENT - All distribution/storage areas are inherently spill-containing.  The building walls also provide passive mitigation.  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES - All employees are trained and qualified in safe handling of EHS chemicals.  MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - Authorization is required for all changes affecting equipment, procedures, or facility.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM - Comprehensive plan includes employee training, fire and spill response equipment, on-site medical facilities, and procedures for facility drills.",
