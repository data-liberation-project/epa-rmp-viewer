      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document is an update to the Cholla Water Treatment Plant (CWTP) Risk Management Program (RMP) that was submitted to U.S. EPA in May 1999 and March 2005.   In accordance with RMP guidance documents and regulations, all administrative and operational changes at the facility since 1999 are documented.\r\n\r\nIn June 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued Risk Management (RM) program regulations (40 CFR, Part 68).  Regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), the RMPRMP requires facilities that store large amounts of listed hazardous chemical substances to prepare and implement risk management plans to reduce the probability of accidental releases and minimize the health risks to the public and the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP regulates 77 listed toxic substances and 63 listed flammable substances.  Of the 140 toxic and flammable chemicals regulated by the RMP, the CWTP has only one such listed chemical (anhydrous chlorine) that is used to disinfect drinking water provided to the residents of Glendale.  The terms anhydrous chlorine and chlorine are used interchangeably and specifically refer to a chemical listed in the RMP regulations.  When used as a disinfectant, chlorine prevents the spread of waterborne diseases and has been used for years in the water treatment industry.  When properly used, chlorine has proven to be both safe and effective. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the CWTP, the RMP regulations apply to an estimated 7,200 public and private drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities nationwide where chlorine and/or ammonia are used as disinfectants.  As with other facilities across the U.S., the City of Glendale views the RMP as a vehicle to communicate emergency response procedures to the public and emergency planning agencies.  \r\n\r\nMinimizing Risk\r\nThe major driving force in the development of the RMP regulations is reducing the risk to public health by minimizing the potential of a chemical re"

      "SummaryText": "lease.  At CWTP, there is a multi-layer system in place to meet this goal.  As part of the RMP, operators are trained in dealing with the day-to-day handling of chlorine.  Chlorine detectors are located in areas where chlorine is stored and/or used and provide a warning in the event of a release.  Trained personnel respond to chlorine alarms to assess whether a chlorine release poses an imminent danger to employees or the public.  While safety features such as a low pressure chlorine delivery system make a significant release unlikely, in the event that a release does occur, response plans have been developed.  The emergency response plans include assistance from outside agencies, as well as operators trained to take appropriate action such as contacting the Glendale Fire Department (GFD).  The GFDA\u00bfs emergency response time is 5 minutes or less. \r\n\r\nManagement Plan\r\nWithin the management and administrative roles of the CWTP, responsibility has been defined to coordinate and implement the RMP.  Overall development and management of the RMP is the responsibility of the RMP Manager.  The RMP Coordinator reports to the RMP Manager and is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the RMP.  The CWTP Safety Administrator is responsible for the overall record keeping of the RMP and reports to the RMP Coordinator.  The Chief Plant Operator is responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the RMP and reports to the RMP Manager.  Additional program oversight is provided by the City of GlendaleA\u00bfs Environmental Resources Administrator and Employee Safety Manager who act as external auditors of the programA\u00bfs implementation and overall quality.  \r\n\r\nFor the CWTP, the following personnel have been assigned to coordinate and implement the RMP:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe Superintendent of Plant Operations is the designated RMP Manager\r\nA\u00bf\tThe Safety & Security Coordinator is the designated RMP Coordinator\r\n\r\nThe Safety & Security Coordinator is also the delegated coordinator for the Oc"

The requirements of the PSM program largely parallel RMP requirements.  Because of the similarities in the two programs, the RMP Coordinator will be referred to as the RM/PSM Program Coordinator throughout this document. \r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\r\nCWTP modeled three potential release events for chlorine and followed EPA guidance to identify a worst case release scenario (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the EPA regulations.  Toxic endpoints were identified using EPA-approved methods.  \r\n\r\nA A\u00bfworst case scenarioA\u00bf is defined by the EPA as the result of a release from the largest container and/or pipe over a span of 10 minutes.  The distance to a toxic endpoint is defined by emergency response planning guidelines level 2 (ERPG-2) as a concentration a person can be exposed to for up to 1 hour without experiencing serious health effects.  The distance to a toxic endpoint is used to determine the affected geographical area and population for emergency planning purposes.  The ERPG-2 value for chlorine is 3 parts per million by volume (ppmv).\r\n\r\nEPA states that a WCS is useful for encouraging A\u00bfcommunity dialogueA\u00bf.  However, because the WCS does not necessarily represent events likely to occur, it is more useful for discussion purposes than for emergency planning purposes.  An A\u00bfalternative release scenarioA\u00bf is a release scenario more likely than the WCS and can be used for emergency response planning.\r\n\r\nThe WCS for the CWTP is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the WCS is 1.33 miles, affecting approximately 5.6 square miles and an estimated population of 34,719. \r\n\r\nThe ACS is based on an operator opening the chlorine container valve before connecting the flexible piping (pigtail) resulting in a release of gaseous chlorine.

This program is required by both the RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  The prevention program for the chlorine process has been in place since 1995.  Key provisions of the CWTP prevention program are as follows:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tWritten procedures have been prepared for the covered process, including directions for safe start-up and shutdown, operations and emergency shutdown.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tCWTP employees who operate the chlorine system must receive training initially and periodically on safe start-up/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown.  \r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tIncidences, including minor releases are investigated to improve the safety of the process.  \r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tOnce completed, incident investigations are shared with employees.  \r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tEmployees participate in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identifies potential hazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or when significant changes are made to the process.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tThe CWTP has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates changes to the chlorine system are reviewed prior to the change to ensure that the change will not compromise safety.\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tAn equipment design and maintenance program is in place that assures mechanical integrity.

This program consists of personnel trained to recognize releases, assess the situation, and engage the proper emergency response personnel.  When external emergency response is required, plant personnel will notify the GFD then establish an incident command system that is transferred to the GFD upon their arrival. Once GFD establishes command, they are supported by CWTP personnel familiar with the affected process.  The GFD has access to additional emergency response resources, including the City of Glendale Police Department, Red Cross, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and other agencies, as needed.\r\n\r\nImprovements Since Last Report Submission\r\nThe CWTP installed a vacuum system starting at the chlorine ton container to limit potential risk of a chlorine release to the surrounding environment.  This system eliminates piping with pressurized chlorine gas.  Any leak beyond this point will be minimized due to vacuum on the lines instead of pressure in the piping system."
