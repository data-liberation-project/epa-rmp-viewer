Accident release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture and store gases used in steel making. The hydrogen stored at this facility is use in the annealing gas process used in the manufacturing of steel products.  The amounts of hydrogen handled by this faclity exceeds the threshold quantities set by the EPA.It is our ploicy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Air products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspection, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, and relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel suppliment the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emrgency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the nitoifcation of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios describe were selected based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nPure liquid hydrogen is stored in 2 (two) 20,000 gallon tanks. The liquid hydrogen is delivered to the site by tank truck. The liquid hydrogenis vaporized by ambient air vaproizers located adjacent to the tanks.  The gaseous hydrogen is piped to the customer, where they (the customer) blend it with nitrogen at a 3:1 ratio to produce an annealing gas used in the production of steel products.  Gaseous hydrogen is also used o"

Hydrogen is the only regulated substance handled at this facility in an amount exceeding a threshold quantity.  The maximum amount of hydrogen at this facility is 24,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulation.  This facility was designed and contrusted to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammible gas that has resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacutations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilities emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Cleveland Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n6.  Plannned changes to improve safety:\n\nAt this time, there are no major administrative, operational, process, or equipment changes planned for this facility."
