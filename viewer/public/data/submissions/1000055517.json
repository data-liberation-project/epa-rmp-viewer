      "SummaryText": "A.    It is the policy of Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) Corn Processing Facility, Peoria, Illinois to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  The objective is to prevent an explosion/fire or release to minimize the potential impact to ADM's employees, the public, and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing good operating procedures, maintaining a preventative maintenance program, providing appropriate training to employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary with the Peoria Fire Department.\n\n\n\nB.    Stationary source and regulated substances handled.  This facility consists of a Corn Wet Milling plant that processes corn into value products such as fuel ethanol and dry specialty products along with a Cogeneration facility that supplies the facility's energy requirements.\n\n\n\nIn this update of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), ADM has included programs for its denaturant used in the production of fuel ethanol.  The denaturant (natural gasoline) used at the facilities has a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating that can vary between 3 and 4 and thus can be exempt from the RMP according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2) at any given time.  Due to the potential variability in the make-up of this additive, it is possible that ADM will receive material that has a flammability rating of 4.  Therefore, ADM has included provisions in the RMP for managing the denaturant as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is a mixture of predominantly aliphatic hydrocarbons, the most predominant being pentanes.\n\n\n\nC.    Off-Site consequence analysis.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis, ADM used RMP*Comp Version 1.07 and Aloha Version 5.3 provided by the EPA.  Aloha was used to model the liquid release rate in the alternate scenario, while RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scena"

      "SummaryText": "rio for flammable substances.  For multiple flammable substances subject to Program 2 requirements, the EPA requires that a worst-case scenario be evaluated for the flammable substance estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint.  The worst-case scenario for substances that are normally liquids at ambient temperature assumes that the single largest container fails catastrophically and the entire contents are released.  The worst-case scenario for this facility involves a catastrophic release from a denaturant (natural gasoline) storage tank, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch).  Safe handling procedures, control devices, and work practices make this scenario extremely unlikely.\n\n\n\nA more realistic release scenario involving pentanes would be a break in the line supplying liquid denaturant from the storage tank to the process, or a storage tank leak.\n\n\n\nD.    Accidental release prevention. The key concepts in this facility's prevention program are the elements of the EPA's Risk Management Program Level 2 requirements, which this facility is subject to.  These concepts include safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.\n\n\n\nE.    Five-Year accident history.  This facility has not had any accident involving pentane that requires reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\n\n\nF.    Emergency Response Program.  Emergency response at this facility is coordinated with ADM and the Peoria Fire Department, so that in the event of an accident, immediate response measures will be implemented.  This facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which addresses response to accidental releases of hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nG.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Based upon the Hazard Review and the PHA process, a new pump is planned on being added to eliminate the need for denaturant trucks to be running in order to operate"
