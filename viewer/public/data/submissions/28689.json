The Facility Policy\n\n    AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC, and the employees of the AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC - West in Brunswick are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Brunswick Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry and liquid fertilizer for direct application as a crop nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia for direct application of making liquid fertilizer. The facility also handles pesticides and grain. \n\n    The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at any one time would be 140,196 pounds. The facility has (1) 18,000-gallon storage tank, (1) 12,000-gallon storage tank, the 18,000-gallon storage tank is the largest tank onsite containing approximately 84,118 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 84,118 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.9 miles.\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or ma"
