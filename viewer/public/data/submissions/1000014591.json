Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are as follows:\n     \nAll operational and emergency response aspects of the ammonia system located at the Miller Electric Mfg. Co. facility are contracted to Bassett Mechanical.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled are as follows:\n\nThe primary activity at the Miller Electric Mfg. Co. facility is the manufacture of welding power sources and associated equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the air conditioning system that serves this facility.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia that may be stored on-site is 16,000 pounds.  The largest single component in the system may contain 11,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario are as follows:\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Failure of the high pressure receiver system would release 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  The high pressure receiver will never be filled to more than 80% of its capacity.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released over a period of ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario -  A release of ammonia through an orifice of 1/4\" effective diameter at high pressure receiver conditions of 180 psig.  This scenario is representative of several scenarios, which may include a pump seal leak, valve packing failure, or gasket rupture.  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps are as follows:\n\nThis facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history is as follows:\n\nThere is no history of off-site releases from this facility.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program is as follows:\n\nThis facility is included in a local emergency response plan under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.  This plan is coor"

Bassett Mechanical is under contract to Miller for operation, maintenance, and emergency response for the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility.  Miller has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify external emergency responders when necessary.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety are as follows:\n\nAll ammonia releases, regardless of size, are investigated following incident investigation procedures.  The objective is to identify recommendations that will prevent these releases from re-occurring.  Safety improvements are made to equipment and procedures using this technique to continually improve the safety of the ammonia refridgeration system at the Appleton facility.  These procedures in conjunction with hazard analysis findings, audit findings, and continuous scrutiny of the system following mechanical integrity procedures result in continuous upgrades to minimize the likelihood of ammonia releases."
