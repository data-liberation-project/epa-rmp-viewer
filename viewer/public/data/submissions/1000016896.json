      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION AND RMP-REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Petro Star Valdez Refinery consists of a 50,000 barrel per day refinery that produces middle distillate fuels for distribution via tanker trucks.  The refinery also consists of a hydrogen plant, diesel hydro treater and sulfur recovery unit for the production of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel.  There are 10 product tanks of varying s from 20,000 barrels to 60,000 barrels.  Crude oil is supplied from the Alyeska Pipeline Metering Building through two 8\" pipeline and all residual is returned through a third 10\" pipeline.  All of the products are transported via tanker truck from an onsite loading facility consisting of two lanes and multiple loading connections.  A fuel testing laboratory is also located onsite and is operated under contract by Caleb Brett personnel.  Copper Valley Electric Association also operates an electrical co-generation facility adjacent to our crude furnace.  Petro Star supplies this facility with LSR (light straight run) as a fuel source and takes TEG (turbine exhaust gas) as pre-heated combustion air to the crude furnace.\n\nSignificant hazards at the facility are hydrocarbons processed and transported at elevated temperatures and pressures and streams containing high concentrations of Hydrogen Sulfide.  There are also a multitude of chemicals stored and used on site that present potential exposure hazards ranging from minor irritants to highly corrosive caustics and acids.  A full list of chemicals stored on site can be found in the Hazardous Communications Program.  The laboratory contains numerous chemicals in small quantities.  The substance regulated by 40 CFR 68 present at the facility in quantities exceeding the minimum threshold are flammable liquids.\n\nCATASTROPHIC RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe first line of defense to preventing a release to the atmosphere is in the facility design.  Generally accepted and good engineering practices have been used to design the facility and continue to be"

Safe design includes the construction of each piece of equipment as well as the process controls put into place to prevent systems from exceeding their design intention.  Other critical design features are Emergency Shutdown Systems and Over pressure protection systems.\n\nThe second line of defense is standard operating procedures, safe work practices and training.  Operating procedures are developed for every stage of operations to assure that the facility is operated safely and within its design intentions.  Safe practices such as hot work permits, good house keeping, opening process equipment and car program.   Affected employees are training initially and periodically to ensure a competent safely run workforce.\n\nA third line of defense is the inspection, testing and preventive maintenance programs to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  This includes monitoring the integrity of piping, tanks, vessels, safety systems, rotating equipment, instrumentation and other equipment for deficiencies and correcting those deficiencies when they are outside of acceptable limits. \n\nA fourth line of defense to preventing hazardous release is to conduct periodic hazards analysis of the facility design, procedures, safe practices and human factors to ensure that all of the elements of a safe facility are functioning safely.  Process Hazards Analyses are conducted when a facility or process is initially designed and every 5 years thereafter.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWhile the Petro Star - Valdez refinery has experienced some incidents and accidents, no accidents have occurred which meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn on-site emergency response team is trained to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release. Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.). Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams. Ad"
