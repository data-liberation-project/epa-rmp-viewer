Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n    The facility uses hydrofluoric acid which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make hydrofluoric acid valuable as a commodity also make is necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co- workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle hydrofluoric acid, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n    The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potential affected neighbors.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n    Two (2) 55-gallon drums of a 70% hydrofluoric acid solution are unloaded and stored within a building.  Approximately 29 gallons of the solutions is pumped into a process tank containing approximately 399 gallons of water.  Metal parts are dipped into the tank as part of a passivation process.  Passivation is the changing of the chemically active surface of a metal to a less reactive state by means of an acid dip.\n    Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized manage- ment personnel and authorized contractors.   The regulate substance handled at this facility is hydrofluoric acid.  The total inventory of hydrofluoric acid stored at this plant is 1,080 pounds.\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative control and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\n    Worst-Case Scenario - A spill of a drum of hydrofluoric acid would release 540 po"

This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario - A 1-1/2\" hose breaks loose in a diked area inside the building.  There is a liquid release.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.016 mg/l is 0.06 miles.  This has the potential to extend past the facility's boundary.\n\n\n\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevent- ion steps\n\n    This distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.\n    Routine maintenance and component checks will be performed monthly to insure safety and performance of the system.\n\n5.     Five-year accident history\n\n    There has been no accidental release of hydrofluoric acid within the past five years.\n\n6.     The emergency response program\n\n    In the event of a spill of hydrofluoric acid solution, the following action will be taken:\n\n    1.    Alert the main office, plant, fire department, police department, and all local emergency response agencies and teams.\n\n    2.    Alert all employees and check all departments for fire, injuries or unsafe conditions.\n\n    3.    Avoid inhalation of fumes or vapors released.\n\n    4.    Supervisors and foremen to keep employees orderly and guided out of harms way.\n\n    5.    Bill Prater and Don Cheek will give direction and assistance to employees.  They will answer questions from local authorities and assist in any effort to control or manage the catastrophe.\n\n    6.    Fire extinguishers are located in all departments to put out small fires.\n\n    7.    If an evacuation of the plant is deemed necessary, employees will be escorted to the front parking lot for assembly, kept together and there await further instruction.\n\n    8.    Care should be taken to see that the injured are taken care of and medical attention given at the earliest possible moment.  Emergency number"
