Like our local community and industrial neighbors, the people who work at the Bucks plant want a clean, safe environment, with no illnesses or injuries at work, home, or play.  That is why US Amines has a \"zero incidents\" goal.  We are committed to reducing emissions and continuously improving our performance toward zero injuries and zero environmental incidents.\n\n\n\nThe US Amines Bucks Plant participates in a local community advisory panel and works with other area industrial facilities to promote safety in our operations.  The Lemoyne Community Advisory Panel was one of the first community advisory panels established in the United States.  The Lemoyne Industrial Park companies have been recognized by local, state, and national organizations for outstanding cooperation.  This continued partnership ensures that the community where we all live and work will be a safe place now and in the future.\n\n\n\nOur Facility and Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nWe manufacture several different chemicals called alkyl amines.  Our products are used to produce agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and drugs.  Our Isopropylamine is a chemical combination of isopropyl alcohol (the same chemical as in rubbing alcohol) and ammonia (the same chemical as in home floor cleaning products).  This is sold to other chemical manufacturers who make herbicides and agriculture products like the popular home and farm products.  The chemicals that we handle and report on include the following RMP listed chemicals: ammonia, isopropylamine, cyclohexylamine, and propionitrile.  We have about 50 site employees (about 35 company employees and 15 resident contractors).\n\n\n\nPlant Safety Activities and Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe plant has a plant manager who oversees all plant activities.  The staff includes an occupational s"

All plant employees must attend at least one safety meeting per month.  Safety meetings include training on regulatory requirements and plant specific issues.  Testing is conducted in safety meetings to insure the information is understood.  The plant conducts monthly self-paced computer based training on regulatory safety topics which includes testing to demonstrate comprehension.  Plant operators and other employees are members of the Bucks Emergency Services Team (BEST team) that has the capability of handling most foreseeable incidents.  Mutual aid agreements with other local industrial sites and local fire and emergency response agencies complement the emergency response plan.  The BEST team members are trained in the specifics of incident command, emergency response, rope rescue, and medical response.  The plant conducts weekly tests of the plant alarm system and conducts emergency response drills with local industrial facilities, local fire departments, and the county emergency response team, Mobile County EMA.\n\n\n\nThe US Amines Bucks plant complies with RMP and OSHA 1910.119, (the OSHA Process Safety Regulation) through our consolidated Process Safety Management Program.  The Bucks plant manages all plant processes per our Process Safety Management program.  The program meets all of the RMP and OSHA requirements such as:\n\n\n\n*  Develop and implement a risk management system.\n\n*  Conduct hazard assessments of all processes.\n\n*  Implement accident prevention requirements.\n\n*  Develop an emergency response program that is coordinated with local agencies.\n\n*  Track and analyze incidents to prevent reoccurrence.\n\n"
