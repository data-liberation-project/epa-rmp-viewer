Accordingly, the NAICS Code is 22132.  The facility is located at 1662 South Cameron Street, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  It is owned and operated by Capital Region Water.\n\n\n\nThe AWTF is a stationary source with one process assigned to Program Level 2.  The regulated substance of the one process include chlorine.  The chlorine disinfection process involves one building which includes a chlorine cylinder room, a chlorine scale and various safety equipment; and an adjacent room which houses two chlorinators with rotameters, water injectors and various safety equipment.  The total amount of chlorine handled is four one-ton cylinders.  The treatment facility is manned 24 hours per day seven day per week.  The operators visit the chlorine process at least twice per day and respond to trouble alarms which may occur.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the AWTF to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  Management commitment to process safety is a critical element of the AWTF's Risk Management Program to ensure that program elements are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis; and, all parties understand the lines of responsibility and communications.  Management documentation is found in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration for a chlorine release scenario identified as worst case release and alternative scenario.  Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed utilizing the RMP*Comp program.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for chlorine assumes that the entire quantity of the one-ton cylinder is completely released over a ten minute period.  The toxic endpoint distance are calculated for releases that are assume"

A toxic endpoint distance of 1.3 miles was obtained and an average residential population potentially affected was 12,435.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine alternative release scenario is described as an event which is likely to occur.  The AWTF scenario involves the breaking of the A? - inch discharge line.  The cylinder and line are located in an enclosed space with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit .  The pressure within a full cylinder is 85 psi.  The response action to correct is to close the discharge valve on the cylinder, then replace the pipe.  The time required to close the valve is ten minutes.  A toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles was obtained and an average residential population potentially affected was zero.\n\n\n\nThe toxic endpoint distances for each scenario are drawn on topographical maps which can be found in Appendix B.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the AWTF prevention program is to ensure that management staff and employees understand the safety related aspects of the equipment and processes, know what limits they place on operations, and adopt accepted standards and codes where they apply.  Key elements to the program include: training, preventive maintenance, state-of-the-art process and safety equipment, operating procedures, hazard review, auditing, and inspection.\n\n\n\nThe AWTF did not have any accidental release from regulated substances from a covered process nor any accidental release meeting specific criteria in the past five years.\n\n    \n\nThe AWTF is a non-responding facility, as such, the AWTF has coordinated efforts with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency and that the community has a strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat of a release of a regulated substance.  The Emergency Contact List is found in Appendix C.\n\n"
