Accidental release prevention and emergency action policies.\n\nIn this publicly owned treatment works (POTW), chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemicals are handled, which are considered hazardous by the United Stated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties which make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the same to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat  to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal  and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency action plan is based upon guidance from EPA documentation.  The emergency action plans includes procedures for notification of the City of Harrison fire authority, notification of the Boone County Office of Emergency Services, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat residential and industrial sewage discharge.  The facility has equipment for unloading DOT 1-ton cylinders of chlorine and sodium dioxide.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The total inventory of chlorine is 4-tons (4, 1-ton cylinders), and the total inventory of sodium dioxide is 4-tons (4, 1-ton cylinders).\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Cl2, Failure of  a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine would release 2,000 poun"
