      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - SHERWOOD GAS PLANT\r\n\r\nMarkWest Liberty Midstream and Resources, L.L.C., owner and operator of the Sherwood Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sherwood Gas Plant is comprised of one compressor station, nine 200 mmscf/d cryogenic processing plants, and one 60,000 bbl/d de-ethanizer.  The compressor station brings in low pressure gas, compresses the gas and then pushes it through a dehydration process, which removes water prior to entry into the gas processing plant.  There are 3 - 400 bbl and 1 - 500 bbl atmospheric storage tanks associated with the process.  \r\nThe cryogenic processing plants process raw gas from a field gathering system. Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates condensate and impurities from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, dehydrated to remove any water, and is then sent to a turbo-expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the methane gas stream. The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane. The methane is then transported offsite via a sales pipeline. The NGLs are sent to the de-ethanizer where ethane is separated and transported offsite via pipeline. The remaining NGL stream is either stored onsite in one of four (4) 70,000 gal pressurized storage tanks or transported offsite via pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENA"

The two scenarios evaluated were the release of the entire contents of a 84,000 gallon de-ethanizer surge tank and the release of a 70,000 gallon NGL storage tank.  Modeling using the RMP-COMP model shows the worst-case scenario is the release from the de-ethanizer surge tank.  \r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, a release similar to the incident which occurred on October 9, 2014 was modeled in RMP Comp. The release scenario considers a hose rupture during filling operations at the NGL truck loading area which causes the release of 17,000 lbs of regulated substance. For the scenario, 20,000 lbs of condensate was chosen for the RMP Comp calculation to be conservative.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest Liberty Midstream and Resources, L.L.C., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.
