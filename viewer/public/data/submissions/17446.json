Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes and effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nCyclohexylamine is the only regulated substance held above the regulatory threshold quantity.  Cyclohexylamine is used in the processing of chemicals for the marine industry.  Pure drummed cyclohexylamine is stored outdoors in rows on asphalt pavement.  This is the only area in the facility where the substance exceeds the USEPA listed threshold quantity as defined in 40 CFR 68.130.  The remaining processing and finished product storage areas are not covered.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require t"

The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.

A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.
