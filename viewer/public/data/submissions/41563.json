      "SummaryText": "The Beckley Water Company water treatment system utilizes chlorine gas for disinfection purposes.  The facility utilizes one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas which are received at the facility every two months with six cylinders delivered at any one time.  Up to two cylinders are maintained on-site at any one time.  All cylinders are stored inside the water treatment plant chlorine cylinder storage building.  The process utilizes one cylinder on-line at any one time.  One additional cylinder is connected to an automatic transfer system.  The automatic transfer system allows the second sylinder to go on-line as soon as the chlorine from the first cylinder has been totally utilized.  The average chlorine usage rate at this facility is 250 to 500 pounds per day.  The Beckley Water Company water system utilizes a Wallace and Tiernan (WT) chlorinator system.  This system operates such that the chlorine transfer from the cylinder to the chlorinators is under vacuum versus pressure.  This type of arrangement provides for minimal potential for leaks of chlorine through the piping.  The only section of the system which is not under vacuum is the piping from the cylinder valves to the cylinder manifold which is under pressure.  The facility has a preventive maintenance program which is designed to maintain the equipment that handles chlorine gas in a good operating mode. Chlorine cylinders are received from the vendor and the transfer of the cylinders from the truck to the chlorine storage building is always performed during daylight hours, and is attended by the truck driver and a Beckley Water Company water treatment plant operator.  The Beckley Water Company's Sweenysburg Plant is manned by one employee for four hours per day.  There are two chlorine sensor systems located at the facility.  These sensors are designed to detect any chlorine release within either the chlorine cylinder storage area or the chlorinator room.  Both the chlorinator room and chlorine storage building"

      "SummaryText": "are designed with exhaust fans that are automatically started if a chlorine release is identified by either of the sensors.\n\nThe alternative scenario identified for this facility would be for failure of the hoke piping which connects to the cylinder.  If this piping and related regulator valve failed, a maximum of 50 pounds per hour of chlorine gas could be released from one cylinder.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n\nIn the event of a severe chlorine release, the Beckley Water Company employees are instructed to call 911 and request assistance from the Bradley Prosperity Volunteer Fire Department.  The Bradley Prosperity Volunteer Fire Department personnel can respond within 10 minutes and have the adequate personal protective equipment to isolate valves in the event of such an incident.  Regarding lower volume incidents involving minor leaks, the Beckley Water Company has a contract with PB&S, the supplier of chlorine cylinders to the facility, provides emergency response to any chlorine releases.  The PB&S personnel can be on-site within 2 hours of notification.  Once the chlorine usage area has been adequately ventilated and the release of chlorine stopped, Beckley Water Company personnel will enter into the area to perform any necessary repair work.  Beckley Water Company personnel will enter into the chlorine usage area in the event of an alarm situation to assess the condition and perform minor emergency response.  The facility is covered under a general emergency response plan implemented by the Raleigh County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The facility also has an emergency response plan for evacuation of employees and performace of critical operations in the event of an emergency.\n\nTRAINING\n\nOne (1) employee of the Beckley Water Company received chlorine awareness training from PB&S, the supplier of the chlorine cylinders.  This training was perfromed in order to insure that personnel understand the hazards of dealing with clorine gas and are familiar"

The supplier of chlorine cylinders may change on an annual basis.  Any such change will result in modification of this section of the risk management plan to insure that the current supplier is listed.\n\nAFFECTED AREA\n\nIn the event of acatastrophic release of chlorine gas, one school, one recreational area, several businesses and private residences would be affected.  For an alternative scenario release, one recreational area and several private residences would be affected."
