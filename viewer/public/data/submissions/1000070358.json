The management at Kemira is committed to ensuring chemical safety for its employees and the surrounding community through a comprehensive Risk Management Program that utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, process controls, employee training, emergency response procedures and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n1.1    Process Description\n\n\n\nThe addition of the acrylamide manufacturing process at Kemira Aberdeen triggered the need for a Risk Management Program in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Acrylamide is manufactured through hydrolysis of acrylonitrile, which is a regulated substance.  The Kemira process includes an above ground acrylonitrile storage tank with a storage capacity of 50,000 gallons (336,500 pounds).  The 112(r) threshold quantity for acrylonitrile is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the site is 325998, \"All Other Miscellaneous Chemical Products and Preparation Manufacturing.\"\n\n\n\n1.2    Facility Location and Contact\n\n\n\nThe mailing address and contact information for the Kemira Aberdeen facility is as follows:\n\n\n\n    Michael Gray, Plant Manager\n\n    Kemira Chemicals, Inc.\n\n    10930 Darracott Road\n\n        P.O.

This approach is a formal systematic critical examination of the process and engineering intentions of new or existing facilities to assess the hazard potential that arise from deviation in design specifications and the consequential effects on the facilities as a whole.  The consequences of the hazard and measures to reduce the frequency with which the hazard will occur are then discussed. This technique had gained wide acceptance in the process industries as an effective tool for plant safety and operability improvements.\n\n\n\nKemira has an Emergency Response Plan and a Spill Response Plan which provide specific guidance for handling plant-wide spills and emergencies.  Both plans were recently updated to address specific hazards associated with the acrylamide manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n\nSection 3\n\nAccidental Release Prevention \n\n\n\nKemira has implemented both procedural and technological safeguards to prevent accidental release of acrylonitrile.  Procedural safeguards are evidenced by Kemira's comprehensive operational procedures and training program.  \n\n\n\nTechnological safeguards include:\n\n?    Scrubber\n\n?    Relief valves\n\n?    Check valves\n\n?    Auto shutoff\n\n?    Manual shutoff\n\n?    Alarms\n\n?    Backup pump\n\n?    Emergency power\n\n?    Grounding equipment\n\n?    Purge system\n\n?    Process area detectors\n\n\n\nAdministrative safeguards include:\n\n?    Emergency and "
