The Newark facility receives acetylene in bulk trailers from which it then fills gas cylinders for distribution to customers.  The facility had the ability to produce acetylene on-site through calcium carbide generation and then compress it into cylinders for distribution by truck, but that operation is currently shut down and has been disconnected indefinitely.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of tile 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA;\n\n-Acetylene which is compressed into individual cylinders for sale to customers.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the best performing  industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs. Our safety, health and environmental policies call for a commitment to protecting the health & safety of our employees, neighbors and the surrounding environment. This is a basis for engineering  and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental releases and operational safety programs that ensure the safe operation of our facility. Praxair is committed to continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nPrevention program:\n\n    In accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Rule, our Newark, N.J. facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around safety concepts such as;\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances and the critical operating perameters of the associated systems and equipment.\n\n- Procedur"

Some of these features include:\n\n- An incident alarm system\n\n- Remote emergency shut-down stations\n\n- Heat activated deluge system in process and storage areas.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n-There have been 3 minor incidents in the last 5 years, all of which have been added to the RMP Accident History section. None of these incidents have had any off-site impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs:\n\n-Praxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public and the environment. The Newark facility will be a \"non-responding facility\" as defined in section 8.1 of the CEPPO General Guidance For Risk Management Programs ( July 1998). Employees will only respond to minor incidents.\n\n-For other then minor incidents Praxair has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Newark Fire Department - Ferry Street station.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n-Praxair has a commitment that is expressed in a company wide goal of Zero Accidents and Zero Injuries.
