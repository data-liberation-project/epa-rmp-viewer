We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely\n  affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n* The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n* The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAmerican Synthetic Rubber Company, LLC is located on a 60.5 acre site in the Southwest section of Jefferson County, Kentucky within the industrial area known as Rubbertown. Manufacturing operations are conducted on a seven day continuous basis. We employ approximately 370 individuals who work nominal shift hours of 7:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m. - 11 :00 p.m., or 11 :00 p.m. - 7:00 a.m. Approximately 260 employees are on site weekdays between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Approximately 47 employees operate the plant at all other times.\n\nProduct lines include solution polybutadiene (BR) and solution styrene butadiene (SSBR) rubbers, which are utilized primarily in t"

Non - bulk raw material receipts (drum /carton commodities) are generally received via common carrier. Facilities for receiving and storage of the more volatile process materials are located outdoors in areas as remote as practical from the main plant processes. These installations are typically protected and provided with a means of secondary containment (e.g. dikes) in order to minimize hazards resulting from spillage. The physical transfer of raw materials from transport container to storage and on to the various processing units is accomplished by means of pumps and/or inert gas pressure.\n\nBR and SSBR, reaction products of butadiene and butadiene / styrene respectively, are manufactured in a continuous polymerization process utilizing toluene as a diluent. Organometallic catalysts are added to initiate the reaction and carry it to the desired level of conversion. The resulting polymer solution is then pumped through a series of flash distillation units to recover the unreacted butadiene and a significant portion of the solvent, leaving a more viscous solution.\n\nThe majority of the remaining solvent is then separated (stripped) from the polymer using a steam distillation process. This occurs by bringing the polymerized rubber into contact with hot water and steam. Stripped vapors arising form this operation are condensed and recovered for reuse. The remaining crumb water slurry is then dewatered, dried, baled, containerized and warehoused.\n\nPBAN, a reaction product of butadiene/acrylonitrile/acrylic acid, is a batch process. An emulsifying agent or soap is utilized to facilitate the dispersion of the ingredients in a water medium and a catalyst added to initiate the reaction and accelerate it to completion. The"

The latex is coagulated by the addition of brine and subsequently dried. Finished product is then transferred to hold tanks pending laboratory analysis and on to storage.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off site \nconsequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nAcrylonitrile. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds. This chemical is one of the reactants used in the manufacturing of PBAN polymer.\n\nAmmonia. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Ammonia is used solely as a refrigerant in various parts of our manufacturing process.\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. This material is used as a catalyst in the manufacture of BR and SSBR rubber. It is delivered and stored in 1,150 Ib DOT shipping containers until it is introduced into our processes.\n\nFlammables:\n\n 1,3-Butadiene. We maintain an on site inventory that is greater than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. This chemical is the primary raw material used in the manufacturing of our products.\n\n Hydrogen. We maintain an on site inventory that is less than the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts allow us to effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
