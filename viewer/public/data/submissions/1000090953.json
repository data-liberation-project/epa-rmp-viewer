The regulated substances handled by this facility are Hydrogen Chloride, Trichlorosilane and Hydrogen, which are considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\n\n\nSEH America manufactures high quality silicon wafers used in the manufacture of integrated circuits.   This facility manufactures a number of different types of wafers.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride and Trichlorosilane are used in the manufacturing of epitaxial wafers.  The epitaxial process produces a thin layer of silicon on top of already polished wafers.  Hydrogen chloride is a gas that is used to etch the silicon wafer.  The maximum quantity of Hydrogen Chloride that can be stored or handled at this facility is 42,000 pounds.  (2 tube trailers of 21,000 pounds each).  Trichlorosilane is a liquid, with a maximum quantity that can be stored or handled at this facility is 78,637 pounds. Trichlorosilane is also used in the deposition of a silicon layer on top of a polished wafer.\n\n\n\nHydrogen is used in several processes in the facility.  It is frequently used as a carrier gas for other chemicals.  Hydrogen is stored as a liquefied gas at cryogenic temperature (-423 F).  The maximum quantity of Hydrogen that can presently be stored or handled at this facility is 11,812 pounds.  Messer Gas Company operates and maintains the Bulk hydrogen storage system for SEH.  SEH recently removed one liquid H2 storage tank from "

SEH America greatly values all of our employees and we are honored to be members of our community. We engineer the highest standards of safety and environmental management into our systems. \n\n\n\nSEH America will respond with its Emergency Response Team to all emergency situations including leaks or suspected leaks. To be prepared for the unlikely event that a release does occur, SEH maintains a highly trained and always ready Emergency Response Team that works closely with the Vancouver Fire Department. \n\n\n\n1.3 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSEH America complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility follows guidelines and recommended practices of the Compressed Gas Association for the safe handling and use of compressed gases such as hydrogen and hydrogen chloride. Numerous safety systems are used to prevent, detect, and mitigate releases of hazardous materials.  These include regular piping inspections, process area chemical detectors, process alarms and shutdowns, mitigation systems such as scrubbers and water sprays, and systems that fail in the \"safe\" position.  SEH has installed a seismic shutoff system to shut down the H2, HCl and TCS systems if seismic motion is detected.\n\n\n\n1.4 FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSEH America has never had a release of a regulated substance that has resulted in any deaths, injuries, off-site impacts or significant property damage on-site.\n\n\n\n1.5 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSEH America has developed an emergency response program to prevent and respond to accidental chemical releases of hazardous materials.

SEH has developed and trained an emergency response team that is highly qualified to respond to releases of hazardous materials, and is available on-site 24 hours a day.  The team regularly trains with outside responders and performs regular drills with the local Fire Department and its Hazardous Materials Team.\n\n\n\n1.6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following safety improvements have been planned for 2021 and beyond:\n\n\n\n* Additional volunteer HAZMAT personnel will be recruited and trained to respond at SEH. \n\n* SEH will be attempting to reduce hydrogen quantities on site, possibly below the PSM/RMP threshold quantities.  SEH is investigating a steam-methane reformer H2 plant.\n\n* Plant familiarization tours for new personnel for the Vancouver Fire and Police Departments are being conducted on a regular basis.\n\n* SEH conducts annual Corporate safety audits with a team assembled by members from sister plants.  The HCL, TSC, and H2 systems are reviewed in detail.   \n\n\n\nSEH America is committed to placing safety and the environment first. Our Safety & Environmental Policy stresses continuous improvement."
