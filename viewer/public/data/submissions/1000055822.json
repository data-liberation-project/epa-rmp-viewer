A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Maudlin, SC facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and guidance from Greenville County emergency response organizations.  Although the programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.\n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (\"the worst case\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative cases\").  Although it is technically infeasible for the worst case described in this report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios, which are more likely to occur.\n\n\n\nBASF CORPORATION\n\nBASF Corporation, headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey, is the North American affiliate of BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany. BASF has more than17,000 employees in North America, and had sales of $20.6 bill"

At BASF, our commitment to Responsible Care&reg; is shared by every employee.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the BASF Corporation Mauldin, SC facility to prevent all releases of potentially harmful substances.  Senior management is responsible for release prevention and response programs and the facility has invested extensive time and resources in his effort.\n\nThe facility has detailed procedures, which ensure that safety is considered in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of each process.  Facility personnel receive regular safety training and employee input is solicited on every aspect of safety improvement. Failure to follow safety policies is grounds for dismissal.\n\nIf a release were to occur, trained facility personnel would control and contain the release.  The standard procedure is to technically evaluate each situation, identify potential on-site and off-site impacts, evacuate workers as necessary, contain the release and contact the local fire department to provide the necessary emergency response services.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE    \n\nThe BASF Corporation Mauldin, SC is a chemical manufacturing facility located at 1520 Old Stage Road.

Built in the 1950's, the 38-acre facility has undergone multiple upgrades and modernization program, which has helped to make the facility a leader in productivity, process control and environmental stewardship.\n\nThe facility has a 2.8 million-gallon biological wastewater pretreatment system that is able to process the wastewater generated throughout the facility.  The wastewater pretreatment plant has received the Compliance Excellency Award from Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority/Renewable Water Resources for many years for achieving perfect compliance with all permit requirements. \n\nThe facility is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety regulations and is regularly inspected by agency representatives.   The following activities are specifically regulated: (1) Air Emissions: Regulated by various air permits issued by SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC); (2) Wastewater discharge regulated by permit issued by Renewable Water Resources; (3) Storm water discharge regulated by permit issued by SC DHEC;  (4) Hazardous Waste Generation Activity under ID# SCDO58745894; (5) Process Safety Subject to OSHA Process Safety Management Rule; (6) Emergency Planning Subject to SARA 311/312 Reporting; (7) Release Reporting Subject to SARA 313.

      "SummaryText": "overed by the RMP Rule:\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nFollowing EPA guidance, the facility performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to determine the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could have an impact on the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst case scenarios (WCSs) and alternate release scenarios (ARSs).  Based on facility design and prevention programs, the facility does not believe the worst-case release scenario could ever occur.  Although it is also highly unlikely that the ARS would occur, the ARS represents a release that is more likely to occur during the lifetime of a facility like the Mauldin facility.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The concentration at the endpoint represents the maximum concentration below which nearly all people can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing irreversible or serious health effects or symptoms which could impair the ability to take protective action.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Mauldin facility is a catastrophic failure in the ethylene oxide (EO) storage tank resulting in a release of 185,385 pounds of EO over a 10-minute period.  The EO tank is below grade in an open vault, which serves as a dike.  In the event of a release, the vault/dike would contain the released EO, which would evaporate, forming a vapor cloud.   EPA defines the toxic endpoint as that point where the concentration of EO is 50 ppm (0.090 milligrams per liter).  Although the facility has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures were taken into account when calculating the distance to the endpoint.

The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time needed for engineering controls to stop the release.  Failure of the seal was chosen as the potential release because, historically, seals have been a release point for operations of this type in the chemical industry.\n\nThe ARS for propylene oxide is a failure of the seal in the loading arm boom attached to the rail car during the PO unloading process.  The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time needed for engineering controls to stop the release.  Failure of the seal was chosen as the potential release because, historically, seals have been a release point for operations of this type in the chemical industry.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Mauldin manufacturing facility has an excellent record of accident prevention.

Employee involvement in safety programs is documented in the facility's Process Safety Manual.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSafe operation of a process starts with a detailed identification of the hazards associated with the process.  The Mauldin facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  To do this, each process at the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of trained personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.      \n\nImplementation of mitigating options in response to PHAs is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned t"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIn order to operate a process safely, facility personnel need accurate, detailed information about the process and any associated hazards.  The Mauldin facility maintains extensive technical information about the safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety data.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available in the Process Safety Section of the PSM Manual.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) within the batch cards and operating procedures. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process contro"

The information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.  Operating personnel have complete access to all of the information described above.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTo ensure that personnel operate equipment in accordance with all safety precautions, the facility maintains detailed written operating procedures.  The procedures describe the safety considerations unique to specific operating modes, e.g\n\n-unit startup,\n\n-normal operations,\n\n-temporary operations,\n\n-emergency shutdown,\n\n-normal shutdown, and\n\n-initial startup of a new process.\n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training for new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change (MOC) process that is explained in greater detail in a subsequent section.\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains batch cards and operating procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper and lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n"

New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Refresher training for all operators is conducted every 3 years.  Each training program includes a method of verifying that the operator understood the training through verbal confirmation and written tests.  All training is documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n-perform their work in a safe manner,\n\n-have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\n-are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\n-understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n\n-understand and follow site safety rules, and\n\n-inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n-a process overview,\n\n-information about safety and health hazards,\n\n-emergency response plan requirements, and- safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\nIn addition, the facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
