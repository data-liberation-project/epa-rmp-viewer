Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of D & D, Incorporated, Del Don Chemical \nCompany facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 9245 Highway 33, Westley, \nCalifornia, 95387 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous \nammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the \nlocal fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact \nof the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has \nbeen developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\n? The primary activity at the Facility is the storage and sale of fertilizer.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 1 above ground \ntank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is \n54,250 pounds.\n    \n3.    The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n    a.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to \nthe greatest amount would release 54,250 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which \nrepresents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by \nregulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.71 \nmiles. The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or \nthe most likely potential incident) is a release from a 3 inch diameter hose.  The \ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \n\"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handli"

Five-year Accident History\n    \n\n? There have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous or \nregulated pesticides in the past five years that:\n\n     have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \nfacility; nor\n\n     have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \nproperty  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n6.    The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the \nfollowing regulations:\n\n     *    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     *    OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n\n     *    Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations \nare performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no \nadditional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia process at the \nfacility.\n\n"
