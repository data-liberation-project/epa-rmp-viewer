If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the \nlocal fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact \nof the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has \nbeen developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.\tFacility Information\n\n? The primary activity at the Facility is the storage and sale of fertilizer.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n? Anhydrous ammonia is received by tanker truck and stored in 1 above ground \ntank at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is \n54,250 pounds.\n\t\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\ta.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to \nthe greatest amount would release 54,250 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which \nrepresents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by \nregulations.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.71 \nmiles. The alternative release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or \nthe most likely potential incident) is a release from a 3 inch diameter hose.  The \ndistance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.20 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \nSafety Requirements for Storage and Handli"
