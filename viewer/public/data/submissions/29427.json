      "SummaryText": "On November 3, 4, & 5, 2003, in preparation for the start-up of the new Ammonia refrigeration system at the Farmer John Distribution Center at 3163 E. Vernon Ave., Vernon, CA 90085, AmeriCold Logistics, LLC implemented the government programs; Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Planning (RMP). AmeriCold Logistics will manage and operate the facility.\n\nThe PSM program was audited for completeness and deficiencies were noted and the timing for mitigation was implemented.  Being that this is a new facility deficiencies issues were few.  Most consisted of contractor \"punch list\" Items that will be completed prior to start up.\n\nUpon completion of the PSM, the RMP program was completed.  The RMP team (David Hay, Wayne Isaac, Tom Kelley, and Mike Elliott who are all knowledgeable in the process) found the construction of the facility and the conventional ammonia refrigeration system to be very sound and safe.  The Process Hazard Analysis was found to be in good order.  The 13 elements of the PSM program were reviewed and found to be in good order.  Ammonia release scenarios were formulated for a worst case and an alternate case; the findings were for the alternate case the with a release of 6000 pounds in 60 minutes, the distance to the toxic end point is .10 miles and affects a population 00 residents and 3 commercial receptors.  The worst case consisted of a 4,701-pound release lasting 10 minutes; the toxic end point is .40 miles, effecting 0 residents, 0 housing units, 0 sensitive receptors and numerous commercial receptors."
