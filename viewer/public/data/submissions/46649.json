This focus is evident by the manner in which we have organized our business.  We have an entire staff at the corporate level whose main focus is to ensure our operations are operating in a safe and responsible manner.  They accomplish this by their comprehensive development programs, which cover such areas as design, installation, procedures, and process safety reviews.  Scott is committed to accident prevention and preparedness.  This can be seen through our Emergency Response Programs.  Each Scott location has an emergency response team who is trained to respond to any onsite or offsite accidental release of our products.  Scott is also a member of the Compressed Gas Associations COMPGEAP (Compressed Gas Association Emergency Action Plan) program.  This program is a voluntary alliance with all the major gas manufacturers in the country.  This alliance is a joint agreement to aid and assist any gas related accidental release within our area.  This program allows Scott to react quickly to any offsite difficulties we may encounter.  It also allows Scott to draw from the vast knowledge gained from other companies' experience to assist with problem areas onsite as well.\r\n\r\nScott Medical Products primary activity is the repackaging of high quality medical grade gases.  The regulated substance on our facility is Propane [CAS 74-98-6].  This product is repackaged from our bulk storage into small containers and is used by our customers as a fuel source for their instruments.  We have one large storage tank and two small storage tanks for a total capacity of 7,000 gallons (29,000 lbs.).\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for the Propane process was modeled using the OCA Guidance.  The scenario assumed a sudden release of the large tank.  The tank holds 29,000 lbs. of product.  The product was said t"

This yielded a distance to endpoint of one psig of 0.22 miles.  Within this distance are several light industrial buildings that could be affected. Approximately 200 personnel could be affected during normal business hours.  For this scenario to take place, a breach in the tank would have to take place.  These tanks are well constructed, fenced off and well maintained.  For these reasons, it is very unlikely that the tank shell could be compromised.\r\n\r\nThe OCA Guidance was also used for the alternate release scenario to determine the estimated distance to a one-psig over-pressurization for a flammable vapor cloud explosion.  This yielded an over-pressurization distance of 0.11 miles.  There are approximately one hundred and fifty personnel that could be affected during normal business hours.  The presence of safety shutoff vales and pump cutoff switches makes this scenario very unlikely.\r\n\r\nScott Specialty Gases, Inc.'s prevention program provides an extensive training syllabus which includes supervised training as well as practical testing.  Normal safe operating procedures as well as emergency shut down procedures are followed and are available whenever the process is being operated.  These procedures ensure that the process is performed in a consistent manner in accordance with all safety guidelines.  All preventative and unscheduled maintenance is recorded and tracked for trends and proper operation.  Properly trained and qualified technicians carry out these maintenance tasks to ensure completeness and mechanical integrity.  Records of all trained personnel are kept on file and are current.\r\n\r\nScott's safety record is outstanding.  There has not been an accidental release at this facility for the covered process.\r\n\r\nAll Emergency response personnel are thoroughly trained in the proper procedures"

This training includes emergency evacuation procedures and drills, tabletop exercises, what if scenarios, etc.  All ER personnel are required to undergo a forty-hour hazard materials training class and a sixteen-hour refresher each subsequent year to be considered an active member of the team.  The training includes incident command procedures, emergency remediation of the hazards, joint communications with local authorities and site & personnel decontamination.\r\n\r\nAt this time, there are no significant changes resulting from any findings of our process.  Scott is committed to continuous improvement and will be auditing our process on a continual basis for improvements."
