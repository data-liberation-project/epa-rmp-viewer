Any areas of improvement that can be identified in audits, hazard analyses and inspections are identified and corrective actions are taken in the event a recommendation is made promptly."

      "SummaryText": "-gallon capacity aboveground storage tanks (AST). The ASTs supply a common ammonia vaporizer assembly (containing three individual vaporizers), which is used to pressurize the headspace of the ASTs and supply liquid ammonia downstream to an ammonium hydroxide (aqua ammonia) mixing skid (DS-MX01). Here, anhydrous ammonia is mixed with water to produce an ammonium hydroxide solution that has an ammonia concentration of less than 20%, by weight.  The ammonium hydroxide skid is also provided a dedicated heat exchanger to control the temperature of the ammonium hydroxide.  Due to the fact that the ammonium hydroxide being produced has an ammonia concentration of less than 20% (which is the threshold concentration for aqua ammonia\u0092s inclusion in the RMP regulation), process equipment downstream of the heat exchanger is not considered part of the RMP-covered battery desulfurization process. \n\nFacility summary of Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan Programs: \n- Employee Participation - Employees are given shared responsibility with management in the continued evolution of the program.\n- Process Safety Information - Chemical, equipment, and system information has been compiled to ensure the safe design and operation (flue gas desulfurization and battery desulfurization processes).\n- Process Hazard Analysis - What-if Checklist completed to identify potential hazards and minimize their impact.\n- Operating Procedures - Standard Operating Procedures developed to ensure the safe operation of the process.\n- Training - Training program established and operators trained to ensure the safe operation of the process.\n- Contractors - Contractor program established to ensure only qualified and trained contractor work on or near the process.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review - Procedures and checklist developed to ensure all safety requirements completed before startup of new or modified process.\n- Mechanical Integrity - Program developed to ensure equipment and systems installed per"

      "SummaryText": "Purpose\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to learn of the potential hazards an ammonia release can cause and to give tools to determine what to do in the event of a release.\n \nScope\nSafety Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of the verification of Risk Management Program Requirements.\n\nExecutive Summary\nHealth and safe work environments for employees are Sanders Lead Company's main priorities.  This facility has strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous release.  The Process Safety Management Program is a facility and personnel driven document imbedded in the Sanders Lead Company culture to ensure the surrounding community and employees are protected.  The requirements set by OSHA's PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 is integrated in the Risk Management's Prevention Program, including 14 PSM elements.  The facility has committed to completing audits and inspections as well as holding employee meetings to establish current procedures, ensure there is employee buy in for procedures and seek new opportunities for improvement to health and safety policies.  In the event of an emergency, the facility will evacuate or shelter in place depending upon factors of the emergency due to the facility use of bulk anhydrous ammonia chemical.  \n\nSanders Lead's initial ammonia-based RMP covered process and associated submission in CDX was completed in 2019 (flue gas desulfurization process, Process ID: 1000144442).  In 2023-2024, Sanders designed and installed an additional ammonia-based RMP covered process (battery desulfurization process, Process ID: 1000144443).  Both of these processes are designated as RMP Program Level 3.  Due to the fact that the processes are separate and independent of one another, documents (including PSM/RMP related records) for each covered process are retained separately.\n\nBulk anhydrous ammonia for the battery desulfurization process is stored in two (2) 30,000"
