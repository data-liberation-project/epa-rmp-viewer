Propane and N-Butane are flammable gases under ambient conditions. The release of propane or N- Butane to the atmosphere results in a vapor cloud that could easily ignite and explode.  It is Gemini Aerosols\u00bf policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees as well as members of the surrounding community.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe facility is an aerosol packaging facility.  Several different paint and paint related products are packaged for shipment. In addition, some specialty products such as liquid grease and silk plant cleaners are also packaged for shipment. Propane, Isobutane, and N-Butane are used as propellants for the packaging of aerosol products. \n \nThe regulated substances stored and used at the facility are propane, isobutane, and N-Butane.  The maximum amount of propane that is stored at the facility is 23,000 pounds, the maximum amount of N-Butane that is stored is 17,280 pounds, and the maximum amount of Isobutane is 10,000.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a storage tank when filled to the greatest allowable amount of propane would result in the release of 23,000 pounds of propane.  Gemini Aerosols complies with NFPA code and limits tank filling to 88% capacity.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents are released, a vapor cloud forms, and the vapor reaches an ignition source resulting in an explosion. EPA's RMP Comp software version 1.07 was used to perform Consequence Analysis to determine the distanc"

The facility is located in an industrial park and therefore there is no residential population in the within the impacted area. No environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area. There is a printing company (with 97 employees) and a distribution warehouse (with 2 employees) within the impact distance. \n\nAlternative Scenario - Failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch transfer hose during tank filling.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released.  The resulting vapor cloud travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is less than 528 feet. This release scenario has the possibility of extending beyond the site boundary.  There are no residences within the impact area and no environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  The plant was designed and constructed according to NFPA-58.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe plant has never had an accidental release of propane, isobutane or N-Butane.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nGemini Aerosols is included in a written community emergency response plan. Gemini Aerosols has a written emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Representatives from the local Fire Department and LEPC visited the plant on May 23, 2006. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nGemini Aerosols will continue to comply with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule."
