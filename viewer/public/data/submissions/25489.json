Emergency Response Policies\nThe emergency response policies are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Section of the White River Dome Compressor Station RMP manual for the carbon dioxide removal, Jewell-Thompson (J-T) skid, and liquid hydrocarbon storage processes. PSC takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals.  PSC has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nb. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe White River Dome Compressor Station processes approximately eight mmscf/day of coal bed methane gas.  The station provides compression, dehydration, carbon dioxide extraction, and recovery of liquid hydrocarbon compounds.  The facility uses a two-stage permeable membrane carbon dioxide extraction plant to remove both carbon dioxide and water from the inlet gas.  Hydrocarbons that diffuse through the first membrane with the carbon dioxide are recovered when this \"permeate\" stream is sent through a second permeable membrane at a higher pressure.\n\nThe station has two 30,000 gallon hydrocarbon product tanks, with a maximum intended inventory of 151,800 pounds in each.  There is also one 12,000 gallon condensate tank with a maximum intended inventory of 60,720 pounds.  Filling of the tanks is administratively limited to 80% of tank capacity by NFPA 58 requirements, as corrected for facility elevation.\n\nThe RMP-regulated portion of the facility includes carbon dioxide removal, the J-T skid, and liquid hydrocarbon storage.  \n\nThis is a re"

Initially, White River Dome was a Program Level I facility; however, due to construction of a gas processing facility within the radius of the worst case release, it is now a Program Level II facility.\n\nc. Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario has been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one of the 30,000 gallon hydrocarbon product tanks or 151,8000 pounds) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion) was determined to be 0.4 miles using the EPA RMP Comp program.  There are no residences,  or environmental receptors within a 0.4  mile radius around the facility; however there is a gas processing facility within this distance\n\nThe alternative release scenario has been determined to be a release of the entire contents (151,800 pounds) from one of the 30,000 gallon hydrocarbon products through the relief valve. Due to the size of the relief valve and the remote location of the facility, it was determined that the entire contents of a tank could be vented before an employee could get to the facility to address a malfunction. No active mitigation devices were considered to influence the release scenario. The maximum relief valve capacity was used to determine the volume of hydrocarbon product that would release in sixty minutes.  The distance to the flammable endpoint is the same as the worst-case release scenario (0.4 miles).\n\nd. Prevention Steps for Hydrocarbon Product and Natural Gas Condensate\nThe pre"

Process safety information, which has been collated into the White River Dome RMP manual located at the Meeker Service Center\n?

Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the White River Dome RMP program.  The initial RMP audit was conducted in September 2001 and all changes recommended by the audit have been completed.\n\ne. Accident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there was one accidental release of regulated flammable materials meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42. On December 26, 2001,  while performing maintenance on a leased compressor unit, a flash fire of vapors occurred. One Xcel Energy employee and a contract employee (that worked for the leasing supply company) received first and second degree burns. Medical treatment consisted of using burn cream and follow-up medical visits. The cause of the flash fire was attributed to human error  and cold temperatures.  After the incident the vent system of the leased equipment was modified to prevent vapor collection and additional training was provided to Xcel Energy employees. The leased unit is expected to be removed from the facility before May 1, 2002.\n\nf. Emergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The program is described  in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the White River Dome Compressor Station RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\ng. Planned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical and process "

      "SummaryText": "safety issues are held regularly at the Meeker Service Center.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the White River Dome RMP program, a process hazard analysis was conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes."
