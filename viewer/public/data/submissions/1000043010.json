It is for this reason CMR is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the development and implementation of a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is the policy of CMR to implement appropriate controls to prevent releases of hazardous substances so that the health and safety of employees and the surrounding community and environment is maintained.\r\n\r\nCMR has employees at the refinery that are trained in emergency response to effectively respond to incidents involving hazardous substances.  In order to provide an effective and coordinated response, the plan is coordinated with the City of Great Falls Fire and Rescue, who may be called upon to provide assistance in emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency response drills are conducted periodically to exercise procedures for mitigating the effects of releases of hazardous substances.  Additions and improvements to procedures and equipment are made based on assessment of the drills.  \r\n\r\nCMR is represented on the Cascade County Local Emergency Planning Committee LEPC and has in place a community action panel, consisting of 20 members of the community, for communicating information and concerns between the public and CMR.  \r\n\r\nCMR invites local health care providers, including hospitals and ambulance services, to attend awareness seminars on some of the hazardous chemicals present at the facility, and has provided the local hospital with information on hazardous chemicals to aid in"

There are 12 substances regulated under the Risk Management Program rule present in covered processes at the facility, as follows: Butane, Isobutane, Propane, Isopentane, Propylene, Pentane, Butane, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-trans, 2-Butene-cis, Ethane, and Hydrogen fluoride/hydrofluoric acid.  These substances may occur in the pure form as well as in mixtures.  With the exception of hydrofluoric acid, which is a toxic material, all substances are flammable.  These substances have the potential to present a hazard to employees and the public should an accidental release occur.\r\n\r\n3.\tDetermination of the Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s).\r\n\r\nCMR is required to conduct an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in order to determine a worst case release scenario for both regulated toxic substances as a class and regulated flammable substances as a class that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint, which represents the distance from a release that the public or environment could be subject to serious impacts.  The worst-case release scenarios and respective release quantities are specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Risk Management Program rule, and represent incidents that are considered unlikely.  In the OCA, CMR must also determine an alternative release scenario for both classes of substances mentioned above.  The alternative scenarios and respective re"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.  These elements are identical to those set out in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, with which CMR has been in compliance since 1992.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCMR maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees overseeing or maintaining processes, and is updated based upon the results of hazard analyses, as well as employee participation.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nCMR periodically conducts a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) on each process covered under the RMP rule to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled appropriately and effectively.  The methodology used to conduct each PHA is the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis, supplemented by Checklists.  Both methodologies are approved and effective means of identifying hazards within processes.  The analyses of each covered process are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at five-year intervals.  All findings and recommendations related to the hazard analysis are evaluated, tracked, and resolved in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor t"

The information is reviewed regularly and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nCMR has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Employees are tested to document their understanding of the training given.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years, or more frequently as appropriate.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nCMR carries out documented maintenance checks and inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel with training in appropriate maintenance practices; personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks and inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at CMR to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
