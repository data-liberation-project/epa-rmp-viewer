EAST PLANT\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\nRainSweet, Inc. is a cooperative owned Wilamette Valley based, fruit and vegetable processor with plants in Salem, Oregon.  RainSweet Inc. East Plant processes fresh fruits and vegetables from our growers into frozen fruits and vegetables for human consumption.  Anhydrous ammonia, used as a refrigerant in the freezing process, is located at this facility and is an invaluable component in our fruit and vegetable processing.  RainSweet is aware anhydrous ammonia requires certain safe handling precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure reducing the threat to our employee's health as well as the health of our neighbors and the community.  \nOSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM) regulations are defined by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  EPA's Risk Management Program is defined in Section 112R of the Clean Water Act (40 CFR 68).  These regulations estabish the requirements of both the PSM and RMP programs for facilities that are either specifically designated by the rules or for facilities that possess certain chemicals in excess of threshold quantities.  Ammonia is the chemical used at this facility in quantities that trigger the RMP rquirements.  The RMP program further assigns various program levels to facilities with specific Standard Industry Codes (SIC's).  Frozen fruit and vegetable processors are designated as Program level 3 facilities because they are identified as SIC 2037 industries.\nUnder these regulations, facilities are required to develop a complex multi-element safety program for related systems and plant operations as well as, under the RMP rules, an analysis of the off-site consequences that could result from a catastrophic release.\nMajor task defined in these reguations address the following areas:\n1. Employee Participation                9. Process Hazard Analysis\n2. Process Safety Information          10. Hot Work Permits\n3. Mechanical Integrity   "

Trade Secrets\n\nFacility Background - RainSweet, Inc.\n   \nFacility Siting and Human Factors\nRainSweet Inc, East plant is located in an industrial zone in northeast Salem, Oregon, about one mile east of the Williamette River.  The single plant building covers about 106,000 square feet on 8.2 acres of property.  The plant building has been expanded over the years and houses fruit and vegetable processing equipment, two compressor rooms, five freeze tunnels and two cold storage rooms.  The property, although within two blocks of residential areas, is bordered by industrial and commercial properties on all sides.  Several factors, including facility siting and human factors, were considered during the preparation of the facility's Process Hazard Analyses and the Offsite Consequence reviews.\n\nChemicals and Processes\nRainSweet Inc. East plant uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant to operate the refrigeration components and the system has a total capacity that exceeds the EPA reporting threshold.  This requires the facility to have the proper OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Plan programs in place. The system includes: two engine rooms that house compressors and controls, and condensers, high pressure receivers located outside the building, intercoolers, evaporators, low pressure receivers, (2) cold storage rooms, five freeze tunnels, located in process areas, and necessary interconnecting piping within the system. \n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis\nQualified facilities must conduct multiple offsite consequence analyses (OCA's) and report, to the government and to the public, the potential consequences of the accid"

      "SummaryText": "ental release scenarios studied.  A typical OCA consists of two elements; a worst-case scenario and an alternate release scenario.  The EPA has defined a worst-case release scenario as the rapid release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance, from a single point, that could result in the greatest distance to an endpoint during weather conditions most apt to augment the plume distance.  An alternate scenario is defined as a release that also reaches an endpoint offsite, but is more likely to occur that the worst-case scenario.  A chemical's endpoint is defined as the distance a chemical cloud could travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures should no longer occur.  The distances to the various endpoints may be determined using sophisticated computer models or from the more conservative lookup tables provided by the EPA.  Scenarios for this facility were determined using the EPA's lookup tables.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nWhile it is not believed that a release of the magnitude required by the RMP program criteria would likely occur, RainSweet Inc, East plant, has chosen to assume their worst case scenarios would be a rapid release of the high pressure receiver of the plant's refrigeration system.  We have assumed this would result from mechanical impact and damage although this scenario is improbable due to the location of the high pressure receiver.  Factors limiting the potential for this magnitude of a release include the location of the receivers away from normal traffic areas and safeguards such as operating guidelines, maintenance, policies, and procedures.  In accordance with the RMP rules, worst-case scenarios are based on a fixed set of weather factors that would accentuate the distance a chemical plume would travel.  Based on historical weather data, actual weather conditions for this area would likely decrease the extent of the endpoint of this chemical from the reported table-top exercise.\n\nAlternate Scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o\nThe required release determined for the alternate, more likely to occur, scenario would involve a release of ammonia from one of the system's pressure relief valves, resulting in a significantly smaller release than the worst-case.  This release scenario was felt more likely to occur in the future than the worst-case.  It was assumed that the relief valves in question would  be located on one of the compressor oil separators.  In reality a release would most likely be contained on-site and/or not affect anything off-site.  As part of the facility's maintenance guidelines, the plant has a valve maintenance program that would further decrease the likelihood of a significant release.\n\nAccident Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\nThe safety of our employees and our neighbors depends on the manner in which our employees handle our chemicals as well as our standard operating and maintenance guidelines and the safeguards we utilize at our facility.  RainSweet practices and adheres to state and federal safety regulations including: confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work permits, safe chemical handling, and emergency response programs.  Contractors are also required to adhere to these rules and regulations.  All employees are informed of the chemicals used at the plant and any risks that may be associated with those chemicals.  Material Safety Data Sheets are available to every employee if there is any question as to the proper precautions that should be observed in the handling of the chemicals.  Any RainSweet employee that handles chemicals as part of their job function is further trained in the proper handling of those chemicals.  Accesses to chemical storage areas are restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nRainSweet Inc.

The plant's emergency plan describes the procedures to be followed by our employees during an emergency including evacuations and notifications of management and governmental agencies.  In the case of a release of a toxic chemical that could reach off the facility's property, local emergency response agencies would be immediately notified of the release.  Communications between the plant's Emergency Response Coordinator and the local emergency responders regarding such factors as the chemical released, extent of the release, and wind direction will determine the need for evacuation.  Notification and evacuations of neighbors will be conducted by the local emergency responders.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe RMP program requires that all releases of a criteria chemical which occurred within the previous five years and caused any damages, injuries or evacuation off-site, be reviewed.  One minor release occured on 1/9/07, but with no injuries. The plant personnel conducted the proper agency notifications, conducted an incident investigation, and completed the necessary follow through steps.  OSHA reviewed the release and action taken the following day.\n\nSummary\nAt RainSweet, protecting the community and the environment are high priorities.  RainSweet accepts responsibility for maintaining and operating facilities that are an asset to the community in which they are located.  This responsibility includes taking reasonable steps toward protection against injuries or environmental contamination and damage.  Equipment and procedures at this plant are inspected continuously and environmental protection programs reviewed periodically to assure operation within established guidelines.
