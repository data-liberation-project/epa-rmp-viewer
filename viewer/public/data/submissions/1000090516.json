This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility is utilized to separate free liquids from the local incoming pipeline and recompress the vapors that are gathered from the local equipment. High pressure gas, 1,050 psig, enters the facility and is initially heated to aid in keeping the inlet gas above HC dew point. By raising the temperature of the inlet stream more flow is allowed to bypass the separation equipment and proceed to the downstream gas plant saving horsepower requirements at the local compressors. \n\n\n\nNot all of the inlet stream is heated above HC dew point. This will result in liquids entering the system and being separated out and directed to the downstream separators via the slug catcher. The liquids are then further heated to aid in the prevention of freezing, during the pressure let down phase from 1,050 psig to 105 psig. Liquids are further separated from light (HC's) to heavy (water), and sent to storage where they will be measured and pumped into the nearby pipelines. Vapors will be compressed back to 1,050 psig and reintroduced back into the front of the Barstow Delivery Facility, where they will go back through the slug catcher and onto the vapor pipeline to the gas plant. \n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains one source of a regul"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process a"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nCrestwood primarily used the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) technique to perform this evaluation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Barstow Delivery Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nBarstow Delivery Facility maintains"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Barstow Delivery Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Barstow Delivery Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility uses approved contractors for specialized services during maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Crestwood has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nCrestwood conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Barstow Delivery Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nCrestwood has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include, (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) a"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nCrestwood promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Crestwood periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted on a periodic basis.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Preven"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Barstow Delivery Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility  has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure indicators \n\n3.    High/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\n4.    On call personnel available 24 hours per day.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1.    Berms around tanks\n\n2.    Process relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\n\n3.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n4.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n\n6.    Total plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1.    Standard personal protective equipment (e.g., FR clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, safety toe boots)\n\n2.    SPCC Plan\n\n3.    Fire extinguishers\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possib"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Barstow Delivery Facility is coordinated with the Ward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Hon. Greg Holly is the contact for the LEPC (432-943-3200). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Barstow Delivery Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Crestwood operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Monahans County Sheriff).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emer"
