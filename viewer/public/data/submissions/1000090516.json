This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Crestwood has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nCrestwood conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nCrestwood has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Barstow Delivery Facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Barstow Delivery Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility uses approved contractors for specialized services during maintenance or construction activities.

Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility is utilized to separate free liquids from the local incoming pipeline and recompress the vapors that are gathered from the local equipment. High pressure gas, 1,050 psig, enters the facility and is initially heated to aid in keeping the inlet gas above HC dew point. By raising the temperature of the inlet stream more flow is allowed to bypass the separation equipment and proceed to the downstream gas plant saving horsepower requirements at the local compressors. \r\n\r\nNot all of the inlet stream is heated above HC dew point. This will result in liquids entering the system and being separated out and directed to the downstream separators via the slug catcher. The liquids are then further heated to aid in the prevention of freezing, during the pressure let down phase from 1,050 psig to 105 psig. Liquids are further separated from light (HC's) to heavy (water), and sent to storage where they will be measured and pumped into the nearby pipelines. Vapors will be compressed back to 1,050 psig and reintroduced back into the front of the Barstow Delivery Facility, where they will go back through the slug catcher and onto the vapor pipeline to the gas plant. \r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process a"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCrestwood primarily used the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability) technique to perform this evaluation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Barstow Delivery Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nBarstow Delivery Facility maintains"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Barstow Delivery Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility  has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1.\tTanks are gauged\r\n2.\tTanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure indicators \r\n3.\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\r\n4.\tOn call personnel available 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.\tBerms around tanks\r\n2.\tProcess relief valves venting vapors to the atmosphere or flare to prevent vessels from rupturing\r\n3.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\r\n4.\tAutomated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\r\n5.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation \r\n6.\tTotal plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system \r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.\tStandard personal protective equipment (e.g., FR clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, safety toe boots)\r\n2.\tSPCC Plan\r\n3.\tFire extinguishers\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Barstow Delivery Facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

      "SummaryText": "ility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Barstow Delivery Facility is coordinated with the Ward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The Hon. Greg Holly is the contact for the LEPC (432-943-3200). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Barstow Delivery Facility has around-the-clock communications capability.  Crestwood operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.  The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Monahans County Sheriff).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emer"
