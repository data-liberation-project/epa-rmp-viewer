Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific employees within the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility primarily uses the \"HAZOP\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews "

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThere are no specific operating procedures for the facility since the railroad companies perform all transfers of railcars. The employee at the site only works part-time and only has minor maintenance procedures associated with the track.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training in Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are awa"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews (PSR)\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. A PSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Ridgelawn Rail Storage Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.
