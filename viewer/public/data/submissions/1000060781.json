Program to address the accident prevention program requirements for both the EPA and OSHA regulations. The purpose of the PSM/RMP Program is to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, tied together by a management system to ensure development, implementation, and integration of the program requirements. These elements consist of the following: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Trade Secrets, and Emergency Planning and Response. Reddy Ice has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan (?EAP?), which includes procedures for emergency notifications and safe evacuation of personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nReddy Ice is committed to operating a safe and regulatory compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. The Reddy Ice-Gaffney facility is designed with multiple safeguards pertinent to the closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system, including normal and emergency ventilation systems, emergency controls that shut down the equipment if operating limits are exceeded, and computerized PLC controls for system operation. Refrigerant leak detection units and associated alarms are installed throughout the facility to notify employees or offsite personnel in the event of a fugitive ammonia release.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "The Reddy Ice-Gaffney (435) facility, located at 130 Peoples Creek Rd., Gaffney, SC 29340, operates a closed-circuit mechanical refrigerating system that utilizes anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) as a refrigerant for manufacture and storage of packaged ice for wholesale and retail distribution. Ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe, reliable, and efficient refrigerant. However, due to a moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a highly hazard chemical.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nReddy Ice is committed to operating a safe and regulatory compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. Incidents involving ammonia can be reduced through proper implementation of employee training, the development of a knowledge base of the equipment, and the development, implementation, and maintenance, of effective operating and maintenance procedures for all ammonia equipment. To reduce the risk of ammonia incidents, Reddy Ice-Gaffney has developed a combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (\"PSM/RMP\") Program to meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") and the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") regulations.\n\nThe purpose of the PSM/RMP Program is to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. The PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, which work together to establish an incident free culture. These elements consist of the following guidelines: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Contractor, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Trade Secrets, and Emergency Planning and Response. \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RMP Program elements. The Plant Manager has the overall responsibility"

Under the PSM/RMP Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals as applicable. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nReddy Ice-Gaffney has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (\"OCAs\") for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative-case release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nReddy Ice has developed a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\"), which includes procedures for emergency notifications, employee training, and safe evacuation of personnel. The EAP is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders, and has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders in the event of an emergency. The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the facility is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nReddy Ice-Gaffney has not had any ammonia releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\n\nReddy Ice-Gaffney operates a closed-circuit ammonia refrigeration system that was designed and installed according to local building and fire codes and the applicable recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (\"RAGAGEP\") at time of con"
