CDI's program consists of Hazard Analysis's and Auditing of its processes that involve hazardous or toxic chemicals.  Through employee training and constant monitoring and maintenance of internal equipment, CDI strives to eliminate the possibility of any off-site impact that may occur.  This includes in many cases maintaining much smaller inventory levels, strict adherence to the Department of Transportation's performance packaging requirements and working with local safety organizations such as the Buffalo Fire Department and the Buffalo Sewer Authority in the design and construction of our buildings.  CDI has also established a new Security Plan to address potential security threats at both the facility and during transport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CDI approaches accidental release prevention with the attitude of eliminating any potential sources.  CDI is always looking for and developing new ways and ideas to minimize opportunities for releases before they occur. CDI utilizes quality suppliers and manufacturers in the field as a source of technical expertise as well as products.  Working closely with these suppliers and manufacturers allows us the ability to gather and utilize an increasing amount of safety ideas and methods that can be put into action to improve our release prevention program.  CDI's Senior Management Team believes that safety is our top priority and spares no resources to obtain and maintain the highest level obtainable in our field.  We have an ongoing commitment to the public and the environment to make the industry a safe place that we can all be proud o"

In our facility, we supply our customers with exactly what they require and when they need it to keep them running efficiently 24 hours a day.  In conjunction with the Buffalo Fire Department and the University of Buffalo's Chemical Engineering Department, we have the ability to safely store a wide array of products and equipment.  Some products stored at our facility are concentrated versions of household cleaners used at an industry level for various water treatment and metal finishing operations.  Other chemicals that are stored in bulk quantities as well as drum or smaller quantities may include metal finishing and plating products and pH control chemicals for treating water. \n\nCDI analyzes any potential conditions that may occur that would result in a release that would in turn involve public receptors.  This activity is referred to as a \"Worst Case Scenario\" study.  With this study in hand and the information received from it, we can adapt our business to minimize the off-site impact on public receptors. All this information was calculated using an EPA modeling system called EPA RMPCOMP?.  These are formulas developed by the EPA to assist in the determination of off-site impact.  Some of the efforts made by CDI to limit this event include diking of the entire building to prevent any loss of liquid outside the premises.  In addition, all activities performed are 100% manned operations.  CDI does not have any unattended operations thus reducing the potential for a release.  Both of the chemicals listed in this report are kept in the smallest package containers possible to limit the amount of an accidental release. \n\nCDI complies with all of the government regulations that deal with the safe storage and handling of chemical products.  The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as well as the United States Environmental Protection Agency dictate pract"

CDI takes pride in the training of it's employees on the many aspects of chemical awareness.  Drills are periodically conducted to evaluate the situational integrity of the plans.  From this CDI can constantly improve their emergency preparedness plans.\n\nCDI maintains in it's Emergency Response Plan, set procedures on whom to notify in the event of a release.  All phone numbers of government agencies as well as responding cleanup personnel are clearly documented and kept on file.  Recently, the NYS DEC conducted an audit checking the soundness of the plan as well as the storage practices for the products kept at CDI and concluded the storage facility is maintaining proper safety practices.\n\nCDI has recently upgraded it's facility to met new storage regulations including new secondary containment diking in the chemical storage areas and transfer stations as well as the addition of high level alarms.  The newly revised transfer stations are composed of specially treated concrete formed into catch basin areas that will contain the entire contents of a bulk trailer delivery.  Should a leak occur, the product will be contained and be able to be reclaimed without danger to the public or the environment.\n\nCDI is a member company in good standing of the National Association of Chemical Distributors and as such is required to abide by its guiding principles which include Safety, Health and Environmental standards.\n\nAll of these processes incorporated by CDI, help make the Chemical Industry as a whole, a safer facet of the business environment.
