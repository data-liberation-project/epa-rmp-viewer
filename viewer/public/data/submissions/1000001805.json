On June 11, 2004 the system was \"charged\" with 13,787 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. When the original EPA RMP submission was filed on June 8, 2004 the system had not had anhydrous ammonia introduced into it and the quantity was calculated to be 14,692 pounds; however, the initial charge was slightly less being 13,787 pounds.\n\nDue to the fact that the facility CAPP program was required to be completed and submitted with a Permit to Construct Application to the State, the complete Program was developed and the Process Hazard Analysis was performed beginning on June 23, 2003 and ending on June 27, 2003. The application for a Permit to Construct was submitte\nto The State on August 7, 2003 and supplemented on December 5, 2003. On January 23, 2004, a Permit to Construct was issued by The State and construction of the ammonia refrigeration system was started. At the completion of the refrigeration system construction, final inspection and checks, The State gave approval on June\n2004 to introduce anhydrous ammonia into the system. On June 11, 2004 anhydrous ammonia was introduced into the ammonia refrigeration system for the first time.\n\nWe consulted with The State and it was agreed that the first PHA revalidation would be five years from the date ammonia was introduced into the system. Therefore, the validation date will be on or before June 11, 2009 and we expect it to be simple since there have been no changes and the facility has not experienced any problems with the\nammonia refrigeration system.\n\nFACILITY PRODUCTION, STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Meadow Gold Dairy facility is located at 6350 E. Centennial Parkway, N. Las Vegas. Meadow Gold produces and distributes very high quality fluid milk and milk products and is equipped with a refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. Ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " is the only regulated substance used at the facility. The ammonia refrigeration system is a very important part in the production and storage of high quality products. The ammonia refrigeration system is used to cool the milk to approximately 34 degrees F. during processing and to maintain the cooler vault at 34 degrees F. during storage.\n\nFIVE YEAR EXPERIENCE\nThe refrigeration system has performed as expected - EXCELLENT. There have not been any incidents or accidents in the first five years of operation.\n\nCAPP / RMP / PSM ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAMS\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated system shutdown if safe parameters are exceeded. These systems are tested annually. Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is equipped with pressure relief valves that would operate to prevent damage to system components should pressure reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves would result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\nThe CAPP / RMP / PSM programs includes very detailed procedures for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, contractor safety, safe work practices, compliance audits, mechanical integrity, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. The Emergency Action Plan has been review and approved by The State and the Fire Department who would be called to respond in the event of an emergency. The facility is equipped with ammonia\nsensors that would alert employees to evacuate if a low level of ammonia should be detected and to automatically notify the Fire Department at a slightly higher level if d"
