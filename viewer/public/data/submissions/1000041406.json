Recommended upgrades from the vulnerability assessment have been implemented; these upgrades should help ensure the security of the WTP and chlorination system.  In addition, an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the water system was completed in December 2004 to provide guidance for threat, disaster, or emergency operations.  The ERP recognizes the presence of chlorine at the WTP and establishes an Action Plan Guide, Threat Management Tree, and response procedures.  In addition, the City has developed an Emergency Operations Plan to address various situations within the community.  \r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan is a tool that provides guidance for the WTP in the day to day operations thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment as well as enhancing the safety of the community."

An RMP is required when chlorine of 2,500 pounds or greater is stored at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The RMP is required to be updated and submitted to the EPA every five years.  The intent of the RMP is to enhance the safety of the community by the preparedness of the City to respond to emergency situations.  This is accomplished by the joint efforts of the police, fire, and public works departments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) is in place.  The PSM is required by OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM is required when chlorine of 1,500 pounds or greater is stored at the WTP.  The PSM and RMP work hand in hand to prevent or minimize exposure to chlorine gas for the safety of Utilities Division employees and residents of Apple Valley.  A compliance audit of the PSM is required every three years and was last completed in February 2013. The Water Treatment Plant was constructed in 1989 and has been safely treating the community's drinking water supply for over 20 years.  Chlorine is used in two phases of the water treatment processes, pre-chlorination and post-chlorination.  In the pre-chlorination process, chlorine is used as an oxidizer to help facilitate bringing the minerals, iron and manganese, out of suspension so they can be removed from the water in the filtration process.  In the post-chlorination process chlorine serves as a disinfectant prior to pumping the water into the distribution system to prevent bacterial growth.  Construction of the WTP significantly reduced the amount of chlorine within the City for water treatment.  Previously chlorine was utilized at each well site.\r\n\r\nAn average of 6.8 million gallons of water are treated each day at the WTP.  The volume of water treated varies seasonally ranging from 3.5 to 4 million gallons per"

      "SummaryText": "day in the winter to more than 18 million gallons per day in the summer.  For each million gallons of water pumped, slightly less than 20 pounds of chlorine are used in the treatment process.  Under normal operating conditions 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in two one-ton chlorine cylinders.  Up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine may be on site during peak summer operating conditions when water demand increases, or when seasonal road restrictions limit shipment deliveries. Beginning in 2010, the chlorine cylinders in use were equipped with an airtight enclosure that increases the safety and security of the chlorine use. \r\n\r\nThe pre and post-chlorination processes utilize a vacuum feed principle that prevents the flow of chlorine if the vacuum is interrupted.  If no vacuum is present on the chlorine feed lines it is impossible for any chlorine demand to be created.  This minimizes the risk of a chlorine release in the event of damage to the chlorine piping system.  Scenarios were modeled to determine potential affected residents and businesses.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires the Apple Valley Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\r\n \r\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\r\n\r\n*The affected population within the influence radius for each described scenario is based on the 2010 Census Data and represents an approximation that is probably higher than actual.  The entire population was counted for each block fully or partially within the radius.\r\n\r\nNo significant chlorine releases have occurred.  Minute amounts of chlorine are infrequently released during the chlorine tank change out process.  Operational procedures outline the steps WTP operators must follow when changing chlorine cylinder"

A daily visual inspection is made of the chlorine room, pre and post- chlorinators, chlorine alarm, chlorine analyzer, and overall facility.  \r\n\r\nSafety is of utmost importance.  Chemical safety training is required to be done annually by the chemical supplier for all Utility Division employees.  Simulated OSHA safety inspections are done periodically by the City's safety consultant.  Respirator and confined space training is done annually for all Utilities Division employees.  Fire Department employees do monthly inspections of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) at the WTP.  In addition, the Fire Department provides annual SCBA training and fit testing for the Utilities Division employees.\r\n\r\nAn emergency backup generator is on site and capable of running the entire facility plus one well during power outages or emergency situations.  \r\n\r\nThe WTP is included in the community emergency response plan.  In the event of a chlorine emergency, the Utilities Division would contact 9-1-1.  The Dakota Communications Center (DCC) is the emergency dispatch contact. The DCC will contact the Fire Department, who would assess the situation and, if necessary, contact the State Duty Officer.  The State Duty Officer would determine if a HAZMAT team needs to be notified.  The Fire Department, Duty Officer, and HAZMAT teams are trained in handling emergency situations involving hazardous materials.  They would also be responsible for mitigating the effects of a release.  The Police Department is also familiar with the site and can provide emergency assistance, in addition to, coordinating evacuation procedures when needed.
