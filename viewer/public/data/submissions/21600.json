The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of UAP Ag Service of Imperial, Nebraska, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na) This facility has been owned and operated by UAP Pueblo since March 18, 1998.  All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb) This primary activity of this facility, as it relates to anhydrous ammonia, is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to growers as fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc) Currently, anhydrous ammonia is reacted with phosphoric acid and water to produce fertilizer.  This reaction, using a on-site t-reactor recently installed.  The installation of this reactor has resulted in  revisions to this and other safety and emergency plans.\n\nd) The maximum quantity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 78,000 pounds.  This represents filling the largest storage tank to 85% of capacity.  There are two large storage tanks on site, along with a number of portable tank trailers used to deliver the anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility either by bu"

      "SummaryText": "lk rail car or bulk truck.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\na) The worst-case scenario is based on the entire contents of a rail car being released over a 10-minute period.  The quantity released would equal approximately 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 1.19 miles.\n\nb) The alternate case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose.  The quantity released would equal approximately 26,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200 ppm) is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na) This facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI publication K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nb) This facility is in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nc) This facility follows the anhydrous ammonia standards established by the Nebraska State Fire Marshal, and is inspected by them at least on an annual basis.\n\nd) This facility is inspected at least monthly by employees knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\na) There have been no accidents in the previous five years involving the release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility, while under management of either UAP Pueblo or Koch Industries.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\na) This facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nb) This facility has provided State and Local authorites the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nc) This facility has a written emergency response plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.120, which includes pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.
