This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nSamson Exploration, LLC, operates the Gheens Refrigeration Facility located at, 1956 Joe Brown Road, Lockport, LA 70374 (lat/long N 29.632574 W 90.456030) in LaFourche Parish, Louisiana. \n\n\n\nThe Gheens sales facility takes a dehydrated stream of natural gas from the main Gheens facility (flow based on DM Minerals #3 well allocation meter) and conditions the gas stream to make it suitable for sales by reducing the C5+ components to below the Gulf South specification of 0.2 gpm.  After bulk liquid separation, moisture content is further reduced by means of glycol dehydration.  Following glycol dehydration the gas stream is sent to a refrigeration skid to recover Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).  Flowrate above the capacity of the refrigeration skid is bypassed and later mixed with treated gas.   Any liquids that are removed from the natural gas stream through a cold separator go to the NGL storage (bullet) tank and are later transported offsite via tanker trucks.  Gas leaving the refrigeration skid is metered and goes to pipeline for sales. Liquid flash from the bullet tank is taken to flare.  \n\n\n\nThe Gheens Refrigeration Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP"

The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nSamson identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances. The identification of this exceedance indicated that the Gheens Refrigeration Facility is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nThis facility processes Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) which are stored in one (1) 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank (91,710 lbs). The facility is subject to RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGLs and contains threshold quantities of regulated substances as indicated in the following table:\n\n\n\nNatural Gas\n\n  Regulated Quantity Percent\n\n           Substance (lbs)     (>1%)\n\nEthane            10,000           4.177    \n\nPropane            10,000          10.234    \n\ni-Butane    10,000           8.8525    \n\nn-Butane    10,000          13.291    \n\ni-Pentane    10,000          11.419    \n\nn-Pentane    10,000           8.925    \n\nMethane         10,000         2.6726\n\n\n\nOnsite lbs = (total gallons) x (lbs/gallons)\n\nNGL lbs = 18,000 x 5.095 = 91,710 lbs  (Note: there is only one vessel onsite so the quantity refers to the quantity in the single largest vessel).\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is NOT required.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced any accidental releases that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42 within the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Lockport Volunteer fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3). Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained in this RMP and these procedures wi"
