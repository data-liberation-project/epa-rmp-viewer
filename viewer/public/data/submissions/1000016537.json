      "SummaryText": "The ITWC, Inc. facility in Malcom, Iowa is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions found in Title 40 part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule (RMP).  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in excess of the regulatory 10,000 pound threshold.  Toluene Diisocyanate (Unspecified Isomer) is used in urethane resin production, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years.  The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity.  The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile the information and materials necessary to submit an updated RMP.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (T100), although the facility also processes a solution of Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate, commonly referred to as 80/20.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that 59,000 pounds of TDI was released to the atmosphere over a 60-minute period.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's ALOHA software program.  The distance at which the TDI concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.58 miles.   It was further determined that within 0.58 miles of the facility there is a population of 352 people, 117 of them living within the threat zone. The public receptors identi"

      "SummaryText": "fied within 2.3 miles of the facility are residences, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas.  \n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were examined. The first release alternative release scenario examined the same vessel as the worst case scenario; however, the quantity released is based on the more realistic normal operating inventory of the vessel rather than the largest quantity that may ever be present in the vessel. In this scenario, 21,935 pounds (current inventory) of TDI was released over a 60-minute period.  The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.36 miles. The population within the threat zone was determined to be 43. The second alternative release scenario examined a release of TDI resulting from a failure of the secondary (smaller) TDI storage tank. This is located in the same building as the vessel as examined in the worst-case release.    In this scenario, 29,000 pounds of TDI was released over a 60-minute period.  The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.41 miles.  The population within the threat zone was determined to be 63.  Residences and a commercial/industrial area were the only public or environmental receptors identified within each scenario."
