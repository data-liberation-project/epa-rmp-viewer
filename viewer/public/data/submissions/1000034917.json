The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community .  The RMP includes the following information:\r\n\r\nIntroduction;\r\nFacility identification and regulated substances;\r\nPolicies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\nHazard Assessment;\r\nPrevention Program;\r\nFive-Year Accident History;\r\nEmergency Response Plan; and\r\nPlanned Changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\r\nSterigenics Grand Prairie operates a contract sterilization facility located in Grand Prairie, Texas.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \r\n\r\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics Grand Prairie.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program \r\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program in"

Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety. Sterigenics has also implemented a mechanical integrity program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, Sterigenics has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire or release from the facility. \r\n\r\nHazard Evaluation\r\nUnder the EPA regulations, Sterigenics is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and an alternate release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "e RMP regulations define a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a) (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case scenario for toxic gases is assumed to be the total release of the single largest container in the process over a 10 minute time period.  Thus, for the Grand Prairie facility, it is assumed that 400 lbs. of ethylene oxide is release over a 10 minute time period. The ethylene oxide cylinders are maintained in an outdoor, fenced staging area prior to use. The staging area is directly exposed to the surrounding atmosphere therefore it is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinders are released to the atmosphere.  The release rate was then calculated and the distance to endpoint was determined.  This distance is beyond the facility fence line.\r\n\r\nAlthough Sterigenics recognizes the maximum potential impacts resulting from a release of ethylene oxide, it believes this scenario to be unlikely.  Sterigenics has implemented extensive safeguards to prevent such a release such as:  computer controls on all sterilizers, interlock alarms associated with each sterilizer, and installation of process area monitors to detect any leaks.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the US EPA OCAG Document, the alternate scenario evaluated was assumed to consist of a leaking valve on a cylinder of ethylene oxide. The leaking valve results in a release of ethylene oxide to the inside of the building, and the vapor cloud is assumed to travel outside and downwind.  This release is assumed to result from a quarter-inch diameter leak from the valve on a 400-lb. vessel pressurized at 50 psig.  The release rate was determined based on Equation 7-1 in the EPA's OCAG document. The cylinder is assumed to be in use during the leak, therefore a 55% mitigation factor was taken into account resulting from containment within a permanent structure.  The rele"

This distance is beyond the facility fence line. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\r\n1.\tThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n2.\tThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\u00a7\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\r\n\u00a7\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nSterigenics has not had any accidental releases from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.  However, Sterigenics did have one release event which ocurred on December 8, 2013.  The amount of EO released was 13.7 lbs over a 11hour and 45 minute period.  No deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place ocurred both on-site and off-site.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nThe RMP regulations require that response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Grand Prairie facility are coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Grand Prairie City Fire Department.\r\n\r\nDepending on the quantity and chemical involved in a reportable spill, Sterigenics also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of Sterigenics activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified. \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Safety\r\nEthylene oxide is stored in an outdoor staging area that is cool,"
