This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions, which address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Maysville Gas Plant facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Maysville Gas Plant has been coordinated with the Garvin, and McClain County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Maysville Gas Plant conducts emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA corporate wide electronic MOC process is being implemented to create a more consistent and comprehensive method for managing changes.  An electronic PSSR process is being implemented to ensure all aspects of physical changes are reviewed for safe and compliant installation prior to startup.  The revalidation PHA was done as a HAZOP in 2015.  Future PHAs will be conducted as HAZOP with LOPA and risk assessment in accordance with new company standards.\n\n\n\n"
