This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe Maysville Gas Plant (Facility), located in Maysville, Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce mixed natural gas liquids  and gasoline condensate petroleum products from natural gas.

In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel\r\nhaving responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry\r\npractice and meet regulatory requirements. Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout,\r\nline breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees\r\nand the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a\r\nrelease to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\r\nOFS has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.\r\nEnsuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n     1.

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions, which address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Maysville Gas Plant facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Maysville Gas Plant has been coordinated with the Garvin, and McClain County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

An electronic PSSR process is being implemented to ensure all aspects of physical changes are reviewed for safe and compliant installation prior to startup.  The revalidation PHA was done as a HAZOP in 2015.  Future PHAs will be conducted as HAZOP with LOPA and risk assessment in accordance with new company standards."
