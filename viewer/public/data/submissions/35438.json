(Producers) utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at their facility in Fresno, California.  It is Producers? policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Producers? objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nAdditionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Producers and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nProducers owns and operates a milk and milk products processing facility located on East Belmont Avenue in Fresno, California.  The corporate office and mailing address is 250 E. Belmont.\n\nThe ammonia-based refrigeration system at Producers provides cooling for the raw milk tanks, the glycol chiller for the pasteurizing process, pasteurized milk tanks, cream tank, cold storage rooms, and the ice makers.  The major components of the refrigeration system are the high pressure receiver, recirculator package, direct expansion evaporators, flooded evaporators, accumulators, compressors, condensers, and water and glycol chillers.\n\nThe largest vessel in the refrigeration system at Producers in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is approximately 35,000 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Producers to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Written process safety information, including informat"

An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n? Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n? Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n? Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n? Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n? A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n? Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n? Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n? Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n? A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n? Hot work permits are issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system.\n\n? A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, Producers has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Operations Manager.  The Operations Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nProducers has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have "

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Producers? employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Producers regularly evaluates the need for any additional changes to improve safety.\n\nAs part of the refrigeration system expansion scheduled to be completed in 2004, Producers implemented several improvements to the refrigeration system to enhance the safety of the system, including the following:\n\n? Installation of a pressure relief header for new and existing equipment.\n\n? Installation of a new ammonia diffusion system with a 33,000 gallon (nominal capacity) water tank.\n\n? Installation of new pressure relief valves.  \n\n? Installation of a visual system (i.e. rupture disk/pressure gauge system) to detect operation of a pressure relief valve(s).  \n\n? Installation of new and relocated equipment foundations designed to current seismic codes."
