      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Ethanol 2000, LLC facility (d/b/a POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake) is located approximately one half mile southwest of Bingham Lake, Minnesota, in Cottonwood County.  POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake's main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  The facility also produces vegetable (corn) oil and dried distillers grain.  Ethanol production at the facility was initiated in July, 1997.   POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake produces ethanol using the dry mill method. Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch resulting in mash.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.  The fermented mash (beer) contains about 20% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol. After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) as per federal and state requirements  to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank Nos. 805 and 802.  The largest unit quantity is stored in Tank 802, which has a capacity of 39,000 gallons (approximately 250,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol via circulation blending in the denatured ethanol storage tanks.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA'S CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation. The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank and the associated transfer/blending equipment and piping. The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 2% to 3%.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the quantity in the larger of the two potential denaturant storage tanks, located in the center containment are"

Line 1.17(c)of this submission is the total quantity of both those tanks (though it is not likely that both tanks would be used at near capacity) plus the amount added to denatured ethanol storage tanks at capacity (also a conservative high estimate).  As recommended by U.S. EPA's RMP Information Office on June 10,  2013, Line 4.4 of the Worst Case Scenario submission is taken as QR (Eq. D-1; Risk Management Program Guidance for Off Site Consequence Analysis, EPA 550-B-99-009, March, 2009.), i.e., pounds released per minute and multiplied times ten minutes to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud explosion.   Similarly, line 5.4 of the Alternative Case Scenario submission is taken as QR for one minute to reflect the quantity that is estimated to evaporate and participate in an un-contained vapor cloud fire.  Details of the calculation methodology are in Appendix D of the POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake Desktop Risk Management Plan.     \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nPOET Biorefining-Bingham Lake is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from industrial materials used in the ethanol fuel production process. The company has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) as per 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  In the event of a chemical  emergency, POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake's Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials. There is no facility emergency response team. Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety. In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake to notify the Windom F"

Computer based maintenance software (Maximo) is utilized to implement automatic scheduling and work order generation for covered process  preventative maintenance inspections and tests.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system. The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors). The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms. Critical aspects of process control can be performed remotely.  The covered process  storage tanks have secondary containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents. There have been no accidents since startup of the facility which require inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE PLANT SAFETY\n\nThere are no current design projects or equipment procurements planned in this category at the time of this submission; however, POET Biorefining-Bingham Lake's management and operations team is committed to an on-going system of production process review, evaluation of improvements in available technology (including safety features), analysis of previous plan"
