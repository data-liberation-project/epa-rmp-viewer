      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the Risk Management Program is to reduce chemical risk at the local level. This information helps local fire, police, and emergency response personnel (who must prepare for and respond to chemical accidents), and is useful to citizens in understanding the chemical hazards in communities. Southern Hens, Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.   It is the policy of Southern Hens, Inc. to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSouthern Hens, Inc. operates a poultry processing plant in two (2) separate buildings (cook plant and kill plant)located at 329 Moselle Seminary Road, Moselle, Mississippi.  Chlorine is used in the treatment of water from a private well prior to entering the plant process, and in the treatment of process wastewater  prior to permitted discharge to the Leaf River.  To reduce the frequency of handling chlorine containers, the onsite chlorine inventory is being increased to 4,000 pounds, stored in two (2), ton containers.  Southern Hens, Inc. also uses anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems  in both buildings fort the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen poultry.  A 9,000 pound ammonia receiver is located at the rear of the kill plant and a 12,000 pound ammonia receiver was recently installed at the rear of the newly constructed cook plant for a potential maximum amount of ammonia stored at the facility of  21,000 pounds. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine is the release of the largest quantity of chlorine in a single vessel.  The entire contents of this vessel are assumed to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  The largest single chlorine vessel at the Southern Hens, Inc. water/wastewater"

The off site consequence of this release scenario was determined using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP*Comp software. The RMP*Comp results indicated a distance to the toxic endpoint of 3.0 miles from the chlorine storage area.  Based on block-level population data obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Census 2000, the estimated residential population within the estimated worst-case distance to toxic endpoint of 3.0 miles is 1,600 residents.  In addition to residences, public receptors within this distance include one (1) school (Moselle Elementary School) and a small power plant/substation.  \nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a vapor release from a sheared valve, or a 1/4 hole in the vapor space of a ton container.  An estimated release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute for a duration of 60 minutes results in a release of 630 pounds of chlorine.  The off site consequence of this release scenario was determined using the EPA RMP*Comp software. The RMP*Comp results indicated a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles from the chlorine storage area.  There were no public receptors identified within this distance to endpoint.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for ammonia is the release of the entire contents of the largest ammonia receiver.

The largest single ammonia vessel at the Southern Hens, Inc. facility is the 12,000 pound receiver located at the rear of the cook plant.  A catastrophic failure would result in the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia as a gas over a 10-minute period.

Southern Hens, Inc. personnel will respond to small leaks and attempt to stop the release.  If the release cannot controlled, response personnel will  initiate plant evacuation procedures and notify the Jones County LEPC and local Fire Department should assistance be needed.  If the release is caused by a leaking 1-ton container and cannot be controlled, emergency response personnel will submerge the leaking container in the wastewater treatment lagoon to minimize exposure.  Ton containers are equipped with six fusible metal plugs, three in each end. The fusible metal is designed to melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature."
