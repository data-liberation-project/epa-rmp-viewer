This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention programs, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our equipment adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe regulated equipment is owned by Ineos and is located at the BP Naperville Campus at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563. The primary purpose of this equipment is to conduct polymer research and development. At present, Ineos has only one process -- the Polypropylene Process-- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk Management Planning requirements. This process contains two flammable regulated substances which are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows: propylene and ethylene. Propylene is stored on site in an outdoor vertical 15,000-gallon tank. The maximum allowable fill volume of the tank is 12,000 gallons, which equates to 53,000 pounds. This is greater than the quantity of ethylene onsite at any given time. The maximum quantity of ethylene stored on site at any time is 12,000 lbs. The propylene tank is located within the facility's 300 Tank Farm. The tank farm has an additional tank, formerly used to store an isobutylene mixture, which is currently out of service and has been filled with low pressure nitrogen. Other parts of the covered process include the polyolefin pilot plant, small polyolefin pilot plant and the flammable liquids shed associated with laboratory operation. Please note that Ineos"

Since this process is also regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, the summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM elements.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nIneos encourages employees who work in the Polypropylene Process to participate in multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in our Employee Participation Plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Polypropylene Process personnel keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Polypropylene Pilot Plant has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Polypropylene Pilot Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters. Polypropylene Process personnel assure that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, operator training, and p"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and operator training, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nIneos has a program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. This process applies to the Polypropylene Pilot Plant. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nIneos primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked to completion.

These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate and may be revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nIneos has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of site entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources while equipment is undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into confined spaces, and (5) a permit and procedure for performing Hot Work in areas that contain flammable materials. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Ineos has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

All training is documented, including the means used to verify operator comprehension.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nIneos uses contractors to supplement maintenance, construction and operation efforts. Ineos has procedures in place to help ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow safety rules, and (6) inform personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting. In addition, Ineos, in conjunction with BP, evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Ineos periodically monitors contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nIneos conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) operator training, (2) written procedures and plans, (3) inspections and tests, and (4) correcting identified deficiencies. In combination, these form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nIneos uses the BP Naperville Complex hot work permit program which details those areas which require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.

This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, etc. be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. The system helps to ensure that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIneos promptly investigates all incidents and near misses that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
