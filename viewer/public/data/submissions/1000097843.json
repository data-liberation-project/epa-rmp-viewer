The Supply Division uses the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Hazard and Operability Study (HazOps) methodology for the review of the regulated substances and processes. Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review updates.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  Written operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures are reviewed on an annual basis and re-certified upon review and/or modification. \r\n\r\nTRAINING:  Supply Division staff, as well as BUCRA corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program is reviewed annual prior to the annual refresher training. The current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n 1. Initial employee training.\r\n 2. Periodic refresher training.\r\n 3. Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification.\r\n 4. Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training.\r\n 5. Training records for each employee.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training.\r\n\r\nRMP MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety"

The Facility RMP Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures. \r\n\r\nPRE START-UP SAFETY REVIEW:  The pre start-up safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre start-up safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre start-up safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. \r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. \r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place. The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:  The Facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations. The Supply Division has an Employee Participation Program in place and has implemented procedures regarding engaging employees for their input, as well as ensuring access to safety documentation to ensure consideration of their knowledge and experience in all applicable areas of the prevention program.\r\n\r\nHOT WORK PERMIT:  With regard to hot work that may occur on or near the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, the Supply Division has developed a writ"
