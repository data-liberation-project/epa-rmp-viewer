Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 O'Neill Vintners & Distillers, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name        |   Process Chemical      |      Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nMain Processing         Anhydrous Ammonia                   27,300\n\n900 Farm                Anhydrous Ammonia                   14,800\n\nSulfur Dioxide          Sulfur Dioxide                       8,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies "

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers is a processing facility for wine and other alcoholic beverages.  The facility has three (3) ammonia systems that provide refrigeration capacity to ten (10) product chillers and a sulfur-dioxide process consisting of ton containers and cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems utilize flooded refrigeration design and operate as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each heat exchanger where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator or directly into the heat exchanger. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator (or shell of the heat exchanger), and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the each system's main suction accumulator where residual liquid can be separated from the vapor. From there the low pressure vapor is piped to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure vapor ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. \n\n\n\nEach of the ammonia systems at O'Neill Vintners & Distillers consists of vessels, valves, equipment which are interconnected by piping to form a closed-loop. The systems are ne"

Therefore, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has three (3) ammonia processes.\n\n\n\nThe sulfur-dioxide process at O'Neill Vintners & Distillers is an integral part of the wine-making process. The process involves four (4) ton containers and several smaller cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide injection process at this facility consists of vessels which are co-located such that a release of sulfur dioxide could impact the ability to operate other vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the sulfur dioxide process is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the O'Neill Vintners & Distillers facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 47,100 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.

The sulfur-dioxide process contains multiple cylinders with a maximum inventory of 8,000 lbs. It is extremely important that these areas and associated injection processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. O'Neill Vintners & Distillers is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\n\n\n\nOur personnel also monitor the sulfur-dioxide fumigation process and keep an active log of all associated procedures and transactions. In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 cylinders. The contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our process equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCalifornia \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nFederal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nO'Neill Vintners & Distillers ha"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, O'Neill Vintners & Distillers now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for O'Neill Vintners & Distillers employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program O'Neill Vintners & Distillers will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. "
