The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities. Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but is utilized in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.\n\n\n\nMRS operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility. MRS's refrigeration system is designed to provide the following:\n\n\n\n- operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations);\n\n- economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required);\n\n- optimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilized instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant); and,\n\n- consistency of operations, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\n\n\nMRS has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. This was accomplished through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel. The PSM Program has been incorporated as both policy, and most importantly, procedure in every day operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nMRS (Midwest Refrigerated Services Inc.) is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community. The facility is complying with OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPAA?s Risk Management Program rule. The purpose of these regulations are"

Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the MIDWEST REFRIGERATED SERVICES is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.

The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop two stage industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n\n\n3. The \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the MIDWEST REFRIGERATED SERVICES building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\nNote:  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the facility was revised in 2015.  First and foremost, this was performed to update the analysis to reflect the 2010 Census results.  In addition, the release estimates were modified due to the lack of any supporting data that identified which equipment was being used and any assumptions necessary to support that data (i.e., it was not possible to verify that the previous calculations were performed properly).\n\n\n\n4.
