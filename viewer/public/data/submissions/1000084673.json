As part of training, employees participate in drills and exercises in order to test responsiveness to releases of chemicals onsite. These drills and exercises are evaluated by ICMB management to determine if any additional training or education is required.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nThere have not been any reportable releases at the ethanol facility within the past 5 years; however, there was a denaturant release that was not considered reportable per RMP. On April 30, 2015, there was a loss of primary containment of the denaturant tank. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\r\nICMB has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A SPCC and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.  FRP regulations require exercises of internal and external notification systems on a semiannual to annual basis.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nICMB will continue to provide annual training programs to employees covering both safety and environmental pr"

      "SummaryText": "B is located in St. Joseph, Buchanan County, Missouri. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program is the Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture). \r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in one (1) aboveground steel tank with internal floating roof located in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in  a lined berm with gravel overlay for means of secondary containment. A facility provided SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.7-mile radius.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. Whitehead Creek would be affected by a worst-case release of denaturant. \r\n \r\nAlternate Case Scenario:\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank"

Original operations initiated in October 2007.  ICMB will review on-site plans on a regular basis and updates them when necessary.  There have been management changes at the facility, but none that have affected the responsible official. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nICMB has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. ICMB has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices. New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well. ICMB's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the applicable procedures outlined in the SPCC/FRP, Industrial SWPPP, and H&S Plans to respond to, contain, clean-up, and properly dispose of the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nICM"
