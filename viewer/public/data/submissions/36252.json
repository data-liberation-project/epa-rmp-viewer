The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training  associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Fairforest Wastewater Treatment Plant has two (2) regulated substances at the facility above the substance's threshold quantity.  One regulated substance is chlorine with a threshold quantity of 2,500 lb.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process at the facility.  Chlorine is handled in one ton cylinders and the maximum amount handled is 32,000 pounds.  The other regulated substance is sulfur dioxide with a threshold quantity of 5,000 lb.  Sulfur dioxide is used in the wastewater treatment process at the facility.  Sulfur dioxide is also handled in one ton cylinders and the maximum amount handled is 12,000 pounds.  Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \nSpartanburg Sanitary Sewer District has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
