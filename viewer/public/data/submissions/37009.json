This\nteam identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation\nmeasures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such\nmeasures are needed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt\nattention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted. The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from\nthe original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency\nuntil the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and\nretained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final\nresolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations,\nsuch as (1) process  startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5)\nand normal shutdown.

This documentation also provides guidance on how to respond to a deviation from upper or\nlower limits for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating\nprocedures, is readily available to operators in the process area and for other personnel to use as necessary\nto safely perform their tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Thomasville Gas Plant has implemented\na comprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations. New employees receive\nsafety orientation in Thomasville Gas Plant operations.  After successfully completing this basic orientation,\na new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators\ndemonstrate (e.g., through skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks\nin a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive\nrefresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at\nan acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. All of this training is\ndocumented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \nFor specific safety (e.g., H2S safety) and/or regulatory (e.g., hot work permits) issues, PEC develops highly\ninteractive training for all employees on a routine basis.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased\nmaintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished\nby providing contractors with a thorough site orientation that includes (1) a process overview, (2) information\nabout safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices\nprior to their beginning work. In addition, the PEC Thomasville Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety\nprograms and performance during the selection of a contractor. Thomasville Gas Plant personnel periodically\nmonitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a\nchange in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features,\nprocedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment\ninto service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the\ndesign specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses\nchecklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

This commitment is\ndemonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and\naccident prevention, such as employee participation and training and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  PEC policy is to implement practical controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a release does occur, the Thomasville\nGas Plant has a well-defined emergency action plan and trained personnel to control and contain the\nrelease.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe PEC operates the Thomasville Gas Plant to produce natural gas and sulfur from sour gas. The Plant is located in a rual area approximately 10 miles south of Brandon, Ms. The facility consists of an outdoor gas processing facility and control room.  The process section consists of inlet gas separators, patented Sulfinol Treatment process for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur plant, incinerator, and all utilities necessary for the plant operation. (Please see graphic file PECSITE.JPG of Thomasville Gas Plant Site Plan).  The plant has an excellent safety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational excellence.  \n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant has one toxic substance listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP)\nrule, hydrogen sulfide, and one flammable regulated substance, methane, above the threshold quantity of\n10,000 lbs each. The process operations are covered by OSHA's process safety management (PSM)\nstandard and are considered Program Level 3 for t"

The purpose of the HA was to help develop strategies\nfor emergency response and actions for the site.  It must be noted an extensive emergency response plan\nhas been implemented at the site to comply with the requirements of the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board since\nthe inception of the plant and this consists of a network of hydrogen sulfide monitors and on-line computer-\nbased emergency shutdown (ESD) system.  To perform the hazard analysis, PEC assembled a team of\nexperts who are familiar with the design, operation, and maintenance of the gas plant operations.  The HA\nteam used the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\ndated May 24, 1996 and other EPA guidance documents, as necessary.  The HA team used RMPComp and\nArea Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software, developed by EPA and CAMEO team of the\nChemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO), respectively to conduct the\ncalculations.  The calculations were plotted using Mapping Application for Response, Planning, and Local\nOperational Tasks (MARPLOT).  The results of the offsite consequence analysis for toxic and flammable\nsubstances are provided below.\n\nToxic Substance Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the toxic substance is a catastrophic failure of the sulfinol\ncontactor, releasing the entire content of the vessel, containing 3,250 lbs of gaseous H2S over a 10-minute\nperiod.  Although PEC has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences,\nno credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account for evaluating\nthis scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 30 ppm for this WCS is 2.3 miles. (Plea"

Failure of the heat\nexchanger tube (1 outside diameter tube), under 25 psia pressure, would release 260 lbs. in 10 minutes. \nThe release duration of 10 minutes is the approximate time necessary for operators to detect and stop the\nrelease.  No other mitigating measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum\ndistance to the endpoint of 30 ppm (0.042 milligrams per liter) for this ARS is 475 yards (0.30 Mile).\n(Please see graphic file PECTXAR1.JPG) \n\nFlammable Substance Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with the flammable substance is a catastrophic release of the\nentire content of the sulfinol contactor, releasing a mixture of hydrogen sulfide (discussed in previous\nsection) and methane, containing 6200 lbs. of methane by weight  (Entire vapor section of the vessel\nvolume).  A vapor cloud is formed containing the total quantity of methane and 10% of the vapor is assumed\nto detonate with a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the endpoint of 1-psi for this\nWCS is 0.2 miles from the sulfinol contactor.  Although PEC has numerous controls to prevent such a\nrelease and to manage the consequences of such a release, no credit for any safeguards (e.g., passive\nmitigation measures) was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. (Please see graphic file\nPECFLWC1.JPG)\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) associated with the flammable substance involves release of methane\nfrom catastrophic failure of a heat exchanger tube (1 outside diameter tube) routed from the sales gas\ncompressor discharge line, resulting in a release of 2400 lbs. in 10 minutes.

Because the plant process regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\nmanagement program (RMP) regulation is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of\nthe OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accidental\nrelease prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A small plant environment\nand teamwork approach provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM\nstandard elements.  Examples of employee involvement range from participation in the initial process hazard\nanalysis in 1992 to recent changes in operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information\ncreated as a part of the prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident\nprevention program are documented in an employee participation plan in the PSM Manual.  In addition,\nspecific employee participation activities include operations teams and periodic safety meetings to discuss\nspecific safety-related topic.  Meeting attendance sheets are maintained as primary documentation. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Thomasville Gas Plant develops and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to help\nmaintain safe operations of the process.
