This includes reviews by certified refrigeration contractors and registered engineers. This pre-startup review is used to determine areas of equipment or operations that may predispose the system to accidental releases.\nA Business Response Plan has been prepared for the facility and will be implemented to include ammonia refrigeration operations.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Taylor Farms facility is located at 1207 Abbott St. in Salinas, California. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their cold rooms and process water chilling operations. \nThe refrigeration installation for the facility consists of both fixed equipment and portable skid or trailer mounted equipment. The portable units include screw compressors and reciprocating compressors, along with the associated evaporative condensers and electrical controls. Chiller units with integral low sides are also included in the portable refrigeration system. Fixed components include additional evaporative condensers, high-pressure receivers, low-pressure recirculators, ammonia diffusion tanks, and fan coils installed in the cold rooms. The portable systems are in place and operating during the salad-processing season from April through November. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nA pre-startup equipment inspection provides release prevention. This procedure, performed at the beginning of the season, insures that the equipment is ready to operate and that all safety items have been reviewed.

Mitigation measures are not considered for every release scenario. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAmmonia based refrigeration equipment has been on site since the start of the 1997 season. According to Taylor Farms Personnel, since startup there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nTaylor Farms currently has a Business Response Plan in affect that provides emergency contact personnel information, general emergency response procedures, hazardous material release reporting procedures, chemical inventory information, and emergency evacuation procedures.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release. These measures may include installation of upgraded piping and equipment supports, installation of equipment labeling, and implementation of program aimed specifically at the maintenance, training, and emergency response procedures for the ammonia based refrigeration equipment."
