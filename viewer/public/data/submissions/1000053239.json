The Company takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of regulated chemicals. As for emergency response, The Company has established and maintained site-specific procedures for emergency notification and response. These procedures will be reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\n\n\nThe Company understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the PSM/RMP manual.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Tarzan Gas Plant is a 10 mmscf/day natural gas dehydration and liquid hydrocarbon extraction facility that is owned and operated by Targa Midland LLC, a subsidiary of The Company.    \n\n\n\nThe RMP-regulated substances handled at this facility are flammable mixtures and propane. The flammable mixtures are extracted from the natural gas processed at the plant, while propane is used for refrigeration.  The process includes a process skid to extract natural gas liquids, residue compressors to raise the gas pressure from the plant to sales point, a natural gas liquid stabilizer to process any liquids formed in the compression process, and natural gas liquid pumps to push product from th"

There is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Tarzan Plant.  The scenario involves a vapor cloud explosion involving 368,100 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in three interconnected natural gas liquid (NGL) surge tanks. The entire inventory of these vessels are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.5 mile radius. \n\n\n\nThe facility is not located within a populated area; therefore, the WCS would not affect a public receptor and is considered a Program 1 process.  A consideration of the 0.5 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program for Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Tarzan Gas Plant implements the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program for the purpose of accidental release prevention and employee safety.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated flammable materials at the Tarzan Gas Plant meeting the five-year accident history requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Company has established and coordinated emergency response action plans with the Big Spring Fire Department.  The emergency response plan also includes procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address the aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies, if a release occurs.  The specific details of the action plans are documented in the PSM/RMP program manual.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety shall be actively sought from empl"

Employees will be encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted with key employees to meet the PSM requirements. During these sessions, recommendations are made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation is considered for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, each will be considered.  The exercise has provided affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process.\n\n"
