EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n[40 CFR 68.155; CalARP Article 3, 2745.3]\r\nThe Risk Management Program at Uni-Kool Partners is designed to prevent the occurrence and\r\nminimize the consequences of releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration process.\r\nThe following is a summary of the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk\r\nof a hazardous materials release.\r\nThe purpose of the RMP is threefold: 1.) to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals,\r\nespecially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, 2.) to\r\nidentify hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia, and 3.) to provide procedures\r\nto minimize the risks involved with handling this material.\r\nUni-Kool Partners has implemented the RMP at the Salinas, CA facility in order to comply with\r\nregulations, and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protect its employees, equipment,\r\nproperty, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of\r\nanhydrous ammonia.\r\n1. Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\nUni-Kool Partners will maintain a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize any\r\nreleases. The program will include regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging\r\nconditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze\r\nreleases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Incident Investigation Forms. A Risk\r\nManagement Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with this RMP.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.\r\nOperators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration\r\nsystem. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia\r\nrelease. There are emergency shut off switches for shutting down the system. Personnel will\r\nautomatically be notified if any detector e"

When a significant change\r\noccurs, the RMP shall be updated to reflect the change. Any management changes must also be\r\nupdated. This RMP, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia\r\nrefrigeration system, is maintained onsite, and is also submitted electronically to the EPA\r\nCentral Data Exchange (CDX). A copy of the most recent registration is included in Appendix I\r\n7. Five-Year Accident History\r\nAccording to Uni-Kool Partners personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of\r\nanhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries. Releases of ammonia, should\r\nthey occur, will be responded to in accordance with company policy and the procedures outlined\r\nin this RMP.\r\n8. Emergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated emergency response plan\r\n(Business Response Plan). This plan outlines procedures for emergency ammonia release\r\nresponse, as well as general facility response, see Appendix L for the program.\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and\r\ncoordinate response procedures. The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting\r\nemergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be\r\naffected by the release. The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if\r\nnecessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are\r\nrequired.\r\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\r\n\u00b7 Contact phone numbers for emergency coordinator and emergency co"

Repeated or prolonged contact of high\r\nconcentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn.\r\nA Globally Harmonized System for Classification and Labelling Chemicals (GHS) Safety Data\r\nsheet for ammonia is included in Appendix C. Written in both Spanish and English, the GHS\r\ndata sheet details the chemical properties and health hazards of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nUni-Kool Partners maintains an accidental release prevention program designed to eliminate or\r\nminimize ammonia releases. The program includes equipment monitoring, regular inspections\r\nand maintenance, and log keeping of operating conditions, scheduled maintenance, emergency\r\nresponse, and operator training.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety measures in place to prevent accidental\r\nrelease. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the\r\nrefrigeration s"
