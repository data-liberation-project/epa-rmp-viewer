This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  RRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, RRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\r\n\r\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substance\r\nThe plant is located just east of Rosholt, SD and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in a 17,500-gallon aboveground storage tank and anhydrous ammonia (liquidfied under pressure) is stored in portable 2- or 3-ton tanks (maximum of three 3-ton tanks on-site).  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of regulated substances (butane, isopentane, and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.  RRE also uses anhydrous ammonia, which is an RMP-regulated Toxic Substance; however the volume stored does not exceed RMP threshold quantities.  \r\n\r\n5 Year Accident History\r\nRRE purchased the facility formerly know as North Country Ethanol in September 2011.  RRE is not aware of any RMP reportable accidents at the facility within the last 5 years.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program Information\r\nThe plant prevention program includes safety information (Material Safety Data Sheets, regulated substance inventory, and equipment and process specifications), periodic reviews, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually), maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.     \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\nRRE's Safety Compliance Manual, Emergency Action Plan, a"

The Emergency Action Plan addresses numerous emergencies, including releases/spills, and explosions.  The SPCC Plan includes spill prevention and response activities.  Employee training is required.   \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nRRE acquired the facility formerly known as North County Ethanol on September 21, 2011.  RRE is in the process of reviewing facility systems to determine if any additional changes are needed to improve safety."
