      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nBrenntag produces chemicals which are used to clarify and purify the public waters of the Southwest.  As part of being a good neighbor to the community it serves with its chemicals, Brenntag has implemented a number of policies, procedures and systems to help ensure that the chemicals do not adversely effect the outside community.  The following serves as a brief overview of these polices, procedures, and systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrenntag Greens Bayou Facility is located on approximately one hundred and twenty acres on Haden Road about 0.5 miles off of Interstate 10 just inside of Beltway 8 on the east side of Houston, TX. The Brenntag - Greens Bayou Chemical Complex employs 36 hourly plant personnel and 13 administrative employees at the site.  The process areas in the facility are Alum/Aqualum, Bauxite, Bleach/Chlorine Repackaging, and Specialty Chemicals.  The Alum/Aqualum area is the production area for aluminum sulfate(alum)loading and blending of alum with polymers. The Bauxite area is responsible for the manufacture of the base aluminum sulfate material utilized in the Alum/Aqualum area products. The Bleach/Chlorine Repackaging area is the production area for sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and repackaging of chlorine from 90-ton rail cars to 2000-pound containers and 150 pound cylinders. It also handles loading and packaging of caustic and sulfuric acid products. Blending and repackaging of third party chemicals is the activity that takes place at Specialty Chemicals.  Other facilities located on the property include an administrative building, guardhouse, maintenance shop, laboratory, and change house.\r\n\r\nBrenntag is a MARSEC facility and complies with the site Facility Security Plan on file with the Coast Guard (DHS). ALTIVIA adheres to the TWIC card policy as set for by the Department of Homeland Security and ensures proper site security 24 hours per day. All Brenntag employees must be TWIC certified and all visitors/contractors/vendors are subject"

      "SummaryText": "ed to vigorous standards for plant access.\r\n\r\nBrenntag repackages chlorine and utilizes it for Sodium Hypochlorite bleach manufacture at the Greens Bayou facility. The chlorine arrives on site via rail car and is off loaded at one rail spot. Brenntag maintains an inventory of full rail cars (between 3-7 depending on the season) but only utilizes one railcar (180,000 lbs)for manufacturing purposes at any given point. Sulfur Dioxide cylinders (150 lb) are warehoused and distributed from the Greens Bayou facility. Brenntag maintains an inventory of no more than 100 cylinders at any given time. Brenntag does not manufacture Sulfur Dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe handling of chlorine in the Greens Bayou Facility gives the potential of effecting the outside community. This is the chemical which is the driving force behind the policies, procedures, and systems which govern the operation of the entire Brenntag facility.  Under OSHA 29CFR1910.119 (Process Safety Management) Brenntag developed a fourteen section manual that helps prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic release of chlorine.  Training is one of the most important sections of PSM.  Brenntag operators receive 40-hour Hazwoper training in addition to several hands on training topics throughout the calendar year.  This level of training allows us to respond to facility incidents which may occur.  This level of training coupled with an active involvement by all employees to identify needed change is invaluable to maintaining a safe and reliable facility. Other aspects of the PSM such as Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Compliance Audits, Pre-Start up Reviews, Process Hazard Analysis are all rigorously followed, reviewed, and updated to ensure optimum safety and compliance with PSM/RPM regulations.\r\n\r\nBrenntag Emergency Reponse Plan (ERP) was reviewed and updated in 2009.  The ERP is divided into thirteen sections ranging from administration, policies, duties, chemical information, not"

Brenntag conducts plant wide drills quaterly and also participates in drills, whenever staged, conducted for all the facilities located on Haden Road.  Other particpants in the Haden Road drill include Office of Emergency Management, Sheriff's Department, and CloverLeaf Fire Department.\r\n\r\nCommunications is an important tool in an effective response or mitigation process.  At Brenntag, any level of chlorine above 0.5 ppm will shut the entire process down.  At this level a plant wide alarm sounds informing all operations of a chlorine release.  If a problem exists, operations personnel secure their process areas and proceed to the response team assembly area.  Should the alarm occur during off-hours, the security guards have pagers and call out telephone numbers for supervisors and have been informed as to personal protection techniques.  Once assembled, the response team will secure the situation or will call upon outside assitance if necessary.  During these periods, the offsite impacts will be analyzed and the Communications Officer will make all necessary contacts.\r\n\r\nBrenntag has continued to be vigilant in the area of accident prevention and accidental releases. The Greens Bayou has had one accidental release of chlorine in the last five years (August 2007) and the release amount was 63 lbs of chlorine. The release was quickly mitigated and did not have any offsite impact. Brenntag utilized this incident to further improve the process and minimize any future impact or liability due an accidental release of chlorine. \r\n\r\nAs Brenntag continues to grow, we are continually looking for new and improved methods to ensure the safety of our personnel and our community.  These changes can only occur with continued input and support of our personnel, regulatory agencies, and our community. Brenntag will continue to focus on training, advances in techn"
