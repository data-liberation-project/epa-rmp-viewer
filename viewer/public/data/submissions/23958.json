We are an agricultural based business that primarily buys and sells grain as well as other inputs necessary for crop production.\n\nOur NH3 plant consist of one 11,000 GALLON storage tank,  with associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The total capacity of the plant is 48,000 pounds when filled to 85% capacity. \n\n The worst case scenario for our Anhydrous Ammonia would be the failure of one 11,000-gallon tank,  resulting in a gas release over a 10 minute period. The total pounds released would be approximately     48, 000.  According to our DEGADIS model, the distance to endpoint is 1.63 miles with an approximate population of approximately 375 area residents.  Public receptors include schools, residences and a recreation area.  The alternative release scenario would be a transfer hose rupture with a total of 11,908 pounds released to the air.  The distance to endpoint would be .83 miles affecting the same 375 area citizens. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes, are regulations.   The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed,and maintained in accordance with Texas State Ag Department and the Railroad Commission, which inspects our plant intermitently and we always respond and correct all their request for improvement.\n\n We are pleased to report we have had no accidents in the past five years at this facility, and hope to maintain this good safety record by constantly upgrading and reviewing our safety procedures and practices.  Our employees are trained annually in the safe use of the product, the hazards of NH3, proper plant maintenance practices as well as the recommended operatimg procedures.  The employees always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) du"
