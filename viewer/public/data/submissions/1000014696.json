Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n    In this Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminals, LLC (Kinder Morgan) distribution facility, we handle Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes VAM valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling VAM to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health, as well as our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle VAM combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n    Our emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n    *    The primary purpose of this facility is to temporarily store, break bulk, and distribute VAM to both retail and wholesale customers.  VAM is used as a raw material for manufacturing polyvinyl resins, such as those used in latex paints, paper coating, adhesives, textile finishing and safety glass inter-layers.VAM is received by ship and stored in storage tanks throughout the Terminal.  This facility has equipment for unloading ships, barges, rail cars and tank trucks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n    *    The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is VAM.\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n    This facility complies with EPA's A"
