However, they do operate under the requirements of Program\nLevel 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of\nemployees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since\noperations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid\npotential accidental chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane\nrelease has occurred at the Hampton Rail Siding within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local\nemergency response groups such as the Hampton Fire Department. The facility operator is\nresponsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The\nEmergency Action Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public,\nand the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u2022\tThe Safety Information provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u2022\tThe Hazard Review provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards."
