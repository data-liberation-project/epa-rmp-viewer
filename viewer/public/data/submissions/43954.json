The facility is composed of office space, parking lots, aboveground storage tanks, warehouse space, and truck maintenance and washing area. Operation of this facility began in 1980.\r\nTAPI is a producer of polyurethane foam produced by the reaction of an isocyanate group with an alcohol or hydroxyl contributor (polyol) in the presence of water, catalyst and a blowing agent. The reaction is started in a reaction mixer and continued in an open tunnel to allow the expansion and blowing off the heat and gases formed. Blowers installed along the tunnel vent the heat and gases to the atmosphere.\r\nEmployees collect the blocks and store them for curing in a designated area of the warehouse. Usually, the foam is ready for further cutting and processing in 24 hours. Production of foam is normally conducted during the morning hours from Monday to Thursday.\r\nTAPI uses a listed chemical that exceeds the threshold quantity established in the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68.130). This chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer). \r\nThere are no regulated flammable substances handled in the facility, which exceed the threshold quantity.\r\nTAPI has performed and has documented an Offsite Consequence Analysis for the accidental release of TDI, following the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis document and utilizing the RMP.Comp software for endpoint distance estimation. The report on this analysis is part of this Risk Management Program documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nc) Accidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific p"

The program complies with all applicable federal, state and local regulations for the prevention of accidents or releases of hazardous substances. Some of the actions taken at the facility to prevent accidental release include the following:\r\n* Periodic inspection of storage tanks, lines, pumps, valves, etc.\r\n* Manual inspection of level indicators prior to loading of the tanks to prevent overfilling\r\n* Storage tanks are located inside concrete dikes and sheltered to prevent corrosion.\r\n* Automatic shutoff control systems are installed to safely stop the process in case of electrical power loss or any other abnormal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nd) Five-year accident history\r\nTech Aerofoam Products International, Inc. has had no incidents in its facility involving Toluene Diisocyanate for the past five years that meet the requirements, as defined by EPA in 40 CFR 68.42, for inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\ne) Emergency Response Program\r\nTech Aerofoam Products International, Inc. has prepared a written Emergency Response Plan that is part of the Emergency Response Program implemented at the facility.  The Plan includes all the federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This Emergency Response Plan defines the steps to be taken in case of an emergency to in order to reduce hazards and damage to employees, property, neighborhood or environment. The plan names the Emergency Response Coordinators' addresses and home phone numbers and lists the emergency equipment available at the facility for response.
