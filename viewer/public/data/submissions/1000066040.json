We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This section provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n?    An overview of our emergency response program;\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment;\n\n?    The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule; and\n\n?    The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Paris facility consists of a single building situated on 70 acres.  The building consists of 40,000 square feet of manufacturing, 50,000 square feet of laboratory activities and administration, and 200,000 square feet of warehousing. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: \n\n\n\nTOXICS\n\n?    Chloroform: Chloroform is brought to the facility in ta"

Chloroform is then distributed for use in a laboratory setting [subject to Program Level 3].\n\n?    Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is brought to the facility in tankers in bulk form via 4,400-gallon tanker trucks. The chemical is subdivided into drums and bottles. Formaldehyde is then distributed for use in a laboratory setting [subject to Program Level 3].\n\n?    Hydrofluoric Acid greater than 50%: Hydrofluoric Acid (up to 52%) is brought to the facility in 250-gallon totes.  Each tote contains 2,460-pounds of hydrofluoric acid.  The hydrofluoric acid is subdivided into bottles and then distributed for use in the microelectronic industry [subject to Program Level 3].\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLES\n\n?    Ethyl Ether: Ethyl Ether is brought to the facility in tankers in bulk form via 6,700-gallon tanker trucks.  The chemical is distilled and/or subdivided into cycletainers, drums, and bottles.  Ethyl ether is then distributed for use in a laboratory setting [Subject to Program Level 1].\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that could potentially be posed to our employees, the public, and the environment if one of these were mishandled or otherwise involved in an accident. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.

Operating procedures are in place and operators trained to make sure all operations are understood and established procedures followed.\n\n?    All changes which do not involve replacement-in-kind are managed through a management of change system to insure proper review prior to implementation.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted for all systems.\n\n?    Surveillance systems are in place to assist with timely identification and remediation for all leaks at the bulk unloading points.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
