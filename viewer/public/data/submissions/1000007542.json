      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe City of Dallas Water Utilities maintains a policy of safe water and wastewater treatment plant operation, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment. They cooperate with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies to promote effective contingency planning in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs.\n\nAs part of this policy, Dallas Water Utilities maintains compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs (USEPA) regulations for the prevention and mitigation of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances under section 112\u00c2\u00ae of the Clean Air Act.   Facilities covered by the regulations (40 CFR 68) are required to implement a risk management program and submit a description of the program (called a risk management plan, or RMP) to USEPA.  \n\nThe Bachman Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage and use of chlorine and ammonia.

Consequently, the RMP for the Bachman WTP was updated and resubmitted to USEPA in 2007.  \n\nThe Bachman WTP is voluntarily resubmitting their RMP in 2009 to synchronize their RMP to the five year cycle based on the initial June 1999 submission.  The following information summarizes the 2009 update and resubmission:\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Bachman Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine combined with ammonia to disinfect water.  The plant receives raw water from Lake Grapevine and Lake Lewisville, by way of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.  Water is treated at the plant and subsequently pumped into the distribution network of pipelines, pump stations, and storage tanks.\n\n1. Chlorine\nDuring 2006-2007, the Bachman WTP completely replaced an older chlorine feed system by installing a new system.  The Bachman WTP has a maximum storage quantity of 205 tons of chlorine at its facility.  The chlorine is stored in two Department of Transportation certified 90-ton rail cars and a 25-ton emergency storage tank, which is only filled with 20 tons due to administrative controls.  The total amount of chlorine exceeds the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the USEPA\n \nThe majority of chlorine is delivered to the Bachman WTP in the rail cars by railroad on rail spurs.  A chlorine tanker truck supplies chlorine for the emergency tank, when necessary.  The rail cars and the tank are located inside the Chlorine Building.   \nThe chlorine feed facilities at the Bachman WTP consist of storage tanks (the two 90-ton rail cars and one 25-ton emergency tank); liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves; leak detectors and alarms; evaporators; gas piping and miscellaneous valves; chlorinators; injectors, solution piping, valves, and diffusers; plant water piping and valves; and a scrubber system.  A release of chlorine gas could potentially occur at the chlorine storage area or at the chlorine process areas.\n\n2. Ammonia\nDuring 2006-2007, the Bachman WTP added a separa"

The Bachman WTP maximum storage quantity is now 51.5 tons of ammonia (anhydrous) at its facility.  The ammonia is stored in two 10,000 gallon stationary tanks. The total amount of ammonia exceeds the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds set by the USEPA \n\nAmmonia is delivered to the Bachman WTP by a tanker truck.  The two stationary tanks are located inside the Ammonia Building.\n\nThe ammonia feed facilities at the Bachman WTP consist of storage tanks (the two 10,000 gallon storage tanks); liquid feed piping and miscellaneous valves; leak detectors and alarms; evaporators; gas piping and miscellaneous valves; ammoniators; diffusers; and ammonia scrubbers.  A release of ammonia gas could potentially occur at the ammonia storage area or at the ammonia process areas.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nIn May 2009, Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. updated the offsite consequence analyses at Bachman WTP by identifying and documenting a worse case scenario (chlorine) and an alternate release scenario for chlorine and two alternate release scenarios for ammonia.   EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP*Comp was used as the model for the resubmission.  \n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Bachman WTP was reviewed for the period from June 2004 through June 2009.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Dallas Water Utilities maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of chlorine and ammonia at Bachman WTP.  The program consists of seven elements:\n\n1. Safe"

The information is made available to employees and contractors at Bachman WTP who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\n\n2. Hazard Review\nA hazard review of chlorine and ammonia processes and procedures is conducted at least every five (5) years to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases, or whenever there are changes that require a new hazard review.  In June 2009 a revised chlorine and ammonia process hazard analysis using the \"What-If\" method was conducted by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. with the assistance of Bachman WTP plant management and staff familiar with the process, operation, and maintenance.  Existing precautions were reviewed and determined to be adequate.  Potential changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that could further improve the overall safety of the chlorine and ammonia systems were identified.\n\nThe results of this review are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.  Any changes resulting from this review are reported in this resubmission.\n\n3. Operating procedures\nDallas Water Utilities have developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the chlorine and ammonia processes at Bachman WTP consistent with the safety information. Bachman WTP operating procedures include startup, shutdown, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\n4. Training\nAll Bachman WTP s"

Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure Bachman WTP staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \n\n5. Maintenance\nBachman WTP has developed and implemented a preventive and corrective maintenance program to ensure equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is functioning properly and installed to minimize the risk of releases.   The program addresses equipment testing, inspection, and preventive maintenance schedules, and documentation of equipment testing, inspection, and preventive and corrective maintenance activities. \n\n6. Compliance audits\nUSEPA's risk management rule requires that Bachman WTP complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years. The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among Bachman WTP staff.  The risk management rule also requires that copies of the last 2 audits are maintained as part of the written program.\n\nMalcolm Pirnie, Inc., with the assistance of Bachman WTP plant management and staff familiar with the processes operation and maintenance, conducted an audit in April 2009. The results of this both audits, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records. Copies of audits performed in 2004 and 2007 are also available. \n\n7. Incident Investigation\nBachman WTP management investigates each incident that resulted in or co"

A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. \n\nAn incident investigation team will be established following criteria established in the Bachman WTP risk management program.  As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nNo incidents were reported between 2004 and 2009.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAn Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed for Bachman WTP, which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to ensure that emergency response coverage is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  These procedures include leak investigation, operational-level response activities, and communications to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Dallas Fire Department HAZMAT Team, in the event of an emergency. \n\nDallas Water Utilities updated and incorporated the ERP, as well as sections of the risk management program, into an all-hazard integrated contingency plan (ICP) in 2007.  The ICP format minimizes duplication in the preparation and use of emergency response and risk management plans for various regulatory requirements, and eliminates confusion for Bachman WTP staff that would have had to decide which plan applies to a particular emergency.\n\nBachman WTP staff are also participating in DWU-wide ongoing emergency response preparation and training consisting of training and drills at the awareness, performance (operational and technician) and National Incident Manage"
