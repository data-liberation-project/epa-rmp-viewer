The terminal functions as a storage and distribution facility for the fertilizer used by Farmlands 600,000 producer-members to grow the crops which provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 40,000 tons of ammonia and 52,000 tons of UAN is distributed through the Farmland facility that has been supplying co-ops in the northern third of Illinois and Wisconsin for a decade.  As a terminal, the facility provides a vital link in the chain of Farmland inputs.  Anhydrous ammonia, produced at Farmlands nitrogen manufacturing facilities, is shipped to the Henry terminal where it is stored until needed by local co-ops for their patrons fields.  By eliminating much of the shipping costs for the co-ops, the terminal helps contain the cost of fertilizer for Farmland member-owners as well as provide a convenient location for them to get their product.\n\nImpact on the community\n\nFarmland is a solid, reliable member of the Henry community.  Its employees are committed to customer service and the facility is available to service member-owners as needed throughout the year.  Farmland's Henry employees know their customers are also their neighbors and strive to \"always be there if someone needs us.\"\n\nEmployee snapshot\n\nFarmland has four full-time and one part-time employee at the Henry terminal with 25 years of combined operating experience.  Although few in number, these employees make a large impact on the community in which they live.  They are involved in the Chamber of Commerce as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The terminal staff are involved in community activities and support these functions through action such as newspaper ads for local graduation and sports activities.\n\nFarmland employ"

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.

It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer, or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nFarmland has considered potential worst-case releases from the refrigerated atmospheric storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike and the bullet tank, the two largest vessels onsite, containing anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFarmlands hypothetical worst-case scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the terminals 20,000 ton refrigerated, atmospheric storage tank.  The worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank, with subsuquent evaporation from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) which has been demonstrated to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release event.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nThis scenario, we believe, is a hypothetical worst-case event di"

In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and largely preclude such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternate Case Toxic Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical worst-case, tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved, due to numerous shutdown safeguards present, as they are through out the terminal, and operator intervention which tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is, a release of ammonia due to the failure of a 6\" barge unloading pipe.  The pipe is assumed to fail and release ammonia for 1 minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the DEGADIS model which shows that, under typical ambient conditions, the impact of the release would extend off-site.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis revalidation is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
