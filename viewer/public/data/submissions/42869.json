This request was made in March 1997 pursuant to California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  As required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68, RMPs for the wastewater pump and chlorination stations using chlorine in ton containers have been filed with USEPA.  \nThis Risk Management Plan identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS?s) handled in excess of California threshold quantities at CSD?s own facilities.  It also includes information on procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training for Sacramento County Water Agency?s Department of General Services? RS facilities, for which CSD provides operation, maintenance, and emergency response services.  It describes the structured assessments of hazards which were conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS?s; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mi"

Specific information on sites for which the Sacramento County Water Agency and the Department of General Services are primarily responsible is contained in RMP documents submitted by those agencies concurrently with this revision.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCSD requires that the receipt, storage and handling of RS?s at facilities it operates and maintains be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, CSD has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nCSD operates several wastewater pump stations and chlorination stations in Sacramento County.  The RS used at the Northeast Chlorination Station (N18), Arden Sewage Pump Station (N19), Parkway Chlorine Station (S10), Natomas Sewage Pumping Station (S30), and considered in this RMP is chlorine.  \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Programs\nGeneral accident release prevention programs instituted by CSD are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.  CSD maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program"

These include, among other items, replacing chlorine with sodium hypochlorite solution; changing the chlorine feeding system from a pressure system to a system using vacuum regulator valves mounted on the ton container gas valves at the Northeast Chlorination Station (N18), Arden Sewage Pump Station (N19), Natomas Sewage Pumping Station (S30), Parkway Chlorine Station (S10) and eliminating the chlorine receiving and storage facilities at the CSD corporation yard at the County Branch Center.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine releases at any CSD facility within the past five years meeting the criteria stated in the CalARP regulations.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nCSD responds to releases of chlorine at all sites it operates and maintains.  CSD?s Emergency response program applicable to chlorine consists of a first response plan for chlorine release emergencies by the CSD Chlorine Team in accordance with a written Chlorine Leak Response procedure. Personnel assigned to the Chlorine Team all have chlorine awareness training and personal protective equipment training and fit testing.  The chlorine emergency response program incorporates communication and coordination with Sacramento County HMD and the Sacramento County HazMat Response Teams.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCSD-1 is performing a study to replace the chlorine currently used at N018 with an alternate substance. In addition by 6/15/05 CSD-1 plans to reset leak alarms to 1ppm and record in written inspection/maintenance proceedures. By 6/24/05 a new written procedure will be in place for changing light bulbs over the chlorine containers. Also by 10/30/05 installation of ball checks will be completed on the header betwee"
