The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\n5.3.1. Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nUnited Cooperative maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspects the 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessel, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a routine basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n5.5    Training\n\n\n\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.

Employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g.,shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.
