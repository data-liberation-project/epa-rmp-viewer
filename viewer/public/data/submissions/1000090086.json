Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\n\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process.  United Cooperative inspects the 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessel, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a routine basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n5.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, United maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after an emergency shutdown.  The information is reviewed as needed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\n5.5    Training\n\n\n\nUnited has an anhydrous ammonia operator safety training program in place to train employees involved in the anhydrous ammonia process.
