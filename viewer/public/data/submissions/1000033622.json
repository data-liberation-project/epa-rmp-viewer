Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe management and employees of Crop Production Services at the Taft, TX facility are committed to the\r\nprevention of any release of chemicals handled at the facility. If a release should occur, this facility is\r\nprepared to work with the local or state hazardous material team, the local fire department, the local or state\r\nadministering agency, the tribal natural resource manager and our emergency response contractor to\r\ncontrol, contain and clean up the release.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information (Stationary Source and regulated substance(s))\r\nThe primary activity at this facility is: a retail agriculture and chemical dealer that sales to the end user.\r\nThis facility stores and handles one regulated substance(s) Anhydrous Ammonia. It is also used at the facility\r\nfor the production of Ammonium Polyphosphate (a non-regulated substance).\r\nAmmonium Polyphosphate is produced under contract by a third party company utilizing a portable reactor,\r\nand stored at the facility. It is used as a fertilizer for direct field application by growers.\r\n\r\n3. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative release scenario, however it has been withheld from\r\nthis Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by the US EPA.\r\n\r\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThis facility complies with the following standards, codes and regulations:\r\nNational Electrical Code\r\nUniform Fire Code\r\nANSI K 61.1, 1999 Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, (American National\r\nStandard Institute).\r\n29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n29 CFR 1920.38 Emergency Action Plans\r\n29 CFR 1910.39 Fire Prevention Plans\r\n29 CFR 1910.120(p)(8) and (q) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\r\n\r\n5.
