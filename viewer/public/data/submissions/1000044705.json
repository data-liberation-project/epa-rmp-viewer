This update is prepared to comply with the requirements of EPA 40 CFR 68 for Risk Management Programs. \n\n\n\nIn addition, this re-submittal incorporates the inclusion of the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage and Loading Area as separate processes, as recommended based on the EPA PSM/RMP audit of April 2009.  Although previously included as part of an existing process, covered under all required elements of PSM and RMP, the change identifies each one as a separate covered process.\n\n\n\nNormal butane, stored within the railcars are temporarily stored in the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage area.  Normal butane is used to meet winter gasoline blending requirements.  Thus, the number of rail cars on site varies seasonally (i.e. more rail cars primarily in the winter months only).  Therefore, this RMP filing will be predictive for the LPG Rail Car Temporary Storage and Loading Area.\n\n\n\nThe refinery is required to meet the requirements Program Level 3 for this regulation because the covered processes in the refinery\n\n\n\na) Do not meet the eligibility requirements for Program Level 1 as defined,\n\nb) Have a NAICS which is listed for Program Level 3, and \n\nc) Are subject to the OSHA PSM standard in 29CFR1910.119.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe  Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, has a long-standing commitment to worker, public, and environmental safety.

Special groups, committees and individuals have been identified as having PSM responsibilities at the refinery. Nevertheless, all employees are encouraged to raise specific suggestions or concerns related to process safety management by contacting their immediate supervisor or the PSM coordinator.  The LAR Employee Participation Program is described in Standing Instruction PSM-1.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nAt the LAR, we have compiled process safety information for all processes containing hazardous or regulated materials as required by state and federal regulations, such as PSM, RMP, and CalARP.  This information has to do with process chemicals, technology, and equipment used in the handling, storage, and processing of regulated hazardous substances. Additionally, this compiled process safety information is used in the LAR PSM program as a resource for the teams performing process hazard analyses.  The information can also be helpful for the trainers who develop the training programs and the operating procedures, for the contractors whose employees will be working with the refinery processes, and for emergency responders in preparing for response should a release occur.  Standing Instruction PSM-2 that describes the Management of Change procedure also contains a roadmap to assist the user in finding the process safety information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA primary element of the LAR"

Through this process, information is obtained that will help improve process safety and system reliability, as well as reducing the potential consequences of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Because of the  and complexity of many of the refinery processes, the HAZOP methodology has been selected as the most appropriate PHA method in conducting the PHA for each process.  A HAZOP team at LAR typically consists of a process engineer, an experienced operator, an instrument & electrical engineer/technician, a mechanical engineer, and other part-time team members.  The team leader (a.k.a. the HAZOP facilitator) is fully knowledgeable in the proper implementation of the HAZOP methodology.  Part-time team members typically provide specialized expertise in areas such as safety and health, and equipment inspection/metallurgy/corrosion.  Standing Instruction PSM-3 summarizes the LAR procedure for conducting PHAs.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe LAR provides written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: process startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  The operating procedures describe tasks to be performed, data to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The LAR takes steps to update the procedures to reflect current operations and the procedures are certified annually by the operating staff.  In addition, operating procedures are updated when there are any changes in the process as a result of the management of change procedures.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAnother primary element of the LAR Prevention Program is Training.

The LAR provides initial training to new hires and regular refresher training to the refinery employees.  The job skill training is presented in various forms and degrees and is dependent on the skills required for the employee's job or position.  The purpose of this training is to elevate the aptitude and knowledge of the operation personnel of the process control and technology used and the equipment operated in the refinery.  All employees, including maintenance and contractor employees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances are provided with safety training.  The goal of the safety training is to provide information to the workers so they will understand the recognized hazards of the processes and chemicals that they work with and around.   \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has established the Contractor Safety Program (Standing Instruction SAF-30) as a screening process that helps identify and select contractors who will perform work in and around processes that involve hazardous chemicals.  Such contractors must have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and certifications for the job tasks which they are being employed.  For contractors whose safety performance on the job is not known, the LAR obtains information on injury and illness rates and references regarding the contractor.  An evaluation is also conducted of contractor work methods and experiences.  Thus, contractors without safety programs or with unacceptable safety records will not be invited to perform works at the LAR.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe LAR has implemented a Management of Change (MOC) procedure (Standing Instruction PSM-2) to manage changes to the refinery units.

The Management of Change procedure also covers changes in process technology, changes to equipment and instrumentation, and changes to safety sensitive organizational changes.  Changes in process technology can result from changes in production rates, raw materials, experimentation, equipment unavailability, new equipment, new product development, change in catalyst and changes in operating conditions to improve yield or quality.  Equipment changes include, among others, change in materials of construction, equipment specifications, capacity, piping pre-arrangements, experimental equipment, computer program revisions, and changes in alarms and interlocks.  \n\nTemporary changes are also subject to the management of change provisions in PSM-2 and the procedure also insures that the equipment and operating procedures are returned to their original or designed conditions at the end of the temporary change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nA pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is carried out in conjunction with an MOC or a new project or construction (Standing Instructions PSM-5).  The PSSR is conducted before implementing a modification to a process, or commissioning a new project.  \n\nAs it is LAR practice to conduct a PHA for various types of changes and for all new projects, there could be some recommendations resulting from the PHA that are required to be addressed before implementation.  A PSSR is carried out in the form of a checklist to comply with requirements of the applicable regulations.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place for the continued integrity of process equipment at LAR.

Elements of the mechanical integrity program are as follows: (1) categorization of equipment and instrumentation, (2) inspection and testing program, (3) maintenance program, (4) documentation, and (5) quality assurance program.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nAll non-routine work, and some routine work that are conducted in process areas at the refinery are controlled using specific company instructions, described in Standing Instruction SAF-003 (Work Permits). This specific company instruction includes Safe Work, Hot Work and Confined Space Entry.  The Hot Work Permit is discussed below.  \n\n\n\nA hot work permit describes the steps that operating, maintenance and contractor personnel must follow to obtain the necessary clearance to perform different types of work involving hot surfaces, flame, or energized equipment.  The hazards identified for the work being performed are communicated to those personnel performing the work, and also to those personnel who may be affected by the work being performed, especially when the work being performed could affect the safety of the process.

The program helps to verify that LAR's programs and practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Every three years, the refinery undergoes an PSM/RMP Compliance Audits conducted by company staff.  The audit approach includes the following steps: (1) pre-audit preparation, (2) on-site field review, and (3) post-audit follow-up.
