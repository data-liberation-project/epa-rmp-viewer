Vernon LP Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used for the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Mt. Vernon, IN. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low sulfur diesel/#2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various petroleum-based additives.\n\nThe Mt. Vernon LP Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. MPLX believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand-in-hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. MPLX promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that MPLX has designed and implemented at the Mt. Vernon LP Terminal including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances.\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs.\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals.\nD. An overview of the emergency response program.\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Butane Fuel Blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances were identified. By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is n"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Butane Fuel Blending Process.\n\nThe Butane Fuel Blending process is a batch-type process based on seasonal RVP adjustments. Butane is received by truck (transports) and piped directly to and injected into the gasoline barge-loading lines. Process safety controls for the offloading skid that are used include emergency shutoff valves with a fusible element (rated at < 250 deg. F) and local/remote manual actuation; plus, a check valve for instantaneous closure in the event of a pull-away event.  A \"Smart Hose\" with engineered breakaway capabilities plus self-closing valves at each connection point is also utilized.  Other protective measures/system controls include pipe thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, grounding, vessel pressure reliefs, vessel excess flow valves, and high-level shutdowns.  A deluge system with manifold is available to the fire department to facilitate vessel cooling water application.  Access to the Facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and approved contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Mt. Vernon LP Terminal accidental release prevention and emergency planning/response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substance to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The f"

The Mt. Vernon LP Terminal and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, MPLX also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering/administrative controls to help prevent, identify, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Redundant control systems;\n-Manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of safety devices/critical equipment;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation:\n\n-Process and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity (also actuated via a fusible element);\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks; and\n-\"Smart-Hose\" with design br"

Vernon LP Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Code (NFPA-58) requirements for LP Gas. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP)/\"Smart Plan\" is in place for the Facility with response activities being coordinated with the Black Township Fire Department (primary responder) and the Posey County LEPC.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Mt. Vernon LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal keeps records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated follow-up actions, where appropriate.  As this is a new process, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the release of materials resulting in consequences covered under the EPA RMP reporting requirements.  The Terminal tracks all process safety events/incidents per API 754.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Mt. Vernon LP Terminal is identified as a \"non-responding stationary source\".  As previously noted, the Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Black Township Fire Department (primary responder) and Posey County Emergency Management Agency (LEPC.) An ERAP/\"Smart Plan\" is in place to inform employees what to do in case of a release or fire including implementation of emergency response notification procedures.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Mt.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMPLX is continually striving to make the Mt. Vernon LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, MPLX actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements. All Process Safety Events (as identified in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and/or investigated via a root cause analysis (TapRooT) per corporate policy.  Additionally, the Mt. Vernon Terminal is evaluating additional/improved emergency power capabilities for the process."
