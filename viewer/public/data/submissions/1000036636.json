When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, MI considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new or modifications of existing processes. \r\n\r\nMI strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  MI implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, MI requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of employees with regard to these operating procedures.  The Facility has an established Management of Change (MOC) procedure for all new or revised products.  MI's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances. \r\n\r\nMI's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release. In the event of an accidental release, the Ferndale Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.

Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process.  The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate. \r\n\r\n3.1.5.\tMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Ferndale Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration, and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meets the design standards required for service in the plant's processes.  The mechanical integrity program includes: \r\n\r\n-\tSpecifications for inspection and testing of process equipment \r\n-\tSpecifications for replacement parts and equipment \r\n-\tProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment \r\n-\tTraining of maintenance personnel \r\n-\tDocumentation of maintenance activities\r\n\r\n3.1.6.\tManagement of Change\r\nThe Ferndale Plant management of change (MOC) program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change program to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affe"

This review confirms that:\r\n\r\n-\tConstruction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\n-\tAdequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place\r\n-\tEmployee training has been completed \r\n-\tFor a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified\r\n\r\nA pre startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed. \r\n\r\n3.1.8.\tCompliance Audit\r\nThe Ferndale Plant audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of operations at the plant.  The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented. \r\n\r\nMI also performs corporate audits of the facility's programs, process and documentation at regular intervals.  The facility is required to address all action items within 6 months of notification. \r\n\r\n3.1.9.\tIncident Investigation\r\nThe Ferndale Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the inves"

The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant.  Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs, MOCs, and operating procedures. \r\n\r\n3.1.11.\tHot Work Permits\r\nThe Ferndale Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's safe work practices orientation. \r\n\r\n3.1.12.\tContractors\r\nThe Ferndale Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their e"
