              "Description": "Airgas Specialty Gases is an industrial gas distribution facility.  This facility best fits with NAICS Code 42269.  Our safety information was last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), State Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American National Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility on April 28, 1999.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on theie processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the ethylene system.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance chacks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program. \n\nThere has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane, and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.   Airgas has not repackaged either of these two products since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future, yet below levels for RMP and PSM.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and mehtyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.\n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the ethylene repackaging system are knowledgeabel in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of compressed gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of ethylene into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the ethylene system.  These maintenance procedures involve visual inspections prior to filling cylinders with the ethylene.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (WesMor Cryogenic Services Inc.) who is knowledgeable with the ethylene system.  The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office.\n\nAirgas Specialty Gases contracted Environemtnal Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information. operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety Management for their prevention program.",

We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), State Fire Codes, Texas Railroad Commission Regulations, American National Standards Institute, and applicable OSHA Regulations.  These standards have been implemented through written manuals and/or procedures.  The most recent hazard review was conducted for this facility on April 28, 1999.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment and an excess flow valve.  Operating and training procedures were also last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  The employees at Airgas Specialty Gases are trained on-the-job with demonstration and observation competency testing.  Maintenance procedures were last reviewed on April 28, 1999.  Airgas Specialty Gases utilizes outside contractors to conduct any required manual maintenance on their processes.  The contractors knowledge of these systems, as well as the safeguards they utilize during maintenance help in the overall prevention of releases for the ethylene system.  This is a repackaging system, so the standard operating procedures and maintenance checks on the system are the main focus of the prevention program. \n\nThere has been a release of hazardous materials from this location in the past 5 years.  This release involved two products (ethane, and methane).  This release was due to an equipment failure.  Airgas has not repackaged either of these two products since.  They expect to repackage these two products in the future, yet below levels for RMP and PSM.  This release helped trigger an investigation into the safety aspects associated with the ethylene and mehtyl chloride systems.  The release (fire) occured on February 25, 1999, and there were no offsite impacts.\n\nEmployees who are trained in the proper operating procedures of the methyl chloride repackaging system are knowledgeabel in the Standard Operating procedures of the system, as well as the SOPs for the filling of low pressure gas cylinders.  These procedures are followed to help in the prevention of releases of methyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Maintenance procedures are also conducted (though limited) for the mehtyl chloride system.  These maintenance procedures involve visual inspections prior to filling cylinders with the methyl chloride.  If any part of the system is in need of repair, the maintenance is conducted by an outside contractor (Jack B Kelly) who is knowledgeable with the methyl chloride, as well as other compressed gas tractor trailer systems.  The trailer that is leased by Airgas is serviced and maintained by Enterprise.   The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the methyl chloride system.    The contractor can utilize the O&M manual for information regarding valve types, piping, tubing, etc. to help maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.  This manual is located in the Plant Manager's office, although since they own the same model trailer, they can utilize their own manual.\n\nAirgas Specialty Gases contracted Environemtnal Data Services, which triggered a review of the safety information. operating and maintenance procedures and training.  Airgas is a Level 3 Prevention Program, and is implementing Process Safety Management for their prevention program.",

      "SummaryText": "In this industrial gas distribution facility, (Airgas Specialty Gases), we handle several different types of gases.  Most of these gases are repackaged from storage vessels into tube trailers, and/or smaller cylinders.  There are two products at this location which fall under the risk management plan requirements.  These products are methyl chloride and ethylene.  The toxic and flammable characteristics of these products makes it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling the two products.  These products are two different process, yet the safe prevention practices are similar in nature.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and repackage ethylene and methyl chloride, combined in coordination with the operations and maintenance procedures provided to all personnel responsible for the use of the systems.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store, repackage, and distribute industrial gases to the customer.  Methyl chloride is received by tractor trailer truck.  The stroage vessel is located on the trailer itself, and the methyl chloride is repackaged directly off the trailer into low pressure cylinders.  Ethylene is recieved by truck as well, yet it is stored in a vessel on site.  The ethylene is repackaged from the storage vessel into tube trailers, and small cylinders.  The maximum amount of methyl chloride which can be stored in a trailer on site is 36,000 pounds.  The maximum amount of ethylene that can be stored on-site is 80,000 pounds.\n\nEmployees conduct proper start-up procedures for both processes.  The methyl chloride system must start with the proper setting and secur"

Once this accomplished, they can hook-up all items necessary to off-load the methyl chloride, and repackage it directly into low pressure cylinders.  Visual cylinder checks including but not limited to tare weight, ownership stamp, valve threadings, etc. are inspected prior to filling cylinders.  These written procedures are followed each time cylinders are filled.  Employees also have start-up procedures which they follow for starting the ethylene system.  Visual inspections are similar to that of the mehtyl chloride system, except for the cylinders are high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders go through a hammer test, which means the cylinders are tapped slightly with a hammer.  If there is a high ringing sound the cylinders should be in good shape.  If the sound is dull or muffled, the cylinders could have internal corrosion, or may have liquid in them.  These cylinders are not filled until they are properly inspected, and/or have the contents evacuated.  Employees conducted limited maintenance on these systems.  Maintenance, if deemed necessary, is contratcted out to qualified companies who have trained personnel to utilize in the proper maintnenace of these systems.  The mechanical integrity of the system is maintained in the manner, for these contractors have copies of, or access to the O&M manuals for both systems.  This facility has a Process Safety Managment plan which is being incorporated into the daily routine to comply with the Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.  They also have a Lock-out/Tag-out program, Hazard Communication Program, Confined Space Program (if ever needed), and an Emergency Action Plan to aid in the prevention of accidental releases for this facility.\n\nThe emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Houston LEPC (Joe Leonard, Jr.), and the Houston Fire Department."

      "SummaryText": "  If a release were to occur at this location, employees would be notified of the release.  Plant Manager (Dave Maisano) will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation.  If the operator of the system in question tried to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency electrical shutoff switch will be utilized to turn off all electricity to the pumps and components of the plant to prevent any further operation of pumping equipment.  If the release cannot be stopped, notfication to the Houston Fire Department via 911 call will be made.  The Houston Fire Department will respond to a release at this location, and are trained in HazMat operations.  This 911 call will also notify the Houston LEPC so that notification, and if needed, evacuation of the affected area can begin.\n\nThis facility has a flammable and a toxic worst case scenario.  The worst case scenarion for a toxic release would be the failure of the tractor trailer vessel storing methyl chloride.  This release, if the trailer were full) would have a release of 36,000 pounds of methyl chloride into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs.  Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario.  The distance to endpoint of 0.82 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 2.0 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered rural.  This release scenarion could impact approximately 73,000 persons in a 6 square mile radius.  This information was determined using RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nAn alternate toxic release for this location would be the most probable release; a transfer hose leak.  The transfer hoses at this location are high pressure stainless steel.  Over time, the hoses begin to get crimps, which could lead to a small hole in the transfer hose.  If this were to happen with the methyl chloride, an estimated release rate would be approximately 1 pound per minute for 10 mi"

Within this small area, there would be approximately 35 persons affected.  There are no residences in this are, so the numbers would be the surrounding office/manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe worst case flammable release for this faciloity would be an ethylene storage vessel failure.  This could release the entire contents of the ethylene vessel, resulting in a release of 80,000 pounds of ethylene.  Active mitigation for this system is similar as for the methyl chloride system.  Emergency and manual shutoffs were considered.  However, this release could have a flammable distance to endpoint of 1 psi pverpressure of 0.35 miles.  This worst case flammable scenario could impact approximately 4700 persons within the 0.38 square mile area surrounding the facility.  Again, these numbers are based on RMP Comp, and Landview III software.\n\nThe alternate flammable release scenario for this facility again would be a transfere hose release.  As indicated earlier, the hoses are high pressure stainless steel, and are very hard to damage.  The estimated amount which could be released in 10 minutes would be 5 pounds per minute.  This 50 pound release would have a distance to endpoint for the lower flammablility limit of 31 mg/l would be 0.06 miles.  This release could have an impact on the surrounding area.  Approximately 140 persons could be affected by this release.  RMP Comp, and Landview III software were utilized in determining this release scenario.\n\nThere has been an accidental release from this facility in the past five years.  This release did not occur with the ethylene or methyl chloride systems, rather methane and ethane.  These two products are not being utilized at the current time due to the damage caused by the fire.  These two products will probably be repackaged at a later date, however, the amounts should be below the miniumum thresholds for RMP requirement"
