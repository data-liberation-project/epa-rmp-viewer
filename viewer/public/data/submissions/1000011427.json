The facility treats up to 120 million gallons of water per day (MGD) from the Tolt Reservoir with filtration, ozonation, chloridation, fluoridation and the addition of lime for corrosion control. It provides about one third to one half of the water for the city of Seattle and its regional customers. The facility is also designed to conform to anticipated environmental regulations.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\u00bf\tSouth Fork Tolt river:  Supplies untreated water that is gravity fed from the Tolt Reservoir into the regulation basin and then to the facility.\r\n\u00bf\tOzone Generation: Liquid oxygen stored in tanks is vaporized and fed as a gas and is passed through an electric field and a percent is converted into ozone. Ozone, a very strong oxidant, is finely bubbled through the water to create measurable residual for primary disinfection.\r\n\u00bf\tCationic polymers and Ferric Chloride are added to further oxidize and conglomerate the solids.\r\n\u00bf\tFiltration: Six high-rate water filters are employed to remove particulates and pathogens.  Water flows down through six feet of anthracite coal filter media.  The filters are cleaned regularly by reversing the water flow (backwashing).  The backwash water is collected and routed to the Recovery Basins for clarification and particulate/solids removal and the decanted water is then returned to the plant. Solids are then removed and disposed of via land use application to farm land.\r\n\u00bf\tFinal Treatment: After filtration, chemicals are added for residual disinfection, fluoridation, and corrosion control.\r\n\u00bf\tClearwell storage consists of 7.4 million gallon buried reservoir used to store treated water and balance fluctuations in demand.

Chlorine can be added as a primary and/or secondary disinfectant during the water treatment process.  At the Tolt Treatment Facility, chlorine is added only as a secondary disinfectant to provide a chlorine residual for the water entering the distribution system.\r\n\r\nCHLORINATION PROCESS\r\n\r\nTwo banks of four chlorine containers provide an online and standby chlorine supply system. The containers are connected to a common manifold system by a 36 long flexible container connector for the gas feed.  The preset manifold pressure-drop controls an automatic switch over system using isolation valves that are also activated by the chlorine leak detectors.  When a chlorine cylinder is depleted, the switchover system automatically switches the feed to the stand-by containers.  \r\n\r\nChlorine flows through the evaporators. The gas flows through a pressure control valve and then a vacuum-regulating valve before entering the chlorinator.  The gas is drawn by vacuum into the chlorinator where the flow rate is adjusted and controlled.  The vacuum is generated by water flowing through the eductor venturi and opens the check valve in the eductor.  Gas flows through the vacuum line into the eductor where the chlorine is mixed with water and fed to the filtered water channels and/or backwash water. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\r\n(WAC 296-67-053)\r\n\r\nAmerican Water Services CDM, in cooperation with Seattle Public Utilities has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the Tolt Treatment Facility in accordance with the provisions of WAC 296-67-053, WAC 296-24-567 and 296-62 WAC, Part P.
