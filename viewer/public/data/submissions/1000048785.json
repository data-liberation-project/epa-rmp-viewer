The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The BWWB Carson Filter Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The BWWB Carson Filter Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The BWWB Carson Filter Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies.

The following details the prevention program elements at The BWWB Carson Filter Plant that apply to these processes.\n\n\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The BWWB Carson Filter Plant processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The BWWB Carson Filter Plant, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The BWWB Carson Filter Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe BWWB  Carson Filter Plant develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n\n\n4.4    Training\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n\n\n4.5    Maintenance\n\n\n\nThe BWWB "

A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The BWWB Carson Filter Plant trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n\n\n4.8    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\n\n\nIndustry standards are followed at The BWWB Carson Filter Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.

During this period of time, there was one accidental release of a listed substance that qualifies for inclusion in the Five Year Accident History section of the RMP Registration. \n\n\n\nThe incident occurred on July 30, 2014, and involved a minor employee exposure to chlorine gas. The release occurred inside the chlorine building that is equipped with a scrubber system that prevented the chlorine gas from escaping the building. According to EPA Guidelines for the Five Year Accident History, employee exposure injuries should be included in the Five Year Accident History if the injury meets the definition of an OSHA Recordable Injury. In this case, the employee was sent to the local medical clinic for observation. Because the employee did not return to work for their following normal scheduled work day, the accident would qualify as an OSHA Recordable Injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0    Emergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant has prepared a written emergency action plan that complies with the RMP Rule, other federal standards and industry guidelines.  This plan has been communicated to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and local fire department.  The BWWB Carson Filter Plant periodically conducts emergency drills to test our emergency plan and coordinate these drills with the local fire department.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe BWWB Carson Filter Plant continuously attempts to improve the safety of our processes to protect our employees, the public and the environment.  The BWWB Carson Filter Plant incident investigations, employee suggestions and improvements in technology are utilized to update the safety aspects of the processes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
