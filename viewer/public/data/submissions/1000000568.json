Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility, employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 265,000 pounds. This includes anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however,since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4.
