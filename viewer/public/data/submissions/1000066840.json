      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Atlanta Terminal consists of propane system and butane system.\n\nPropane System: The propane system is spread across west side and east side. The west side of the facility has twenty four (24) 90,000 Gallons capacity water capacity tanks. The storage tanks are underground tanks.  There are five (5) rail car unloading stations, six (6) truck unloading and 2 truck loading stations on the west side of the facility.  There is a 12,000 Gallons capacity above ground propane storage tank. The west also has four (4) vapor compressors and two (2) pumps. \n\nThe east side has ten (10), 90, 000 Gallons capacity tank and sixty (60), 30,000 Gallons Storage Propane Tanks. All propane tanks on the east side are underground tanks. There is one (1) Compressor on the east side to compress and push liquid propane from the east tanks to the west side. The propane system has the ability to load / unload propane by rail car and load / unload by transports.\n\nButane System: The Atlanta Terminal east sides consist of four (4) 30,000 gallon tanks, all above ground. There are two (2) compressors used to unload the rail cars and two (2) liquid pumps used to load butane from storage into the transport trailers. There are three (3) rail towers designed to unload the product from the cars into the storage tanks. There are one unloading station and two transport loading stations.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe same properties that make propane and butane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communities. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Logistics Managers, a Terminal Operations Supervisor who "

AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario \n\nFor flammables, vapor cloud explosion is specified as worst case scenario. Worst case scenario is analyzed by estimating distance to an over pressure endpoint of 1 psi resulting from vapor cloud explosion of a cloud containing largest quantity of regulated substance from a vessel or process pipe failure. Per CFR 68.25.b.1, \"For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity\" is the worst case scenario.\n\nAll the storage tanks in the propane system are underground tanks except a 12,000 Gallons above ground tank used to transfer products. A catastrophic rupture of underground tank is unlikely.\n\nAll the Butane Bulk Storage Tanks are aboveground tanks. Total loss of contents of one of the butane tanks was considered as the worst case scenario.  The total quantity released was 122,860 lbs. The butane was assumed to disperse in the flammable range, encounter areas of sufficient congestion and confinement and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  Per RMP Comp, the calculated distance to 1 psi overpressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.40 miles.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nFor alternative release scenario, a propane release from relief valves of a 90, 000 gallons bulk tank as result of overfilling and over pressure of the bulk tanks was considered. The release of propane through one of the ports of relief valve was 55,120 lbs. The "

Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.30 miles.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. \n\nNotification of potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire department or law enforcement after consultation with site personnel. If an actual incident occurs, the plan gives guidance to employees on how to respond if it is a minor problem and easily controlled on site. Larger emergencies require assistance from the local emergency response organizations and employees are knowledgeable as to when that outside assistance is required. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes.\n\n"
