Headquartered in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, DOT Foods, Inc. is a family owned business that has grown from a single station wagon driven by the founder, Robert Tracy, to a fleet of over 400 multi-temp tractor trailers. This growth is in large part due to the customer driven attitude that is exhibited by all the members of the DOT team.  As stated on their website, DOT Foods will continue to be driven by the values of integrity, growth, profit, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on innovation and employee welfare.\r\n\r\nDOT Foods, Inc. located in Vidalia, Georgia, provides refrigeration for warehousing and distribution of food and related products and services.  DOT Foods, Inc.'s senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also maintains a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  DOT Foods, Inc. administers safety and environmental policies at the facility to ensure compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, and the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nDOT Foods, Inc. is located at 1120 W. North St. in Vidalia, Georgia.  The facility is approximately 10 feet south of Highway 292 and 223 feet (0.04 miles) north of the Seaboard Coastline Railroad.

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers and the Thermosyphon Receiver are mounted on the roof above the machine room.  Evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe DOT Foods, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room or outside on the roof above the machine room (condensers and Thermosyphon Receiver).\r\n\r\nThere are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in the freezer, cooler, and dock areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and a visible alarm is triggered.  Ammonia sensors are located throughout the facility in the Machine Room, Dock Area, Cooler Areas, and Freezer Area.  These sensors are tied to a central computer that alarms and calls an outside alarm company.  The alarm will activate at one set concentration level.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods, Inc. - Vidalia facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable ammonia releases (> 100 pounds) over the past five years.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.    To save lives.\r\n2.    To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.    To protect the environment.\r\n4.    To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility maintains a safety committee whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The emergency coordinators are trained to call 9-1-1 in an event of an ammonia release.  The 9-1-1 operator will contact the Vidalia Fire Department.  Ammonia sensors are present in the machine room, in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  \r\n\r\nEmployees within the building are to shelter in place or evacuate to a point upwind of the facility.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed on September 9, 2004, revalidated on September 21-23, 2009 and revalidated on May 7-10, 2012 generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the DOT Foods, Inc. facility located at 1120 W.
