      "SummaryText": "In the Canton West Water Treatment Plant (WTP) we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan (RMP) into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water supply by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received in individual 1-ton cylinders, and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the water system by automatic vacuum operated feeders.  The vacuum system will help prevent the continual operation of the chlorine feed from the cylinder if there is an increase or decrease in pressure on the feed lines (if a feed line is cut or split).  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of chlorine at this plant is 4,000 pounds.  Chlorine management practices have previously maintained the chlorine inventory below the 2,500 pound regulatory limit for a RMP.\r\n\r\nOur employees conduct proper cylinder change-out procedures when cylinders are changed out.  A replacement cylinder has been ordered when the active chlorine cylinder has been reduced to less than 500 pounds of contained chlorine.  The cylinder replacement procedures are based on the Manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees also"

      "SummaryText": "review operating procedures and maintenance tasks daily, or as needed per manufacturer's recommendations.  The prevention program for this facility is a Level 2.  Lockout/tagout procedures are used to help prevent an accidental release of chlorine.  When maintenance is conducted on the chlorination system, the Water Operator (Eddie Mauldin) approves the proper installation of materials, and complete installation with final approval of changes in the system by the Mississippi State Health Department.  Any change in maintenance procedures is reviewed and approved by the same operator.  All operators at this facility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the water treatment operations.  All components of the chlorination system are visually inspected at least daily.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response (action) plan was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., Earth Consulting Group, Inc., Harcross Chemical Chlorine Response Team, the Canton Fire Department, and the Madison County Emergency Management Agency.  If a chlorine release occurs at the 115 Waterford Parkway Location, a chlorine detector will activate an outside siren system.  The water treatment plant operator detecting the alarm will notify the CMU Safety Director, Ms. Sandy Sinclair, who will get personnel organized for an emergency action.  On-duty personnel have SCBA equipment that they will use to enter the confined space (due to a potentially toxic atmosphere) in which the chlorine cylinders are stored and determine the extent of release.  They can perform an emergency action by manual shutdown of the chlorine cylinder valve.  If the release cannot be controlled by the manual valve shutdown, then the Harcross Chemical Chlorine Response Team (Hazmat Response), Madison County Emergency Management Agency, the Madison County Sheriff's Office, and the Canton Police Department of the relase.  Personnel at the 115 Waterford Parkway location, the Harcross Chlorin"

      "SummaryText": "e Response Team, the Canton Fire Department, and Madison County Emergency Management Agency will help organize the Emergency Response activities, and will start the notification and evacuation of the potentially affected population.  The release will be slowed by employees not starting the manual vent system in the chlorine room until notification to the 911 response system is made, and evacuation activities begin.  This will not prevent chlorine from being released from a cylinder, but will contain the release for some time to facilitate orderly response.  \r\n\r\nActive mitigation of a release will consist of manual shutoffs, automatic vacuum feed chlorine system shut-down, and water deluge using fire protection water hoses.  Alternative passive mitigation would consist of continued release into the enclosed space of the chlorine building pending emergency response.  It is assumed that the contents of the cylinder would be released as vapor, as there is no activity involving the liquid port on the chlorine cylinder.  The area surrounding the facility is generally rural and consists of relatively flat ground with sparse vegetation.  There are commercial and public facilities near the water treatment plant that will be notified as required. \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents of accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past 5 years.  The automatic vacuum feed system helps prevent/limit potential releases of chlorine that could escape during operational periods.  Operators of the chlorination system are required to check instruments, cylinders, feed lines, etc. on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of accidental releases.  Even though this is a Level 2 Prevention Program, Canton Municipal Utilities utilizes a Level 3 Process Safety Management Program to further empha efforts to prevent accidental releases of chlorine."
