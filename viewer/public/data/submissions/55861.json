Medical emergencies will require notification of the Summit Health Systems: Akron City Hospital and associated City of Akron - Bureau of Emergency Medical Services via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and emergency response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Sunoco Logistics - Akron Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline and diesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquefied butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines to the truck loading rack).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, 1 x 60,000 gallon vessel, the blending skid, sampling unit (Bartec-Benke), and the truck off-loading station product connection point.  The Facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the blending system's 60,000 gallon liquefied (pressure) butane vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shut-off device at 85% with an alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This is the recommended scenario based on the EPA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  The Facility's alternate scenario (unlikely) resulting in a substantive release based on discussion with Texon/MCE and terminal personnel capable of off-site effects is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) resulting in an explosion and associated fireball.  Other alternatives considered included pump failure, liquid butane pipe failure, and a truck pull-away incident.  These scenarios we"

The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering-in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Akron Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the City of Akron Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the City of Akron Fire Department and the Summit County EMA.  The City of Akron Fire Department also maintains a full hazardous material response team, is aware of the Facility's butane blending system access via Home Avenue, and sources (hydrants available adjacent to the Terminal).  Sunoco Logistics - Akron Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system."
