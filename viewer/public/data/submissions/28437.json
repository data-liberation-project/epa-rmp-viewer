HBCC trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  HBCC's Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nHBCC\u00bfs emergency response policy is contained in its current written Hazardous Materials Business Plan.  HBCC considers the City of Industry facility to be a non-responding facility under 40 CFR 68.90 and Section 2765.1 of CalARP.  A designated Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate EC initiate emergency notifications and evacuations.  All employees are trained in their appropriate role in emergency response and proper procedures for awareness level response.  The City of Industry facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  A fire station, located within a 1/2 mile of the facility, is used for initial emergency response.  HBCC contracts with a qualified hazardous materials management company for secondary response and proper disposition of hazardous materials and wastes generated during an incident.\n\n\nGeneral Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nHBCC's City of Industry facility was established in the mid-1950's as a distribution and repackaging center for chemicals.  The facility stores, repackages, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also stores and distributes 150-pound chlorine cylinders to customers.  Other chemicals stored or managed at the facility are outside of the scope of the Federal RMP pro"

The NAICS code for the chlorine warehouse process is 42269 Other Chemical and Allied Products Wholesalers.\n\nThe site covers an area of approximately 180,000 square feet with two main warehouses, and office building and storage tanks in the yard.  The facility is bounded on the South by Clark Avenue, on the North by a Metrolink railway, on the West by South 9th Avenue, and on the East by commercial and light industrial facilities.\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Repackaging and Railcar Unloading\n\nBulk shipments of anhydrous ammonia are off-loaded to a bulk storage tank from HBCC-owned tank trucks or from supplier tank trucks.  The anhydrous ammonia system is configured to fill individual cylinders of varying capacity (50 lb, 100 lb, and 150 lb) as dictated by customer needs or from a railcar into a tank truck for transport to customer sites.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the neutralization of plant wastewater before discharge to the city sewer.  All uses of anhydrous ammonia on-site are at ambient temperature with system pressures varying accordingly.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is an inorganic toxic gas, liquefied under pressure and stored at ambient temperature at the facility.  It is a stable, colorless gas or liquid with an extremely pungent odor.  It is a strong irritant to eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and the respiratory system.  The National Fire Protection Association ranks the health hazards of ammonia as high.  Anhydrous ammonia has a very high auto-ignition temperature and is difficult to ignite.  Nonetheless, heat and ignition sources are avoided.\n\n\nChlorine\n\nCity of Industry facility serves only as a distribution point for pre-packaged 150-lb chlorine cylinders.  These cylinders are received at the northeast corner of the warehouse loading dock.   Cylinders are restrained by chains and are stored outdoors beneath the warehouse canopy.  Gener"

The chlorine is shipped in cylinders compliant with DOT requirements.\n\nChlorine is a stable greenish-yellow gas or clear, amber colored liquid with a suffocating, pungent, irritating odor.  The National Fire Protection Association ranks the health hazards of this substance as high.  Chlorine is non-flammable but many metals ignite in the presence of chlorine.  This substance is stored away from heat and ignition sources.\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses Results\n\nHBCC assessed the quantity of regulated substances in the warehouse processes by reviewing storage capacities, production information, and Tier 2 reports submitted annually under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Next, release scenarios were identified that reach a toxic endpoint off-site.  An endpoint is a concentration of the regulated substance listed by the Federal government to establish population zones that would be vulnerable to impacts from an accidental release of the substance.  HBCC used USEPA\u00bfs RMP*Comp model as the method for determining the distance to an endpoint and, in the worst-case scenario, for identifying which release from the facility would result in the greatest distance to a receptor.  The model results in very conservative distances to endpoints.\n\n\nSummary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHBCC's release prevention program complies with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements.  HBCC's prevention program emphasizes risk management thorough use of equipment rated for ammonia service; training for its employees in hazard communication; proper operating procedures for the repackaging of anhydrous ammonia; level, pressure and temperature limits for process equipment and storage tanks; implementation of programs to maintain the mechanical integrity of equipment; internal auditing and inspect"

Two trained operators are always present during bulk transfer to ensure safe operation and movement of trucks on the property and the integrity of hoses used for filling.  HBCC operators are always present during repackaging operations to observe pressure and temperature gauges on tanks and pipes and to be alert for any releases of pressure relief valves installed on tanks or hydrostats on piping systems.  \n\nIn accordance with DOT requirements, valve assemblies on anhydrous ammonia cylinders are inspected upon each return for refilling.  Faulty valves are rebuilt or replaced.  The date stamped for hydrostatic testing of cylinders is checked and each cylinder is repainted for corrosion protection before refilling.\n\nHBCC trains their operators carefully before allowing them to take the lead in repackaging operations.  A key training method for process operations involves on-the-job supervision over extended time periods, using repeated demonstration of correct process steps in accordance with written procedures.  HBCC's Operations Manager (and Emergency Coordinator) for the City of Industry facility has worked there for over 30 years and has substantial experience in dealing safely with anhydrous ammonia and chlorine cylinders.\n\nWith respect to the chlorine cylinder warehouse process, HBCC's standard operating procedures include routine observation of container integrity during loading and unloading of these cylinders.  For example, two people are always present during loading and unloading to ensure safe container handling using forklifts or hand trucks.  Cylinders are stored upright, caps on, and strapped or chained in accordance with OSHA requirements for compressed gases."

The facility has an excellent safety record.  \n\n\nSummary of the Emergency Response Program\n\nHBCC's City of Industry facility has a written Hazardous Materials Business Plan (Emergency Response Plan).  The plan designates an Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate.  All employees receive awareness-level emergency response training, first aid, and hazard communication training.\n\nHBCC's plan calls for its personnel to be alert for releases and other emergencies, notify the Fire Department for response, and evacuate the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia releases are detected through strategically placed detectors and the human sense of smell.  HBCC will immediately contact the Fire Department for response upon detecting a release.  The EC, in conjunction with the Fire Department, will determine whether the release can be promptly and safely controlled and whether off-site populations will be affected. HBCC personnel are instructed to take only safe and reasonable steps to stop minor leaks from ammonia pipes or tanks at the facility.  No such leaks have occurred in more than 10 years.  \n\nImmediately after discovering a release of chlorine, HBCC personnel are instructed to notify the Fire Department for initial response and evacuate the facility to a safe staging location upwind of the release.
