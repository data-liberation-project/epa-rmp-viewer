Our goals are to promote and strengthen mutual understanding and deepen trust in what we do.\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Polymer Drive Site implements these policies through site-specific programs and procedures.\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe BASF Corporation Chattanooga Polymer Drive Site uses 1,3 Butadiene. This chemical is used to manufacture a water based emulsion polymer or dispersion. This dispersion is used primarily as a binder in carpet backing. The plant also makes products for paper coating and adhesive applications.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, and the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe site had a release of Butadiene vapor after a hose used for loading from a railcar to the site Butadiene storage tank was left attached to the Drylok fitting on the railcar and not emptied properly per procedure.  The Butadiene that was left inside the hose experienced thermal expansion due to the heat of the day.  The calculated amount inside the hose was 15.0lbs.  Offsite response from Chattanooga Fire Department worked with BASF onsite emergency responders that are Hazwoper trained. The  following agencies were notified of the incident Chattanooga-Hamilton County Air Pollution Control Bureau, National Response Center, and Hamilton County LEPC.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the community plan.  Hazmat team members are trained and participate in drills regularly.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, etc.\n\nFor example,"
