During the suit-up drills, which are conducted annually, mock cylinders are used to simulate a release.  In addition, B Kits are used for practice on a quarterly basis.  The local police, fire, and hazardous materials agencies have been integrated into the facility response plan.\n\nIn the event of an emergency on the chlorine system, authorized staff will attempt to isolate the cause of the emergency by activating the Emergency Shutoff System first and notify management and the local authorities, as necessary.  The in-house HazMat Team will wear the proper safety equipment (a positive, pressure-demand, full-face piece, self contained, breathing apparatus or pressure demand supply air respirator with escape and a fully encapsulated, chemical resistant suit is required for response) prior to entering the emergency location.\n\nIn order to perform an emergency shutdown, an operator or authorized employee will activate the Emergency Shutoff System switch located outside of the Chlorine Storage Building.  The procedure is detailed in the Emergency Planning & Response section of Volume I of the PSM/RMP manual.  A chlorine specific alarm tone will sound over the Public Address system.  The alarm could mean there is a chlorine leak, but not necessarily.\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nSweetwater Authority personnel inspect the system on a daily basis, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.

However, the facility did have an incident investigation in regards to chlorine. The facility received overpressurized cylinders from Thatcher. The facility was receiving chlorine with air which caused chlorine evaporator issues and reliquification and freezing in the vacuum regulating system to cause chlorine to vent out of the chlorine room. The chlorine vacuum regulating system was rebuilt and rupture discs were replaced. Cylinder pressures were approximately 120 psig during winter conditions when pressure should have been 60 psig due to the ambient weather conditions. The facility had issues starting in October 2022. \n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nThere have been no accidents in the last 5-year accident history for this facility that meet the above definition based on the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation on April 2, 2024, there have been no significant releases of aqueous ammonia that met the California standard of \u0093any significant release\u0094 nor that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 1000 pounds of aqueous ammonia or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material in the last five years (April 2019 \u0096 April 2024).

The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of chlorine and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine gas detectors are located in the Chlorine Storage Room, the Chlorinator Room, the Chlorine Dioxide Room, Chlorine Dioxide Day Tank Area, and the lower staircase.  There are also smoke and heat detectors located throughout the facility.\n\nAqueous Ammonia System\n\nThe storage of aqueous ammonia at the Sweetwater Authority facility is governed by many safety features.  Much of the safety of the process is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the process.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program 1.  The aqueous ammonia system is checked by operators on a daily basis.\n\nSweetwater Authority maintains tight control of its aqueous ammonia system through various process controls and monitors.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of aqueous ammonia, there is a containment basin surrounding the aqueous ammonia tank that can hold more than 144% of the tank's liquid capacity.\n\nD. \tFive Year Accident History\n\nThe EPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n-\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n-\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\n\nChlorine System\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facili"

The aqueous ammonia is stored in a 6,000-gallon storage tank, which is located within a containment berm.  Two feed pumps are used to draw aqueous ammonia from the Storage Tank, which is then transferred to the effluent for water treatment.\n\nThe maximum total inventory of up to 29% aqueous ammonia is 46,260 pounds (6,000 gallons). \n\nC. \tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nChlorine System\n\nIn order to operate the chlorine water treatment system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Level 3; and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 3.\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Sweetwater Authority to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the facility. The Operating Procedures program ensures that the chlorine system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the chlorine system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.

The Safety Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\nB. \tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sweetwater Authority facility uses a chlorine system to treat water.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to purify the water.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one ton containers, which are then connected to the water treatment system, as needed.  The liquid chlorine leaves the one ton containers and enters the evaporators, which turn the liquid chlorine into a gas.  The chlorine gas then proceeds to the chlorinators, where it is pulled into the injectors, which then sends the chlorine into the water distribution system.\n\nIn the Chlorine Storage Room at Sweetwater Authority there are two chlorine tanks connected to the chlorine system (only one is used at a time).  The controller in the Chlorine Storage Room monitors the weight of each one ton chlorine container.  When the tank in operation is close to empty, the controller shuts off the valve connected to that tank and opens the valve connected to the full tank.  The empty tank is then replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by Sweetwater Authority operators using the monorail hoist.\n\nThe maximum total chlorine inventory is 32,000 p"
