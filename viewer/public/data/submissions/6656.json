      "SummaryText": "The Miller Street Wastewater Treatment Facility has been in operation within the Orange Park community since 1974. We have developed in response to EPA's RMP rule, a prevention and emergency response program.  Clay County has used the most current design requirements to ensure the safest operation. The entire disinfection system is under cover to prevent the weather from compromising the integrity of the equipment.  The entire delivery system is under vacuum.  Therefore, if a leak occurs in the delivery system, no disinfectant will be released into the air, but rather air will be pulled into the system.  The Utility Authority will be instituting routine inspections and maintenance of the system, which will help prevent any problems before they occur.  The Utility Authority has a Chlorine Response Team on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Leak detects have been placed in the building where the process is housed. If the alarm is tripped, a member of the Response Team is notified by telecommunication immediately.  The Utility has also participated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) so as to help protect the community.  While the worst-case release scenarios indicate that offsite areas would be affected, we believe that our recently instituted safety procedures will reduce the likelihood of such event and that the alternative case release scenarios more accurately reflect the most probable occurrence.  Clay County Utility Authority has not had a reported leak since the beginning of operation at the Miller Street WWTF and we hope to continue our outstanding safety record.  If anyone has any further questions or needs more information please contact the, Clay County Utility Authority."
