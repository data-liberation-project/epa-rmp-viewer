BOX 56554\nLAKE PARK, MN  56554\n\nGARY DIVISION\n\nFor further information contact Michael Larson, Manager, 218-356-8515\n\nRisk Management Plan- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC  are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activitiy at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 150,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85 percent capacity (130,000 pounds) over a 10 minute time period.  According to TFI Guidance Tables, the distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("

      "SummaryText": "OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition Minnesota Department of Ag rules are followed.\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of propane or anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). \nc.  Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations or propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
