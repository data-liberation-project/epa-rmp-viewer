Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Spoetzl Brewery, located in Shiner, Texas is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent the release of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nB. Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Spoetzl Brewery produces and packages Shiner beer. The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning for beer/intermediates tank storage and various brewing process areas. The system also provides cooling to generate chilled water or glycol through flooded heat exchangers which, in turn, supplies secondary media and/or direct product cooling.\r\n\r\nWe use and store quantities of Anhydrous Ammonia in excess of 10,000 pounds in our refrigeration system. The industry has used Anhydrous Ammonia for many years as a coolant because it is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and has an exceptional ability to remove large quantities of heat. Although it is designated as an Extremely Hazardous Substance by the Environmental Protection Agency if stored, and handled, properly it is relatively safe to use as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nC. Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nSpoetzl Brewery has adopted a program to meet the requirements of both the Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and the EPA's RMP standard. Spoetzl Brewery maintains a release prevention program with the focus of protecting the public, employees, and the environment from hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe multi-faceted program includes:\r\n\r\n* The use of Process Safety Information to document safe process design;\r\n* Operating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\r\n* Maintenance, inspection and testing of all am"
