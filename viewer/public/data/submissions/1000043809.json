      "SummaryText": "Located in southeastern Pennsylvania, the Borough of West Chester is the county seat of Chester County and is an industrial and commercial center with approximately 18,000 residents.  The Borough of West Chester covers an area of approximately 1.9 square miles and lies across two watersheds: Goose Creek, a tributary of the Chester Creek, and Taylor Run, a tributary of the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek.\n\n\n\nThe Borough of West Chester maintains two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), one serving each watershed.  The Taylor Run WWTP was built in 1984 and is capable of treating 1.8 million gallons per day to the level required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of a WWTP is to protect public waterways from environmental harm and to promote the recreational, commercial, and/or industrial use of these waterways.  The WWTP helps to achieve and maintain water quality goals by achieving a high degree of treatment of all incoming wastewater prior to discharge to Taylor Run.\n\n\n\nAll incoming wastewater is disinfected by using chlorine to kill any pathogenic organisms before discharging the water.  A maximum of 2,500 pounds of chlorine (one full one-ton container and one partially full one-ton container (maximum of 500 pounds)) is stored on site at any one time.  When the container with 500 pounds in it becomes empty, the full one-ton container is put into operation leaving on full container on line and one empty container next to it.  When the on-line container reaches the 500 pound level, an order is placed with the chlorine supplier for one full one-ton container to replace the empty one-ton container.  As a result of this operating procedure, no more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine is ever on site at any given time.  The containers are located in a brick building designed specifically and solely for the safe movement, storage and use of chlorine.\n\n\n\nTaylor Run WWTP's ac"

      "SummaryText": "cidental release prevention program is designed to ensure that the facility operates in compliance with the RMP Rule and with industry standards of performance, such as the guidance documents written by the Chlorine Institute.  The prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n\n\n - High level of training of the operators\n\n - Preventive maintenance program\n\n - Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n - Use of accurate and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n\n - Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n - Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\n\n\nPreventive maintenance is regularly scheduled and performed.  Trained, experienced vendors clean, service and replace pipes, valves, chlorinators, rotameters and other equipment, as needed.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), available for use by operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas is fed into the wastewater with vacuum operated equipment, which offer the safest operation for low capacities.  Piping and connections are kept to a minimum for safety.  The piping was designed to be the shortest necessary length, and is properly supported and protected from risks of excessive heat or fire.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n\n\nTaylor Run WWTP is not required to maintain a site-specific emergency response program, as defined by OSHA and EPA.  However, it does have an Emergency Plan which has been coordinated with the LEPC, which gives specific details regarding emergency contacts, potentially affected areas, evacuation routes, and other information regarding the WWTP.  The WWTP would contact the local fire department and the Chester County Local Emergency Planning "
