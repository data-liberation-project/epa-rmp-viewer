The properties which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. McLane strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations. Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies. We work in conjunction with the Kissimmee Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods. We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing. Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The regulated substance used at our facility is anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration?.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nTo date, this McLane DC facility has not incurred a reportable releases in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT P"

      "SummaryText": "ROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by Mr. Kenneth Wilde.  He will administrate in conjunction with the McLane Distribution management and personnel. Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Kissimmee Fire Department and Hazmat team.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe McLane DC facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom plus On-The-Job training (OJT).  They are given written tests and are observed by senior maintenance in order to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nMcLane SunEast is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Osceola Public Safety/Kissimmee Fire Department which will contact Polk or Orange County Hazmat Teams in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nContinued training and program reviews are some of the steps that will be taken to improve safety."
