Refrigeration system components are located in areas that are not as likely to become damaged (i.e., tanks and pipe runs are placed away and protected from forklift and truck traffic).\n\n2.0  Source and regulated substances handled (?68.155(b)).\n\nApproximately 16,477 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on site at Beaver Street Fisheries.  The EPA requires a Risk Management Plan be developed and maintained when the total amount of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  No other substances, in quantities subject to EPA RMP certification requirements, are located at the Beaver Street Fisheries facility.\n\n3.0  Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios (?68.155(c)).\n\n3.1 Beaver Street Fisheries topography is described as \"Urban\", and is entered into the dispersion models as the surface roughness parameter.   \n\n3.2  Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe ammonia high pressure receiver, located inside the engine room, contains the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia, on site, on a predictable worst case basis.  This tank holds approximately 3,289 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia when 30% full, under an internal pressure and temperature of approximately 160 psig and 85 ?F, and is used to recharge the system. The Worst Case Scenario as required by EPA, assumes that the tank's contents are fully released as a gas/vapor over a 10-minute period.\n\nSince the release would occur within the reinforced walls of the engine room, approximately 181 lbs/min (329 x 55%) of ammonia would be predicted to be released.\n\nThe EPA's OCA guidance reference tables predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability"

Approximately 581 people, in the surrounding community, reside within the radius to the toxic endpoint (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia). There are churches, schools, an open-air farmers market and residences within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n \n3.3  Alternate Case Scenario (ACS)\n\nThe Alternate Case, more likely, Release Scenario for Beaver Street Fisheries was selected to involve a relief valve release on the high pressure receiver.  The relief valve discharges outside the engine room.  Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 psi and 113 ?F) was estimated to have a flow rate from the relief valve (inner orifice diameter: 0.75 inches) of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from an ammonia gas release table.  It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained operators onsite, with a corresponding anhydrous ammonia quantity released of approximately 920 lbs.\n\nThe EPA's OCA guidance reference tables predicted, with a wind speed of 3 mph and atmospheric stability class F, that the anhydrous ammonia release may travel approximately 0.19 miles. Landview approximated 139 people resided within the release radius (level of concern = 200 ppm, anhydrous ammonia) of the facility. There are churches, a school, an open-air farmers market and residences within the radius to the toxic endpoint.\n \n4.0  Accidental release prevention program (?68.155(d)).\n\nBeaver Street Fisheries standard policy requires daily monitoring and inspection of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system by trained employees, or contracted services personnel, in accordance with OSHA and IIAR guidelines.  Accidental release prevention practices at Beaver Street Fisheries include:\n\n? Annual operator refresher training.\n? Routine preventative maintenance and inspections.\n? Refrigeration system repairs made in a pro"

Constant monitoring of the system.\n\n5.0  5 year accident history (?68.155(e)).\n\nNo releases or accidents, involving anhydrous ammonia, that are reportable in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP Rule), have occurred at this facility.\n\n6.0  Emergency response program (?68.155(f)).\n\n6.1  During normal workday operation, the facility emergency response plan consists of employee notification (public address system) and evacuation, followed by notification of the Jacksonville Fire Department District #17 or Hazmat Response District # 7  by dialing \"9-1-1\".  Atlantic West Tec security monitoring company ((904) 743-4440) receives an alarm whenever an emergency plant shutdown occurs.\n\n6.2  Red Cross shelter resources in the Jacksonville area consist of pre-arranged service agreements with local schools and some local churches.  Schools and churches that would serve as a Red Cross shelter would have food, cots, and first aid supplies on site.  Those in need of medical attention would be taken to a nearby hospital.  \n\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety (?68.155(g)).\n\nFuture plans to improve anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system safety at Beaver Street Fisheries consist of:\n\n? Coordinating a written emergency response plan with the Jacksonville Fire Department and a nearby HAZMAT emergency response contractor;\n? Annual HAZMAT Technician, and Incident Commander training;\n? Resolving OSHA PSM Action Items and Emergency Response Action Items;\n? Completing PSM program elements on an on going basis."
