This program requires\nfacilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal\nRisk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\nThe City of Carrollton is subject to this regulations as the owner and operator of the Carrollton Water\nTreatment Plant located at 1007 North Park Street, Carrollton, (Carroll Country), Georgia.  This facility\nis a stationary source of chlorine ( a regulated substance) in excess of 2,500 pounds.\n\nA RMProgram has been developed to meet the intent of the regulations for this facility using Program 2.\nInformation from the Federal Register, AWWA's Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management\nProgram for Water Treatment Plants, and EPS's Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater\nTreatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68) were used as resources for the development of this program.\n\nThe Carrollton Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine in its potable water treatment process to disinfect\nsurface water obtained from raw water reservoirs.  The chlorination process includes the storage\nof up to eight (8) 1-ton cylinders of liquid/gaseous chlorine.  The process is located within a closed\nbuilding utilizing a vacuum feed system, instrumentation, process specific piping and connection\nmaterials.\n\nA hazard assessment was conducted at the facility to determine the past history of accidents or re-\nleases of chlorine.  Plant records and interviews with current plant personnel indicated there have been\nno releases of chlorine in the past five years that resulted in injury, death or property damage.\n\nIn compliance with the regulations, a worst-case release scenario was modeled using the EPA\nRMPComp dispersion model to determine the potentail impact of such a release.  The worst-case\nscenario assumes that a "

The model predicted that areas within a 1.3 mile radius of the plant could be ad-\nversely affected by such a release.  This area includes public receptors such as private residences,\nschools, churches and places of business.\n\nAn alternative-case scenario was also modeled using RMPComp to model the effects of a more\nprobable release.  This scenario involved a valve failure resulting in the release of 200 pounds of chlorine in a time frame of 10 minutes with the distance to end point being 0.3 miles."
