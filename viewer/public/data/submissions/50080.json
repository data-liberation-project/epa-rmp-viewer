Lamb-Weston is committed to providing its employees and the surrounding community with a safe and healthy environment. The Risk Management Program is an integral part of our strong commitment to \"sustainable development\", which means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable development requires reductions in the generation of wastes and pollutants, protection of clean air and clean water, sustainable protection of the land, and the wise use of energy. It requires employee commitment, strategic thinking, innovation, the involvement of our suppliers, new technology and enhanced production processes.\n\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\nThe Pasco, Washington processing facility produces various potato products such as french fries of various shapes and seasonings. The plant site consists of a main processing plant, raw potato storage buildings, general maintenance facility, boiler/refrigeration facility, primary water treatment facility, and refrigerated cold storage. Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\n\nThe potato processing cycle includes a wide array of steps. The plant purchases the majority of its potatoes from local growers. Since potatoes have a single growing season, they must be held under controlled storage conditions. Prior to processing, the potatoes are separated by size and processing specification. The inspected, washed, peeled, and hand-trimmed potatoes are cut, blanched and fried. The final products are frozen, packaged and prepared for shipping.\n\n1.30 General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nConAgra Foods Lamb Weston's accident prevention/loss control systems and"

The OSHA-PSM and the EPA-RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled to the best of our ability, and that the processes are meeting health and safety objectives.\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is comprised of the 13 elements of OSHA's PSM program: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Operating Procedures, Hot Work Permits, Employee Training, Incident Investigation, Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Planning and Response, Contractor Safety, and Audits.\n\nEmployee participation brought together people that knew and understood the system, from practical experience as well as their technical knowledge, to develop the Plan. Process safety information is a collection of data that allows us to identify and understand the hazards posed by our inventory. Representatives from our skilled work force and Lamb-Weston management, who understood the process being analyzed including the engineering behind the covered process, conducted the process hazard analysis. This analysis identifies potential process failures that could result in an uncontrolled release of ammonia.\n\nIn order to safely manage changes that need to be made to the processes containing ammonia, a system of checks and balances has been established. This system will evaluate safety prior to the work being done, and provide a solid review of the system to assure that once started, it will run as designed. Standard operating procedures are in place for each operating phase and are readily accessible to those workers who operate or maintain the process. In Addition, a policy and procedure are used to assure that proper safety precautions are taken for all personnel performing Hot work. The integrity of the refrigeration system equipment is maintained acc"

The facility also has a training program for all employees and contractors regarding the hazards of the chemical and safe work practices to be used. Part of this training includes monthly safety meetings as well as drills on spill response and plant evacuation.\n\nAny incidents related to the ammonia refrigeration systems are promptly investigated even though the rules only requires investigation of those incidents, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release. All incidents are analyzed, resolved, and findings shared with affected employees. In order to assure compliance with all elements of the prevention program, an audit is conducted every three years including a report of the findings and documentation of any deficiencies corrected.\n\n\n1.40 Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at the Pasco, Washington facility in the last five years from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n1.50 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Pasco, Washington facility has an emergency action plan which has been coordinated (reviewed) with the Pasco Fire Department and Franklin County Emergency Services. Both are members of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee.\n\nThe plan applies to all ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston employees, visitors, and support service contractors performing tasks and activities as part of ongoing operations.

In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\n\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the ConAgra Foods Lamb Weston Pasco, Washington facility and defines the following:\n\n?    How to conduct activities in a manner that protects the safety of employees, the public, and the environment\n?    Preferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies\n?    Emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments\n?    Procedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors\n?    Names of agencies and persons to contact for further assistance, information, or explanation of the plan\n\n1.60 Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe Pasco, Washington facility takes seriously its responsibility for the safety of its employees, neighbors, and community. Central to this responsibility are our programs to prevent the release of chemicals to the environment. We will continue to implement these precautions and programs, to act as a responsible neighbor, and to maintain the goodwill of the community."
