General accidental release and prevention policy of Merchants Terminal.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\nthe environment.  It is our policy at Merchants terminal Corporation to implement the\nrequirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full\ncompliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by. The\nobjective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials. Safety depends\ndirectly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant personnel have been trained on the\nequipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility\nto prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nMerchants Terminal Corporation, 501 N. Kresson Street, Baltimore, Maryland is responsible for\nthe storage and distribution of various frozen food products. Merchants Terminal is located in an\nindustrial area of suburban Baltimore. In addition to our facility the surrounding community\nhouses other commercial businesses as well as residential areas.\nThere are approximately 22 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel. \nThis distribution facility receives and prepares shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products\nvia tractor trailers approximately 10 hours a day, five days a week.  \n\nThe potentially hazardous chemical used at the Merchants Terminal facility is Anhydrous"
