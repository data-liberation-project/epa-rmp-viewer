We are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfering of anhydrous ammonia to our customers in a mannner so they may use anhydrous ammonia in an effective manner. The maximum quantity stored at our facility is 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in our storage tank. \n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the largest storage tank has a gas, over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represetnts the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint is 2.5 miles. The alternative release scenerio based on industry records and  the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles.\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record. Over the past five years we have had no off-sight or on-sight reportable accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. This is due to the pro-active approach our firm has taken in handling this product. We have trained and tested not only our employee group but management has also taken advanced training in handling and maintenace of anhydrous ammonia equipment.\n\nWe are heavily regulated by DOT, OSHA, EPA and The Kansas Department of Agriculture in the proper handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addtion we coordinate our safety efforts with our community emergency personnel. This effort includes but is not limited to emergency action plan and annual chemical reporting of our inventories.  We are proud of all of the efforts our firm has made and ou"
