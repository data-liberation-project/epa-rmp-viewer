      "SummaryText": "Mesquite Generating Station\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\nManagement System\r\nThe Mesquite Generating Station management system for implementation of the risk management program elements is described below. The Environmental Scientist/Engineer  has overall responsibility for the risk management program at the Mesquite Generating Station.\r\n  \r\nThe development and implementation of the risk management program tasks will be performed by the following plant staff:  the Plant Engineer, Operations and Maintenance Manager(s), who report to the Plant Manager. The Shift Leads, operation technicians, and maintenance technicians report to the Operations and to the Maintenance Manager(s).  Staff members will be responsible for accomplishing RMP program requirements as work activities assigned to their positions.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia Regulated Substance and Process Description\r\nThe prevention program for the Mesquite Generating Station covers the anhydrous ammonia storage and injection systems for the two identical Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems used in each of the two Power Blocks.  This RMP prevention program covers the following processes and regulated substance:\r\nProcesses 1 & 2: Ammonia storage and injection to the SCR system\r\nRegulated Substance: Anhydrous Ammonia\r\nProcess #1 is the system for Power Block #1, and Process #2 is the system for Power Block #2.  The ammonia systems procedures are contained in the Mesquite Generating Station Policies and Procedures Manual (PPM) 9.21, titled Ammonia Storage and Transfer System.\r\n\r\nProcess Chemistry:  The two identical SCR systems in Power Blocks #1 and #2 are designed to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the combustion turbine exhaust gases.  Ammonia vapor is diluted and injected into the exhaust gas ducts upstream of the catalyst beds.  The exhaust gas mixes with the ammonia vapor and flows over the catalyst beds, where the NOx is reduced to nitrogen gas and water vapor:\r\n\r\n\t\tNOx  +  NH3  -->   N2  +"

      "SummaryText": "H2O   \r\n\r\nThe system uses anhydrous ammonia, which is delivered by tank truck to a bulk storage tank in each Power Block, where the ammonia is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure. When ammonia is needed in the SCR systems, liquid ammonia is taken from the bottom of a storage tank. The vapor is fed into a 40,000 CFM dilution air stream and injected into the duct as approximately 2.6% ammonia by volume.\r\n\r\nMaximum Planned Inventory: In each of the two Power Blocks, the gross tank volume is 14,000 gallons but a tank will only be filled to a maximum of 85% of capacity, or 12,000 gallons (61,500 lbs at 60 degrees F.), to allow for expansion. The liquid ammonia in 30 feet of 2 inch pipe from a storage tank to its vaporizer inlets, plus 15 to 20 feet of 2 inch fill pipe connected to a tank, is less than 1 pound. The quantity of ammonia in pipes connected to a tank is negligible compared to the tank contents.  The maximum planned inventory for anhydrous ammonia is 61,500 lbs. in each Power Block, or 123,000 lbs for the plant.  The quantity of ammonia in the delivery trucks is not included because the tractors will not be disconnected from the tank trailers during delivery, keeping them under DOT jurisdiction.   A full load of ammonia in a delivery truck is 44,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems \r\nIn addition to the relief systems described above, the anhydrous ammonia system includes the safety and alarm systems described below: \r\n\r\nAmmonia leak detection sensors, consisting of one per truck unloading skid, one per unloading compressor, 4 per tank, and one per vaporizer, monitor the level of ammonia in the atmosphere.  If ammonia is detected above the Low PEL alarm level of 25 ppm, a flashing strobe light is activated at the main leak detection control panel located on the truck unloading skid, and a remote alarm is activated in the plant DCS system to alert control room personnel of a potential leak.   If ammonia is detected above the High PEL alarm level of 50 ppm, a flashin"
