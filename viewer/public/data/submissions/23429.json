      "SummaryText": "The Praxair facility at Kingman, Arizona is an electronics gas plant that handles and/or stores the following substances that are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program rule, in excess of their threshold quantity:\n   ? Silane (15,000 pounds); \n   ? Trichlorosilane (80,000 pounds); and\n   - Ammonia, anhydrous (14,000).\n\nThe Kingman facility receives the substances listed above in bulk form, stores them in large tanks or tube trailers, and then transfills them into smaller containers (cylinders) for distribution to customers.  All of the products from the Kingman facility are distributed by truck. \n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scenario that represents all regulated flammable substances at the Kingman facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Kingman facility, the Worst Case Scenario involving a regulated flammable substance would be the failure of the silane tube trailer, which holds about 13,250 pounds of product.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.19 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nPraxair is also required to report a Worst Case Scenario that represents all toxic substances.  The toxic Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest ammonia vessel in our process.  We are not required to identify a possible cause of this worst"

The release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute time period, and under the most stable atmospheric and weather conditions, which minimizes the dispersion and dilution of the release and presents the absolute worst case that could possibly occur.  Given all of these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified toxic endpoint, which is defined to be a concentration of 200 ppm for ammonia.  At the Kingman facility, the largest ammonia vessel contains about 8,760 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum downwind distance of about 1.7 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"\n\nThe rule requires the reporting of an Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, that represents all of the flammable substances covered, and another Alternative Release Scenario that represents all the toxic substances covered.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the flammable processes at the Kingman facility, a credible rel"

An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as joint or a valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Kingman facility, a credible release of silane would result in the released gas spontaneously igniting resulting in a jet fire.  A release of trichlorosilane could result in a flash fire or vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoints for these scenarios would be less than 0.06 miles, or 317 feet.  Both of the covered processes at the Kingman facility are more than 900 feet from the nearest property line; therefore, the consequences of the alternative release scenarios does not have any offsite impact.  To determine these distances we used the EPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\"\n\nFor the one toxic covered process, the ammonia refrigeration process, all of the alternative release scenarios would be equivalent to a release from a small hole (1/4\" diameter) in a tank or pipe containing ammonia at the highest system pressure.  At the Kingman facility, a release of this type would result in a maximum downwind distance of about 0.2 miles, or 1,060 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Kingman facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n? Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n?

In the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.

The company operates under an umbrella of global corporate policies with specific program elements defined on a regional basis. As the result of recent acquisitions, detailed process safety audits have been conducted at numerous facilities throughout the company.

Root Cause Analysis training is being targeted within the operations and safety organizations. On a broader scale, the effectiveness, and accessibility of training is being improved. A computerized compliance management system keeps track of plant progress meeting internal and external requirements.
