(NuStar) is committed to the safety of our employees, surrounding community, and the environment and the Jacksonville Terminal achieved OSHA VPP Star status in the Fall of 2016. It is NuStar's policy to comply with all federal, state, and local laws as well as accepted industry practice for the storage and handling of butane and other liquefied petroleum gases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility. \n\n\n\nII. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNuStar's Jacksonville facility is a \"for hire\" bulk liquid terminal. The facility handles butane as a service for a customer. The butane is delivered to the terminal in railcars. At our customer's direction, the butane is blended into gasoline stored in tanks at the facility. Once the desired gasoline formulation is achieved, the gasoline is shipped out of the facility by truck. Butane may be \"stored\" at the facility in railcars for a limited amount of time depending on our customer's demand for the product. The terminal does not currently operate any permanent butane storage and does not have any regulated toxic substances.  The facility is a Program 3 level facility.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe NuStar facility will continue to address the RMP release prevention program with the following elements.\n\n-    Training: Employees are trained in the safe handling of all products stored at the facility, including butane, and are trained in appropriate emergency actions required in response to a potential release. Employee training includes participation in internal response drills with government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the Fire Departmen"

      "SummaryText": "t. Employees are trained and must demonstrate an understanding of the required tasks before being allowed to supervise the unloading of butane railcars.  \n\n-    Safety Equipment: The facility has a release monitoring system to detect flammable vapors near the vapor combustor. This system will shut down the vapor combustor to prevent the ignition of vapors resulting from a spill or release. The butane unloading system is equipped with a detection and deluge system, an emergency stop system, and excess flow valves, which prevent the uncontrolled release of butane liquids or vapors while unloading.\n\n-    Facility Design: The butane handling facility has been designed to meet the standards set forth in NFPA 58 and is operated in compliance with the OSHA standard for the storage and handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (29 CFR 1910.110).\n\n\n\nIV. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe NuStar facility has an excellent record of accident prevention.  There have been no accidental release of regulated substances, meeting the RMP five-year accident history reporting criteria, in the past five years.\n\n\n\nV. Emergency Response Information\n\nThe NuStar facility has developed and implemented a written emergency action plan to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on factors such as modifications made to the plant process or changes in the communication procedures.\n\n\n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe NuStar facility will continue to improve employee training resources, conduct safety audits, and incident investigations, as applicable, to continuously improve worker and public safety. The facility will also continue to actively manage changes to facilities, process chemistry, process technology, and process equipment, as well as to review and revise operating, maintenance, emergency and communication procedures to ensure that they reflect current operating practices.
