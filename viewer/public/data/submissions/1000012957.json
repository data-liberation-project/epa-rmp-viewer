This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOur facility's primary activity is cylinder gas distribution and a retail welding supply store.  We have one regulated substance, chlorine, at our facility.  The maximum amount stored is 3,750 pounds which is in 150 pound cylinders.\n\nSince chlorine is not used at our facility and valves are never opened our accidental release prevention program centers around the proper and safe handling of cylinders.  Proper equipment is provided and training such as forklift operation is documented.\n\nThere has bee no accidental release during the previous five years.\n\nOxarc has a written emergency response plan to deal with the accidental release of hazardous materials.  The plan includes provisions for notification of neighbors and emergency response agencies, evacuation, first aid and medical treatment.  The plan is updated to reflect and pertinent changes taking place.\n\nNo changes are currently planned.  We continue to look for ways to reduce the quantity of chemicals on hand."
