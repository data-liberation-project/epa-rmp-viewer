MCP is committed to being a responsible member of the Martinez and greater Contra Costa County communities.  We place a high priority on operating our facility in a safe, healthful, and environmentally sound manner.\n\nShell requirements dictate that their facilities regularly identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials, evaluate risk, and reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of process design, engineering controls, and safe work practices and procedures.  This commitment to healthly, safe, secure, and environmentally sound operations is documented in the Shell HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and The Environment) Commitment and Policy.  The MCP Risk Management Program (RMP) is incorporated into this HSSE Commitment and Policy through the MCP Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Management System or HSSE-MS.  The MCP HSSE-MS conforms to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 requirements.  Specific Plant RMP issues are identified, evaluated, resourced, and checked via an internal action tracking tool.  These documents, as well as other related materials are readily available to all workers.\n\nMCP practically stresses safe, healthful, secure, and environmentally sound operations via an annual employee training program, monthly safety meetings, the Union-Management Health and Safety Committee and the Shell Training Awareness Recognition Team (START).   MCP has a Health, Safety, Security, And Environmental (HSSE) and Administrative Procedures Manual that comprehensively covers various aspects of management systems conformance.  Each employee and field contractor at MCP also receives a Basic HSSE Requirements Handbook.   Shell also maintains internal HSSE Audit and Management Review programs under its HSSE-MS.

Management reviews occur continually throughout the year and at least annually.\nA Description of The Martinez Catalyst Plant\nAnd The Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant consists of 2 main batch processes: Ethylene Oxide (EO) Catalyst and RM-17.  The EO Catalyst Process produces a silver-based catalyst that is sold to industrial customers that convert hydrocarbons to ethylene oxide.  A specially formulated impregnating solution is produced at the Plant and absorbed onto carrier pellets to make the EO Catalyst products. \n\nEthylenediamine (EDA), which is used in our EO Catalyst Process, is the only substance regulated by the RMP rule that is present above the EPA threshold quantity.  The total potential EDA inventory is 151,900 pounds.  Of this amount, 75,900 pounds could be present in a single tank.  The EO Catalyst Process is a Program 3 process for RMP rule compliance purposes.  \n\nAccidental Release Scenarios (Worst-Case And Alternative) For Ethylenediamine\n\nMCP has conducted offsite consequence analyses, using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines for both the worst-case scenario (WCS), and the alternate release scenarios (ARS).  The results of MCP's analysis is described below:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for EDA at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is the release of the total contents of the 10,000-gallon (approximately 75,950 pounds) liquid storage container (Tank 390 or 391).  This scenario represents the highly unlikely release of the largest quantity of material from the largest EDA storage tank.  Pure EDA (100%) is assumed.  Only the Tank Farm A containment dike is credited as a passive mitigation measure. The results from the RMP*Comp 1.07 is 528 feet.\n\nThe population impacted by this scenario includes the Union Pacific Laydown Yard, the National Tree And Garden Company Staging Facility, the Waters Moving property, and Demolition and E"

Please note that the RMP*Comp 1.07 results appear to be the lower detection limit for this tool.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nWell-documented offsite consequence analyses are essential to adequately communicate potential acute hazards at the Martinez Catalyst Plant (MCP). Offsite consequence analysis is also a tool used by MCP to assist the CCCHSD in emergency response planning.  To do this, MCP has developed Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) as required under the CalARP Rule.  ARS results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by a facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event.  These scenarios may be unlikely to occur, but are physically possible and reasonably feasible.\n\nThe ARS associated with the release of pure (100%) EDA at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is a 2 inch line being severed between the storage tank and the process unit.  This would result in a release of approximately 2800 pounds or 350 gallons of liquid EDA for at least 10 minutes.  Ten minutes was the time determined for the release to be detected, the system remotely isolated, and the pump shut down upon detection of the leak. This scenario was chosen through consultation with MCP Operations and Process Engineering. It is considered to be the worse credible scenario associated with the batch handling of EDA.  The results from RMP*Comp 1.07 is 528 feet.\n\nThe population impacted by this scenario includes the Union Pacific Laydown Yard, the National Tree And Garden Company Staging Facility, the Waters Moving property, and Demolition and Excavation Debris Box Services (all located on Bridgehead Road within the city limits of the City Of Martinez), part of the Tesoro AMORCO Wharf and possibly the Shell Martinez Refinery (SMR) properties.

Please note that the RMP*Comp 1.07 results appear to be the lower detection limit for this tool.\n\nAccidental Release Management System Program/Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nManagement System\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant has developed a formal Risk Management system based on CCPS Plant Guidelines for Technical Management of Chemical Process Safety and Shell HSSE-MS requirements.  This system is designed to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements.  This management system satisfies the requirements of Section 2735.6 of the CalARP regulation and ensures that the risk management program elements are developed and continually improved.  All records associated with the prevention program elements are retained for a minimum of five years unless otherwise specified in the CalARP regulation.  The management system activities are further discussed below.\n\nA?

Implementing - Each assigned OSHA PSM/CalARP focal point facilitates the implementation of their program element.\n\nA?    Controlling - Members of management and the individuals responsible for each risk management prevention program element periodically conduct internal reviews or audits against the goals and objectives of the element.  Annually, the procedures are reviewed and recertified to ensure that they remain accurate and reflect the current practices. \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe process safety prevention programs described in the following section represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.   Many of these prevention programs (e.g., process hazards analysis or PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigation) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (e.g., administrative and engineering controls).  Those recommendations that are planned for implementation at the Martinez Catalyst Plant will be discussed in the \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\" Section. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program For MCP\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nProcess safety information (PSI) development, dissemination, and use are vital to the effective operation of a stationary source.  MCP personnel use information regarding chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits in daily and strategic decision-making.  Accurate and complete information that is readily accessible to employees and field contractors is therefore a basic component of the OSHA PSM/CalARP prevention program.\n\nEstablished practices made sure that the original PSI was compiled in conjunction with the initial process hazard analyses (PHAs).

Personnel have access to PSI information on a 24-hour basis. Accurate PSI is maintained for the life of the facility.\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant has compiled process safety information (PSI) that satisfies the regulatory requirements of OSHA PSM and Section 2760.1 of the CalARP regulations.  This information was compiled under the direction of the MCP HSE Manager and specifically followed PSM/RMP PSI requirements.  Various technical resources (Process Engineer, Plant Engineer, Control Systems Engineer, Operations and Maintenance) made sure that the level of scope and the level of detail was appropriate to safe MCP operations.  This PSI enables personnel involved in the operation of the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances such as ethylenediamine (EDA). \n\nAppropriate personnel from the Martinez Catalyst Plant verify that the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  They also verify that all equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested, and operated in a safe manner.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nBy systematically examining and identifying process safety hazards associated with the operation of a covered process, the Martinez Catalyst Plant has been able to plan and take appropriate action to improve the safety of our workers, the community, and the environment.

These requirements are contained in the fire prevention and suppression procedure and hot work permit, Title 8 California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR) A?4848 and A?6777 respectively. \n\nThe Operations department authorizes maintenance and other work in their area and issues hot work permits for all grinding, burning, welding, and brazing performed on or near covered processes.  The hot work permit is terminated when continued use of the ignition source is hazardous, when conditions of its issuance change, or when the permitted hot work has been inactive for more than 2 hours (unless tests show that conditions are still non-hazardous). \n\nTwo copies of the hot work permit are maintained.  The first is available at the physical location of the hot work for the duration of the work.  The second is provided to the Operations Department where it is kept on file for a"

Any special precautions or limitations to be observed before, during, or after the use of the source of ignition, including the need for a fire watch and fire hoses or extinguishers.  The criteria for needing a fire watch and the responsibilities of the fire watch are identified in the fire prevention and suppression procedure.\n\nSafety (including hot work) permits are issued at the job site.  The issuer of the permit performs an inspection of the area to ensure the following prior to authorization of the hot work permit:\n\nA?    The source of ignition may be safely used A? The fire prevention and suppression procedure requires that only approved apparatus be used and that personnel performing the hot work (including contractors) be informed of the hazards and properly trained.  Also, the flammable gas or vapor content in the air must be less than 1% of the lowest content that is flammable or explosive; \n    \nA?    Combustible materials (including oil accumulations) in areas that will be exposed during hot work are protected or relocated;\n    \nA?    Proper fire extinguishing equipment is available to employees performing the hot work.\n\nPersonnel in the immediate work area are notified prior to initiation of the hot work to make them aware of the ignition source.  This awareness allows applicable personnel to quickly contact the fire watch and personnel performing hot work when continued use of the source of ignition becomes hazardous.

Field contractors who have completed MCP-specific training are annually provided with an identification sticker for their hard hats.\n\nThe HSSE Department reviews selected contractor owners at least annually.  The frequency of these reviews is adjusted according to safety performance and service provided.  The HSE Department ensures that proper training is provided and documentation maintained for each contractor.  The HSSE Department also monitors contractor performance (e.g., compliance with stationary source safe work practices, knowledge of types of work and the hazards involved).  Documentation of the audits and on site evaluations is maintained for a minimum of five years.   The Contractor employer maintains contractor training documentation.\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Martinez Catalyst Plant has compiled a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The compilation of this information satisfies the requirements of Section 2750.9 of the CalARP regulation.  The five-year accident history allows MCP to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the onsite and offsite impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that this accidental release will not occur again.   The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against reoccurrence.  \n\nDuring the 2009 PHA and as part of this RMP/Cal-ARP updated (6/2009), certain incident investigation reports from January 1999 to present to ident"

No accidental releases of EPA or Cal-ARP regulated substances (e.g., EDA) were identified.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nOverall safety at the Martinez Catalyst Plant is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases.  MCP has therefore implemented an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases on employees, the public, and the environment.  MCPA?s emergency response program is covered under contract with the broader emergency action plan/emergency response plan (EAP/ERP) administered by the Shell Martinez Refinery (SMR).  The SMR EAP/ERP provides a complete range of emergency response services to MCP including a full incident command system, the Auxiliary Fire Crew, a Hazardous Materials Team, a Confined Space Rescue Team, and an Emergency Medical Team (EMT).

This EAP/ERP also includes a notification list that provides the telephone numbers of agencies and individuals to contact in the event of one of several pre-identified emergencies (e.g., fire, employee injury, and employee fatality).  The agencies and individuals represent local emergency responders (e.g., Fire Department), public notification and regulatory reporting requirements (e.g., CCCHSD), and internal notification (e.g., Site Manager, Corporate Headquarters).  The notification list requires that designated personnel make the notifications and document when the telephone calls were placed and the name and position of the person contacted. Completed A?Notification MatricesA? are maintained for five years.     \n\nMCP uses basic fire fighting equipment such as fire extinguishers, hose reels, and fire monitors, as itA?s chemical-specific mitigation equipment at the MCP Site.  Various personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical-resistant clothing, fire bunker gear, SCBAs, other respiratory protection, etc.) are also readily available.

Recommendations may be developed as a result of these studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and evaluated for risk.  Action items are then assigned and resourced to implement each recommendation.  Communication of these action items or planned activities informs workers, the public, and other stakeholders of measurable improvements for safety that are being incorporated at MCP.\n\nPersonnel reviewed the following technical information to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident which could have reasonably resulted in an offsite consequence (i.e., exceeding the EPA End Point for ethylenediamine):\n\nA?    2009 EO Catalyst PHA (HAZOP);\nA?    2009 Seismic Update (Walkdown) for the EO Catalyst Process (EDA Handling Systems);\nA?    2008 Security Vulnerability Analysis (SVA)"
