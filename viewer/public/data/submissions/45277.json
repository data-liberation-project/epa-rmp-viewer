      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) updates the 2004 RMP for the Heber Geothermal Company facility, now Heber 1, and the Second Imperial Geothermal Company facility, now Heber 2.  Both facilities are operated by Ormat-Nevada, Inc. and located in Heber, California.  The 2006 update addresses the modifications being made to Heber 1 and Heber 2 (known as G-1 and G-2), including the addition of processes containing reportable quantities of isopentane at Heber 1 and an increase in the quantity of isopentane used at Heber 2.  The 2006 update also includes additional quantities of chlorine used at both sites.\nBoth Heber facilities each have processes that contain chlorine in amounts greater of than the threshold quantities listed for this toxic substance in Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act and established under Article 2, Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code. Both Heber facilities also have processes that contain greater amounts of isopentane than the state and federal threshold planning quantities established under these codes for this flammable substance. The chlorine and isopentane processes at Heber 1 and Heber 2 are subject to the Program 3 requirements for the RMP.\n\nThe updated RMP meets the requirements of the federal Risk Management Program contained in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program contained in Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations. The quantities of the two regulated substances handled at the facilities also exceed the threshold quantities in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) process safety management regulations in 29 CFR 1910.119 and require hazard assessment under that program.\n\nBoth Heber 1 and Heber 2 use chlorine for the control of microbiological growth in the cooling towers. At the existing and new processes, the chlorine is delivered in Department of Transportation (DOT)-appr"

The RMP describes the processes and equipment used to handle the delivery, storage, monitoring, detection, and injection of chlorine into the circulating water at both these facilities. The plan provides details on the changes to these systems that have been implemented at these facilities in the past five years and includes the plans for additional safety measures in the event of an accidental rupture of flexible lines, a failure of the leak detection equipment, or a fire in the cooling tower areas.\n\nHeber 1 and Heber 2 use isopentane as the working fluid in the Rankin cycles for its Ormat Energy Converter Units.  The isopentane is delivered by qualified suppliers, stored in a secure area designed for seismic loads, pumped to the individual units, and circulated and recovered through a closed-loop system. The plants have leak detection monitors and fire protection equipment installed through the area. The RMP describes the current methods of delivery, storage, transfer, use, and recovery of this flammable substance at the geothermal facilities and includes a description of the vapor recovery and evacuation units installed at Heber 1 and Heber 2. The RMP includes additional safety measures to reduce the risk of damage from release of this flammable substance.  The RMP includes the specifications for the safe handling of both regulated substances and describes the training programs for employees, operators, emergency responders, and contractors on site. It summarizes the inspection and preventive maintenance programs for the chlorine and isopentane delivery, storage, and chlorination systems and describes the incident investigations, compliance audits, management of change procedures, and pre-startup reviews for these regulated substances.\n\nWith the implementation of these procedures and safety equipment, there have been no report"

No releases of chlorine or isopentane at the facilities have resulted in death, injury, or substantial damage to onsite facilities nor have any releases of chlorine or isopentane caused offsite evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. has an Emergency Response Plan in place that provides for the notification of the public, evacuation of the sites, and procedures to be undertaken in the event of an accidental release of chlorine or isopentane at these facilities.\n\nOrmat-Nevada, Inc. is submitting this RMP to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the Administrating Agency for the CalARP Program."
