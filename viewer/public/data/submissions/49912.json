The facility is for chlorine use for disinfection of the reclaimed water from Cole Creek Reservoir Tank and Joaquin Ranch Offsite Storage Pond.  The Cole Creek Chlorine Facility is situated in the middle of a site that includes the Cole Creek Reservoir Tank, Joaquin Ranch Offsite Storage Pond, Cole Creek Pump Station and Cole Creek No. 2 Pump Station.  \n\nThe chlorine is housed outside under a roof and is surrounded by a chain link fence that extends up to the roof.  There are brown slats inserted in the fence to limit visibility into the Cole Creek Chlorine Facility.  A windsock is mounted on the roof.\n\nThe chlorine system includes two (2) @ 1-ton chlorine cylinders stored in ChlorTainer\u00ae vessels.  During normal operations, chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders and the gaseous chlorine is fed by chlorinators to injectors which mix chlorine with water to form a chlorine solution.  An automatic switchover device provides the ability for continuous chlorine feeding when one cylinder is empty.  \n\nThe two chlorinators route the chlorine to the Cole Creek Pump Station and the Cole Creek No. 2 Pump Station.  At the pump stations, the injector systems are installed to mix the gaseous chlorine with feed water and inject the chlorine solution into the pump station discharge pipelines.  Each injector systems include an ejector, multistage centrifugal pump, pressure gage and appropriate valves.\n\nThe ChlorTainer\u00ae vessels are able to contain releases of chlorine to minimize the worst case release scenario during normal operations.\n\nChemicals Subject To USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\n\nRCWD uses chlorine at the Cole Creek Chlorine Facility in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA RMP and CalARP.

The threshold quantity under PSM for chlorine is 1,500 pounds.\n\nAccidental Releases During Past Five Years\n\nThe RCWD Cole Creek Chlorine Facility has not had any releases of chlorine during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nRCWD\u00bfs RMP programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n\n\u00bf Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems, and dechlorination systems, to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\u00bf Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.
