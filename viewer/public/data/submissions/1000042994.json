      "SummaryText": "Givaudan Flavors Corporation (GFC) operates a manufacturing facility in Cincinnati (Carthage), Ohio to produce a wide variety of flavor and flavor ingredients for food and beverage products.\r\n\r\nThe only process subject to the U.S. EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule is the storage of acetalehyde (flammable chemical) stored in a freezer located within a warehouse (Building 21) at the site. The worst case release as required by the RMP rule is the total loss of the single largest vessel (55 gallon drum) stored in the freezer, and a resultant vapor cloud  explosion. There are no public or environmental receptors within the flammables endpoint, which is completely on site. The effect of building mitigation includes the reduction in the flammables endpoint distance resulting  from the freezer being nested within a warehouse to the north and a refrigerated room/ warehouse to the west. Additional passive structures outside the freezer include two trailers to the south, and buildings 20,23 and a number of smaller structures to the west.  In addition, a 20 feet high earthen berm runs across the entire western length of the site and would prevent shock waves and debris from reaching residential housing to the west of the site. Pursuant to the April 9, 2004 revisions (69 FR 18819) to Section 68.155(c) of the RMP rule, quantitative release amounts related to the off-site consequence analysis of the worst release scenario are included in the individual elements of the RMP Plan.\r\n\r\nA review of the accident history for the acetaldehyde storage area reveals that there have been no releases with off-site impacts within the past 5 years (or since the site began operation). GFC has also co-ordinated its emergency response procedures with the local Carthage Fire Department. Therefore, GFC qualifies as a Program 1 facility under the RMP rule. Accordingly, no alternate release scenarios are required nor were they prepared.\r\n\r\nGFC has maintained a management / employee safety committee at"
