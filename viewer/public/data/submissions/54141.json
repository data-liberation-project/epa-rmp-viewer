Sara Lee's operations include the manufacturing of frozen bakery products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand names such as Sara Lee. Sara Lee Bakery has been in operation at this facility for over 40 years providing quality bakery products and over 600 jobs to the local community.\n\nLike most food manufacturing facilties, we use anhydrous\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nSara Lee Bakery is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration systems \nobey our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP program includes\nelements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\ncomprehensive program of i"
