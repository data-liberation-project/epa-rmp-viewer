If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Superior Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We also maintain incipient stage fire fighting equipment on site.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: \nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail propane dealers.  The facility consists of five 30,000-gallon tanks.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one of the 30,000-gallon storage tanks or the connecting piping when each of the storage tanks are filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in the 3-inch diameter pipe from the railcar unloading tower, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history: \nKeyera Energy, Inc. acquired the facility in June 2007.  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place.  To the best of our knowledge no such incident occurred prior to acquisition by Keyera Energy, Inc.\n\nThe "

Periodic process safety inspections will be conducted followed with timely response."
