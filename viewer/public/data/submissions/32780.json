Disinfection involves addition of chlorine and aqueous ammonia to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may cause harm to public health.  Other chemicals are handled and safely used onsite to aid filtering and removal of organics and other particulate materials that may affect the taste and odor of the treated water.  These chemicals are not part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program, but are handled, stored, and used in a safe manner by Randall-Bold WTP staff.  \n\nThe chlorine disinfection process at the Randall-Bold WTP is subject to two regulations - the Federal Risk Management Plan and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), which is California's version of the RMP.  The initial compliance deadline for both of these regulations was June 21, 1999.  As required by the regulations, an RMP was prepared for the Randall-Bold WTP and submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD) at that time.  The RMP was then revised and resubmitted to address CCCHSD comments in March 2000. The RMP is now being resubmitted to comply with 5-year resubmission RMP/CalARP requirements.  \n\nPrior to RMP/CalARP requirements, the Randall-Bold WTP implemented programs to comply with several other accidental release prevention regulations that predated RMP/CalARP.  These earlier regulations included California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and California's Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) because of use and storage of chlorine. The California RMPP law was repealed in January 1997 and replaced by the CalARP regulation.\n\nThe goal of these regulations and programs (existing and"

To meet this goal, CCWD has identified potential hazards, implemented comprehensive accident prevention programs, installed safety and release response equipment (including a scrubber system to treat release events and other process and piping related safety equipment), and prepared for emergencies. The CCWD's approach to meet safety information and associated operating and maintenance procedures and documentation requirements for RMP/CalARP is to build upon the existing programs and regulatory compliance activities associated with the PSM and RMPP Programs. The PSM and RMPP were implemented at Randall-Bold WTP when regulations became effective at the facility.  Most of the compliance requirements, documentation, procedures, and safety programs to meet compliance with these new regulations were taken directly from PSM and RMPP documents or existing operating and maintenance procedures. \n\nIt should be noted that this RMP is specific to the chlorine process at Randall-Bold WTP.  Randall-Bold WTP aqueous ammonia is below the Federal RMP threshold concentration limit of 20 percent by weight.  However, there is no aqueous ammonia threshold concentration limit for the State of California.  As such, all aqueous ammonia use in California exceeds the State's threshold concentration limit and may be subject to RMP requirements depending on storage amount.  Aqueous ammonia use at Randall-Bold WTP is presented in an addendum RMP under agreement with CCCHSD.\n\nChlorine Safety Policy\n\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  We at the Randall-Bold WTP use chlorine to disinfect our water.  Storing large qualities of chlorine can be a hazard.

Up to eight more 1-ton containers are kept in the chlorine storage room. A vacuum is used to draw chlorine out of the containers and into the water supply.  \n\nThe chlorine storage and use areas are all inside a building that is designed to vent to a scrubber in the event of a chlorine release. The scrubber system can remove up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas released inside the building. The areas where chlorine is stored or used are equipped with chlorine sensors that alarm in the event of a chlorine leak. The Randall-Bold WTP is operated and maintained 24-hours a day by highly trained and experienced staff who are experts in the safe handling of chlorine and are prepared to respond to any release situation. Plant access is controlled so that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the chlorine building. Trained plant staff must accompany visitors.\n\nPotential for Releases with Offsite Consequences\n\nCCWD evaluated two scenarios that might lead to releases. The worst case scenario is specified by the EPA and consists of releasing the entire contents of one of the chlorine containers over a 10-minute period. This scenario is extremely unlikely, resulting only from catastrophic events such as an airplane crash. This scenario assumes that the incident occurs after the containers have been delivered and are in the chlorine storage building because containers are not stored outside. An EPA-developed air dispersion model called RMP*Comp was used to estimate the distance to a point at which the released chlorine gas would no longer present a significant public health impact. The calculated distance for the worst case scenario was 2.2 miles based on indoor chlorine use and storage.

This concentration is a set value in RMP*CompTM.  It slightly overestimates the actual concentration to yield conservative results.\n\nGiven the aqueous ammonia toxic endpoint (TE) of 0.14 milligrams per liter (CalARP Section 2770.5), the WCS distance to TE is 0.5 miles.  Using census data from LandView\u00bf6, the estimated population within the WCS circle is 1,000.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe ARS for Randall-Bold WTP is a 1-inch diameter hole near the bottom of the aqueous ammonia storage tank (7.5 feet from top of tank).  The ARS assumes that it will take outside responders approximately 90 minutes to repair the leak.  The ARS also assumes that the spill will cover the entire surface area of the chemical storage area and spill containment basin during the 90 minutes period.  Using RMP*CompTM, the estimated release rate is 331 pounds per minute (about 41.4 gallons per minute).\n\nDefault values found in RMP*CompTM (e.g., stability class D, and wind speed 3 meters per second) were used to calculate the ARS distance to TE.  Additionally, the ARS assumed a 20 percent aqueous ammonia concentration to utilize data readily available in RMP*CompTM.\n\nGiven the aqueous ammonia TE of 0.14 milligrams per liter (CalARP Section 2770.5), the ARS distance to TE is 0.2 miles.

This scenario is less improbable than the worst-case release scenario. It takes into account that Randall-Bold WTP's extensive safety and release prevention systems will help to mitigate the impacts of such a release. The relatively small quantity of chlorine gas that is estimated would be released through this hole would be prevented from leaving the building by the scrubber system.

Disinfection involves the addition of chlorine and aqueous ammonia to the water to destroy bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may cause harm to the public health. Chemicals such as alum, ozone, and polymers are added to aid in the filtering and removal of organics and other particulate matter that may affect the taste and odor of the potable water. Chlorine and aqueous ammonia are the only CalARP regulated substances in use at Randall-Bold WTP.\n\nDescription of the Process\n\nAqueous ammonia, at 19% concentration by weight, is stored in a 6,000 gallons capacity aboveground storage tank (tank).  The tank is located in a concrete walled chemical storage area.  The chemical storage area gradually slopes to a secondary containment basin.  This slope and drainage serve to collect and contain liquid spills from the tank.\n\nFor operational purposes, the storage volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The tank is equipped with various devices to relieve vacuum and prevent over pressurization, and control emissions during bulk loading and operation.  These devices include a pressure vacuum relief valve, vapor scrubber, and vapor return line.  In the event of excess pressure, ammonia vapors from the tank vent through the pressure relief valve to the vapor scrubber.  During bulk loading, vapors are returned to the delivery tanker truck by way of a vapor return line.\n\nThe primary use and purpose of aqueous ammonia is to form chloramines to maintain chlorine residual.  Chloramines prevent the formation of trihalomethanes in the treated water distribution system.  To form these chloramines, the chemical feed room pumps draw aqueous ammonia from the bulk storage tank.  From the chemical feed room, aqueous ammonia is piped to an injector.  The injector feeds the a"

The chlorine solution is added after the post ozone contactor, to convert the free chlorine residual to combined chlorine residual (i.e., chloramines).\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nCalARP requires an offsite consequence analysis of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS).  The purpose of the offsite consequence analysis is to identify and communicate the potential hazards at the stationary source.\n\nThe Randall-Bold WTP offsite consequence analysis was conducted in accordance with the EPA document, RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines (guidelines).  An EPA approved dispersion model (RMP*CompTM) was used to evaluate the WCS and ARS.   RMP*CompTM is readily available to the public through EPA.\n\nFollowing are the results of the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nUnder the guidelines, a WCS considers a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the single largest container over a ten-minute period.  Given these parameters, the single largest container at Randall-Bold WTP is the aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The tank has a maximum capacity of 6,000 gallons.  By CCWD administrative procedure the tank volume never exceeds 5,400 gallons.\n\nFor the Randall-Bold WTP WCS, the model input used passive mitigation.  This mitigation consisted of the containment of a spill in both the chemical storage area (area) and spill containment basin (basin).  For modeling purposes it was assumed that both the area and basin flooded simultaneously.  The depth of the modeled basin was set at the maximum height of the basin.  These are extremely conservative assumptions as they present the maximum amount of spill surface area exposure.\n\nThe model input also consisted of conservative input (e.g., rural conditions, stability class F, and wind speed"

These safeguards were implemented to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of aqueous ammonia.  Some of these safeguards, which were identified during the CCHSD audit (September 2001), have been implemented.\n\nPrevention Program Elements\n\nThe prevention program identifies basic elements that are the foundation of sound prevention practices.  Under CalARP Program 2 requirements, there are seven elements in the prevention program.  These elements and CCWD compliance with these respective elements are presented below.\n\nSafety Information\n\nDevelopment, dissemination, and use of safety information are vital to the effective operation of the Randall-Bold WTP.  CCWD personnel use information regarding the chemical hazards, equipment specifications, and operating limits on a daily basis and in all strategic decision-making processes.  Accurate and complete information readily available to all personnel is therefore a basic component of the RMP.  This information directly benefits the release prevention program as it provides CCWD personnel with the tools to safely operate process equipment and, as a result, prevent an accidental release.\n\nSafety information may need to be developed and/or revised, and distributed in the event of certain process modifications as described in Section 2745.11(a) of the CalARP regulations.  If the proposed modification is subject to this section, then specific measures will be taken to ensure that the appropriate persons/parties are consulted and/or notified, and measures are in place to ensure safe process start-up.  \n\nFor CCWD consultation and notification purposes, proposed modifications affecting the aqueous ammonia process are subject to the procedures found in Section 12, \"Management of Change (MOC)\", of the CCWD Process Safety Management.

This safety information will be maintained for the life of the process.\n\nHazard Review\n\nCCWD has been able to plan and take appropriate action to improve the safety of Randall-Bold WTP employees, the community, and the environment by systematically examining each process and identifying hazards associated with the operation of the aqueous ammonia process.  CCWD performed a Hazard Review of the aqueous ammonia process in May 2003 to:\n\n\u00faIdentify hazards and credible human errors and/or equipment failures that could lead to an accidental release of aqueous ammonia; \n\u00faEvaluate the likelihood and/or consequence of various release scenarios; determine if existing aqueous ammonia chemical-specific prevention steps and controls are adequate; and,\n\u00faWhere existing controls were deemed inadequate, identify additional steps to control the hazard.\n\nThe Hazard Review participants consisted of Senior and/or Supervising CCWD personnel from Operations, Maintenance, Safety, General Management, and Process Engineering.

Certification of SVA completion was submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in March 2003. \n\nIn accordance with Section 2755.2 of the CalARP regulations, CCWD consulted with CCHSD on the use of this methodology.  The Hazard Review was completed in May 2003.\n\nCalARP requires that the Hazard Review be updated at least once every five years, or whenever a major process change occurs.  CCWD will update the Hazard Review by May 2008, or sooner if a major process change occurs accordingly.  If a major aqueous ammonia process change occurs, all hazards identified in the hazard review will be resolved before startup of the changed aqueous ammonia process as required by the CalARP regulations.\n\nA formal seismic assessment was conducted in June 2003. It was prepared in accordance with the \"Guidance for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Seismic Assessments\" document, and included the necessary site visit and review of documents, such as a previously prepared seismic report from 1996.

There were components, as identified in the 1996 seismic report, that were listed moderate to low in retrofit priority.  These 1996 findings were based on 1995 Uniform Building Code and the more stringent CCWD seismic criteria.  Given the moderate to low priority, retrofit construction was not conducted.  However, none of these components are directly associated with the aqueous ammonia process.\n\nTo ensure structural component integrity, visual inspections of Randall-Bold WTP are conducted as part of a Plant Operator's daily walk through inspection.  The inspection includes the reporting and noting of structural components for failure or potential failure.  Any structural component failure or potential failure that might be observed during these inspections would be noted in the plant logbook, and reported to Maintenance for the appropriate follow-up and/or repairs.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nStandard operating procedures that are clearly written and current and safe work practices can ensure that both experienced and inexperienced employees operate the process and respond to emergencies in a safe, consistent, and prescribed manner. Such procedures benefit the release prevention program by providing operating personnel with clear and concise guidance to prevent and/or respond to an accidental release.
