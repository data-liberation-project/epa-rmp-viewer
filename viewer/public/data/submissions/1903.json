      "SummaryText": "    The Bozeman Wastewater Treatment Plant has, at this time, a regulated substance -- CHLORINE.  The plant would have anywhere between a minimum of 2000 pounds and a maximum of 8000 pounds of this substance at any given time.  Because of this, the facility has a Risk Management Plan.  This plan is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO).\n\n    The facility has a community response plan, has its own emergency response plan and has specific actions to be taken if the regulated substance, chlorine, were to ever be accidentally released.  Within this plan, local agencies that should be contacted are listed, as well as information on training the facility's employees and local agencies responding on how to administer emergency health care and what actions and precautions must be considered.\n\n    We have had no accidental releases of chlorine and no reportable accidents since the construction of the plant in 1970.  These prior \"achievements\" will only be fortified with extra security measures in future plans of the plant.  To improve safety, we plan to install an emergency shut off system which would halt all flow from valves of our one ton chlorine tanks.  If an accident were to occur, this system could be quickly shut down to prevent exposure to employees and the surrounding community.  Another plan of action is a possible switch over to sodium hypochlorite (liquid bleach) or calcium hypochlorite tablets which would eliminate potential hazardous gas leaks."
