We are committed to\noperating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and\nresponsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we\ninvest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the American\nChemistry Council (ACC), we adhere to the principles of\nResponsible Care and are working towards RC 14001\ncertification.  In addition to ensuring that our employees\nhave the best possible training in the operation of our\nprocesses, we demand that safety be the first priority in\nthe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our\nprocesses.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection\nprograms that ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to\nimplement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\nreleases of regulated substances.  Examples of controls to\nprevent releases include (1) installation of pressure relief\nvalves to prevent rupture of vessels due to\noverpressurization, (2) routine visual inspection and\nthickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good\ncondition, (3) using materials of construction that are\ncompatible with the process chemistry, (4) vessel pressure\nand temperature are continuously monitored and (5) use of\ncarbon scrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n\nMitigation measures that have been included in our design\ninclude installation of isolation valves, fire suppression\nsystems in areas where flammable chemicals are present and\nfire fighting equipment in all process areas, a fully\nimplemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an\nalarm system for early notification of a release.  Since\nthis is a small site, our employees have only been trained\nto handle fires in the incipient stages and small spills.\nWe would rely on the local fire department and hazmat team\nfor major spills requiring sui"

The site is completely fenced and\nthe gate kept closed except for controlled entry.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Kemira Chemicals, Inc. - Shreveport Plant is primarily\ninvolved in manufacturing polymers for the paper industry.\nAs a part of the manufacturing process, we use one substance\nthat is covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule,\n40 CFR 68.  This process is subject to Program Level 3.  The\nplant itself is located on 5.32 acres in an Industrial Park\nwith few neighbors.  The plant also uses a combination of\ngood design practices, an accidental release prevention\nprogram, and an emergency response program to ensure the\nsafety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We\nare committed to operating our facility in a safe and\nresponsible manner.\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that companies provide\ninformation about two types of offsite consequence analysis\nscenarios: worst-case scenarios and alternative release\nscenarios.  There are strict requirements for choosing and\nmodeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these\nscenarios are often exceedingly conservative and represent a\nsituation that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the\nalternative release scenarios is to provide emergency\nplanners with more information about the chemicals we handle\nand their relative hazards.  The alternative release\nscenarios are more realistic than the worst case scenarios\nand could possibly occur.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-\nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing\naccidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management\nsystem addresses each of the key features of a successful\nprevention program, as described below:\n\n     PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Kemira Chemicals, Inc. - Shreveport Plant maintains a\nvariety of technical "

This information typically\nincludes (1) toxicity information, (2) physical data, (3)\nreactivity and corrosivity data, (4) thermal and chemical\nstability data and (5) hazards of mixing substances\ntogether.  MSDSs are available to all employees as well as\nthe emergency responders in our community.  MSDSs for all\nShreveport chemicals are maintained on site.\n\nImportant process parameters are also documented and\nmaintained.

The results and findings from these revalidation\nstudies are documented and retained, and recommendations are\ntracked by management until completed.\n\n     OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators and supervisors work together to\ndevelop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the\nsafe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all\nmodes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal\noperations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency\nshutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a\nnew or improved process.  Operating procedures are used as a\nreference by experienced employees and provide a consistent\nbasis for training new employees.

We have implemented maintenance and inspection\n\nprograms that ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to\n\nimplement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of regulated substances.  Examples of controls to\n\nprevent releases include (1) installation of pressure relief\n\nvalves to prevent rupture of vessels due to\n\noverpressurization, (2) routine visual inspection and\n\nthickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good\n\ncondition, (3) using materials of construction that are\n\ncompatible with the process chemistry, (4) vessel pressure\n\nand temperature are continuously monitored and (5) use of\n\ncarbon scrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\n\n\n\nMitigation measures that have been included in our design\n\ninclude installation of isolation valves, fire suppression\n\nsystems in areas where flammable chemicals are present and\n\nfire fighting equipment in all process areas, a fully\n\nimplemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an\n\nalarm system for early notification of a release.
