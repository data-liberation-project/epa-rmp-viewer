Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Mobil Pipe Line Company (Mobil) at its Baden Terminal west of Stanton, TX monitors and maintains an underground storage facility.  There are four active storage caverns under the terminal.  Gas is taken from a pipeline during non-peak periods and placed in the storage caverns, then returned to the pipeline as needed.  The facility also contains equipment to add natural gas liquids (NGL) from outside sources into the underground storage cavern.  NGL is a flammable mixture subject to RMP.  The facility utilizes certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  These safety precautions include: \n\n* Effectively managing our process operations;\n* Investing in the latest process safety technologies;\n* Training our personnel on an ongoing basis;\n* Reviewing our processes for hazards on a continuous basis; and\n* Ensuring safety is considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance.\n\nThe Baden Terminal maintains a policy to be a good business partner and a safe and conscientious neighbor who will operate its facility in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nMobil has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by our history of support and commitment to the community and our high environmental standards.\n\nWe are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continually strive to be the best in our industry.\n\n2.  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Baden Terminal contains the flammable mixture (NGL).\n\n3.  Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe RMP rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case "

      "SummaryText": "scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industry to develop a more realistic planning scenario.\n\nThe WCS and ARS for flammable chemicals at the Baden Terminal is the release of NGL.  The offsite impact is mitigated by our prevention programs listed in section one above. \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nMobil has developed an Environmental, Health & Safety Management System (EHSMS). Our EHSMS delineates the responsibilities of each team member and will help prevent major incidents and protect human health and the environment. \n\nOur operations supervisor has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  The operations supervisor ensures that safe work practices, equipment design specifications, and maintenance schedules adequately reduce the probability of harm that could be suffered by the operators or the public.\n\nThe Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) advisor provides support for hazard analysis activities and identification of EHS hazards and potential consequences.\n\nMobil has developed programs to comply with industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards. \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases.  Our process management systems address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Safety information,\n- Maintenance,\n- Hazard review,\n- Compliance audits,\n- Operating procedures,\n- Incident investigation, and\n- Training.\n\nOur risk management program uses these individual elements to prevent accidental NGL releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry leading management programs, we have designed systems and equipment to control, prevent, detect, and mitigate potential accidental releases. \n\nWe employ mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety syste"

Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.\n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Baden Terminal has had no accidents that meet the criteria for the Five-year Accident History. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nMobil has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  We maintain an \"open door\" policy and conduct emergency drills annually with local emergency response organizations to help ensure maximum understanding and cooperation during an emergency.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMobil continually strives to improve its safety programs to protect our employees and the public.  Our EHSMS requires us to establish annual measurable environmental, health, and safety objectives and use them to drive continuous improvement."
