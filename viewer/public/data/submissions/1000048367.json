Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in either 1,000 gallon or 1,500 gallon nurse tanks.  The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  This facility maintains approximately 28 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 32 1,500 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 355,600 pounds.

Our ammonia systems is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails.  All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\r\n\r\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventative maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.
