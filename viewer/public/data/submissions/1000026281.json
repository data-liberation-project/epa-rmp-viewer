In the scenario, we lose the total charge from our system; 14,500 pounds, in ten minutes, with no mitigation; and the distance to toxic end point being two miles, with Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour), Stability Class: F, Air Temperature: 77 degrees, and the topography is rural.\r\n\r\nOur alternate scenario is a broken valve on the discharge line of a compressor. The only mitigation used in this scenario is that it's in an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air, where we lose 1,620 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes, with 89.1 pounds a minute escaping to the outside air, with a toxic end point of 0.2 miles. Again, weather conditions are Wind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour), Stability Class: F, Air Temperature: 77 degrees and the topography is rural.\r\n\r\nWe have a plan in place that will improve the safety and performance of our refrigeration system and lower our ammonia inventory. Ocean Beauty Seafoods-Excursion Inlet Facility has historically taken the extra steps to ensure that the employees of our plant are provided a safe and comfortable working environment. We pride ourselves in the policies we have in place, and that we actively use on a daily basis to protect our employees, neighbors, and this beautiful environment surrounding our facility. The management along with our employees continually strive to improve our policies, and to maintain the highest standards."

We take great pride in protecting our employees, neighbors, environment, and seafood products sold to consumers around the world. Excursion Inlet is completely remote, unconnected by road, power grid, or water system. Boat, barge, and plane, are the only modes of access to the facility.\r\nLocated 40 miles west of Juneau at 58.25000 latitude and -135.263000 longitude, bordering on Glacier Bay National Park; the current site has been home to a salmon cannery, and coexisted alongside this diverse environment, and the wildlife that lives here, since 1908.\r\n\r\nHere at XIP; we process seafood from June to September every year, and use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system with a total of 18,000 pounds on site; Approximately 14,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is in our main refrigeration system ,with another 3,500 pounds being contained on-site in a separate system.\r\n\r\nWe have in place, an emergency response plan with annual training, which includes ammonia safety awareness for all employees, evacuation drills, and training for all response team members. We also employ a full time nurse who is EMT certified. We are compliant with OSHA's PSM, EPA's RMP, & other federal/state rules and regulations. There have been no reportable ammonia releases in the past five years. In fact; thanks to our preventive maintenance policies, there have not been any during the past ten years.\r\nWe have a leak detection system in place for early warning, which can shut off our compressor room remotely. There are exhaust fans on-site, and we have testing procedures in place as part of our PM program. Our safety pressure relief valves are plumbed to discharge to the outside of the building should over pressurization o"
