The facility's focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations. The goal of the Phillips 66 Glenpool Terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in its health, environmental and safety performance. In addition, Phillips 66 will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety and security of the Phillips 66 Glenpool Terminal and surrounding community. Since the initial startup one PHAs revalidation have been conducted to improved process safety using LOPA for assessing high consequence scenarios. In 2022, a new IPL was added to the covered process to prevent loss a primary containment due to pump seal failures."

Due to that fact, the accident prevention and risk management plan is organized to be consistent with the PSM regulation requirements.

As part of the ongoing PSM Program, the facility documents and tracks all incidents and near misses that occur within the facility. This incident database serves as the basis for the five-year accident history. \nRMP requires facilities to report any incident from a covered process involving a regulated substance and resulting in any of the following:\n\u2022\tOnsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage \n\u2022\tOffsite deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or environmental damage\nThe covered process/stationary source started operations in September 2018. Since the initial startup no accidents, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42, have occurred. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe Phillips 66 Glenpool Terminal Facility Response Plan provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.

Due to the nature of covered substance (butane), OCA focused on potential releases of flammable materials. In modeling flammable materials, the stationary source is required to present distances to endpoints resulting from any of the following: \n\u2022\tExplosion: Overpressure of 1 Psi. \n\u2022\tRadiant Heat/Fire: Radiant heat of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds. \n\u2022\tLower Flammability Limit: a lower flammability limit as provided in NFPA documents or other generally recognized sources. \nThe facility has submitted to the EPA a worst case and alternative release scenario for the regulated substance held in the covered process. The facility has modeled alternative release scenarios (ARSs) to show release scenarios that may have a more realistic chance of occurrence. Even the ARSs are rare events. The details of the process release conditions assumed for the hazard scenarios and assumptions made are provided in the Worst and Alternative Case Release Scenarios sections of the 2023 RMP Resubmission. \nSince no changes in inventory of the regulated substance or the operating conditions of the covered process have occurred in the last 5 years, the facility revalidated the Worst-Case and Alternate Scenarios that were modeled for the 2018 submission.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS \nPhillips 66's accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the facility's regulated substance to employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.
