(Ripon Energy) owns and operates an electricity generation facility (facility) at 944 South Stockton Ave., Ripon, California in San Joaquin County, California, in an area of primarily light industrial use.\n\n\n\nThe facility has one chemical in one process (Covered Process) as defined in the regulations that is regulated under the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) (Title 19, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Chapter 4.5).  \n\n\n\nRipon Energy's Covered Process is the Ammonia System, which uses Refrigeration Grade (99+ %) anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664 41 7) (1) as the refrigerant in an Ammonia Refrigeration System, also known as a Gas Turbine Inlet Air Chiller (Chiller) System and (2) as a reactant for NOx emissions reduction in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\n\n\nRipon Energy's CalARP / RMP is RMP Program Level 3 (19 CCR ?2735.4).\n\n\n\nRipon Energy maintains a Management System (19 CCR ?2735.6) that assigns responsibilities and resources for implementing EPA and CalARP/RMP provisions.  \n\nEPA RMP Registration Information (19 CCR ?2740.1) is included in the Program.\n\n\n\nRipon Energy submits to EPA (19 CCR ?2745.1) (19 CCR ?2735.5) via RMP E SUBMIT and to the San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department (Administering Agency, AA) as required.\n\n\n\nRipon Energy updates (19 CCR ?2745.10) and corrects (19 CCR ?2745.10.5) the RMP per regulation.  Ripon Energy also follows the regulation for Covered Process Modifications (19 CCR ?2745.11).\n\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment\n\n\n\nRipon Energy performs Hazard Assessment (19 CCR ?2750.1) which includes Two Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario analyses (19 CCR ?2750.3"

Ripon Energy has had zero accidental releases in the five year period preceding the date of this document.\n\n\n\nRipon Energy's documentation of Accident History would include initiating events, onsite impacts, offsite impacts, offsite response, and corrective measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 Prevention Program\n\n\n\nRipon Energy is has implemented a Prevention Program consistent with Level 3 requirements.  The Prevention Program includes:\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) (19 CCR ?2760.2)\n\nRipon Energy conducts Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) at least every five years to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with process hazards or chemical release scenarios involving the Covered Process.  The most recent PHA utilized a \"what-if analysis\" and was completed in November 2017.  Action Items are tracked to completion in Program documents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (19 CCR ?2760.3)\n\nRipon Energy maintains written procedures to operate systems in the Covered Process that include operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems functionality.  Applicable Operating Procedures are reviewed, updated, and certified annually or when changes are made to the Ammonia System.  Revisions are documented in the revision history of the procedure.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices (19 CCR ?2760.3)\n\nRipon Energy maintains written Safety Programs to ensure Safe Work that include:  "
