The site is approximately 150 acres in size and was originally an Army Corp of Engineers barge repair facility during the 1930's.  During the 1970's the site manufactured agricultural chemicals for Chemform, Inc. In 1981, CPS Chemical Co. acquired the site and originally had 10 employees.  The site grew to 240 employees by 1997 when CPS was purchased by Allied Colloids.  Ciba Specialty Chemical Co. acquired the site in 1998 with the purchase of Allied Colloids. The site was used by CPS and later Allied Colloids and Ciba Corporation and now BASF Corporation for the production of water treatment chemicals.   In 2016 BASF realigned the site eliminating the manufacture of water treatment chemicals and focused on  production of Epichlorohydrin based products as additives in the paint and ink industry.\r\n\r\n1.2) BASF Corporation's Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nBASF has established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) composed of experienced chemical operators and shift supervisors who are trained to respond to an accidental release, fire, spill, or other emergency at the West Memphis site. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910, Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) training requirements, all employees receive Awareness Level training. Chemical operators receive Technician Level training and shift supervisors receive Incident Command Level training. The site ERT operates under the same Incident Command Structure as the West Memphis Fire Department (Designated Mutual Aid Provider).\r\n\r\nIf an incident requires the site's Emergency Response Team to be activated, the incident commander will determine if"

These products are produced as solutions in water.  These monomers and polymers are used, as additives in the paint and ink industry and in paper making. \r\n\r\n3.0 ) Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios  \r\n\r\nContact Site Emergency Coordinator for additional details.\r\n\r\n4.0) General Accident Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \r\n\r\n4.1) Accident Prevention Program \r\n\r\nThe chemical processes subject to the Risk Management Plan(RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations,(OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Both regulations establish specific guidelines for safe chemical plant operations.  Recommended practices are designed both to prevent accidents from occurring and to effectively respond if an incident or accident does occur. BASF has a specific course of action and procedures in place to address the PSM and RMP  Requirements. These measures are discussed below:\r\n  \r\nSpecific Chemical information is contained in  Safety Data Sheets (SDS). Information regarding toxicity, reactivity, physical data, reactivity data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, and hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing is developed for all covered processes. Information regarding process chemistry, block-flow diagrams, safe upper and lower operating limits for process parameters, and conse"

A preventative maintenance program requires periodic inspection and testing of all vessels, protective equipment, and interlocks on processes containing hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted on each PSM and RMP covered process.  PHA information is maintained by the EH&S Department and the PSM committee,  including the priority order and schedule of future PHA's.  Process Safety Information (PSI) and PHA's are available to all employees for their review, input, and training. \r\n\r\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOP's) are routinely reviewed and updated as needed. Process training is provided prior to new process introduction.  Refresher training is conducted at a minimum of every 3 years. \r\n\r\nA Mechanical Integrity program is in place and is administered by the Maintenance Department. Changes to covered processes are implemented in accordance with the Site's Management of Change (MOC) procedure. MOC documentation including Hazard Assessment and Pre-Startup safety reviews, is maintained by the Engineering department. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation Procedures include employee participation to ensure that the fundamental causes of all incidents are correctly identified, corrective actions are identified, appropriate, and implemented in a timely manner to prevent a recurrence. \r\n\r\n4.2) Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nThe  epichlorohydrin (EPI) storage tank is equipped with a spill containment basin and fire monitors and foam deluge system to extinguish a fire if necessary.

Supervisory staff review all incident information and determine whether a release has exceeded a reportable quantity including notification of authorities as appropriate.\r\n\r\n6.0)  Emergency Response Program \r\n\r\nIf an abnormal event were to occur which releases or has the potential to release a chemical quantity which could lead to an emergency condition, the site's Incident Commander (IC) will activate the Emergency Response Team (ERT) and notify the West Memphis Fire Department. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) describes how specific events will be managed and the appropriate action to be taken by the Incident Commander and emergency responders. The West Memphis Fire Department is provided a copy of BASF's emergency response plan for review and comment.

Planning aspects of process design, operating procedures, emergency preparedness, the operational elements of system maintenance, safe operating practices, and ongoing personnel training are an integral part of and considered necessary to support a continuous improvement in facility safety. Periodic reviews of the management systems and rigorous internal audits ensure continuing compliance. \r\n\r\nThe management system provides the required and necessary information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility. This information is available to all employees and can be made readily available to emergency responders and the community. \r\n\r\nRisk Management Planning (RMP) and the integrated risk management program at BASF's West Memphis Site help to ensure operations that are safe today, and will be even safer tomorrow by providing methods to continue to identify and address potential risks to employees and the community.\r\n\r\n8.0)  Conclusion - RMP Data Elements\r\n\r\nEach facility covered by the RMP Rule must submit one Risk Management Plan (RMP) that covers all its RMP regulated processes. The plan is submitted electronically to the EPA and follows the format provided by the RMP Data Elements Guidance Document published by the EPA on June 20, 1996.  The BASF West Memphis Accident Prevention Program is adopted directly from OSHAA's PSM Standard compliance program which is consistent with EPA's Level 3 RMP Program requirements under 40 CFR part 68.  The RMP was filed electronically on June 21, 1999 and was resubmitted in June 2004, January 2006, April 2010, and September 2014."
