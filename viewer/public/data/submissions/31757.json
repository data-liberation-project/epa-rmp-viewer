In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents nor to our knowledge have we had any off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, evacuations or environmental damage.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan that, in the event of a major release, requires employees to notify other employees, call 911, and evacuate the a"
