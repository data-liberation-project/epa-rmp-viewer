In the event of a release it is the policy of the Village to minimize the effect of the release to the general public by commiting the resources necessary to stop the discharge and evacuate the effected areas.\n\nThe Main Water Plant for the Village of Palm Springs uses chlorine gas in its operation. The gas is stored in 2,000 pound steel canisters inside a room equipped with chlorine detectors.  When the detectors sense a chlorine release an active mitigation system consisting of a fan leading to an air scrubber removes the chlorine.  In addition, the chlorine delivery lines are under vacuum.  If a break in the line occurs the chlorine will not escape and the drop in pressure will cause the regulators on the chlorine cannisters to shut off the flow.  This will also set off an alarm.\n\nThe worse case scenario indicates that a catastrophic chlorine release will effect approximately 25,000 people within 1.3 miles of the facility. The alternate case scenario would effect approximately 210 people within 0.1 miles of the facility.  The Village of Palm Springs is included in the written emergency response plan for Palm Beach County.  Should a release occur the Village of Palm Springs Public Safety Department andthe  Palm Beach County Fire Rescue would be contacted.  Citizens within the effected area would be evacuated and the leak would be stopped as quickly as possible.\n\nThe only chemical included in the Risk Management Plan is chlorine.  In an effort to minimize a release to the atmosphere, the chlorine is stored in a closed room with leak detectors.  A positive response from the leak detectors activates a fan which would feed the atmosphere within the room through a scrubber.  In addition, the chlorine is delivered to the chlorine mixing room under vacuum.  A b"

A pinhole leak developed in one of the one ton chlorine canisters on February 27, 1995.  Approximately 200 residents were evacuated from the area near the Plant.  The pinhole leak was plugged and the emergency order was lifted.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, the appropriate Main Plant Personnel will be contacted to evaluate the situation.  These personnel will contact the appropriate emergancy responders such as the police, chemical suppliers, fire departments or hazmat teams.  Areas that may become effected will be evacuated by the police and/or fire departments,  the chemical suppliers and hazmat teams will mitigate the release."
