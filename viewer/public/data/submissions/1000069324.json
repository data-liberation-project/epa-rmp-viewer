Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical             | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia              17,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. \n\n\n\nOverall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 2 operates a commercial packing and storage facility for blueberries in Stockton, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\n(8) Postcooler Rooms\n\n(1) Anti-Room\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n(2) Refrigerated Domes \n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 2 is located at 2323 Port Road G, Stockton, CA 95203. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 37.947410, -121.324961. The facility is located approximately 1.5 miles south of Interstate 5 in an industrial area located along the San Joaquin River. \n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of reduced flood risk due to levee\".\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 2 is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps showed that faults within close proximity are not considered high risk:\n\nMidland Fault Zone - <1,600,000 Years\n\nVernalis Fault - <1,600,000 Years\n\n\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe Refrigerated Domes are equipped with evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation while Post-cool Rooms, Staging Area, and Loading Dock are equipped with evaporators and a pump recirculator as required fo"

The refrigeration machinery is contained within the Machinery Room and outside the Post-cool Room.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Process Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 facility is an integral part of the overall business. The process is only operational approximately 3 months out of the year. The remainder of the year, ammonia is stored in vessels. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident H"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors."

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Crowne Cold Storage Plant 2 will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
