      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\nPMC Specialties Group, Inc is an organic chemical producer located in the community of St. Bernard, Ohio.  Final products produced include high intensity sweeteners, corrosion inhibitors and specialty chemical intermediates.  Some of these products are used to improve consumer products by enhancing flavor and fragrance.  Others are used to extend the useful life of metals by preventing corrosion such as in automobile cooling systems.  The site utilizes both continuous and batch processing operations.  Raw materials used in the manufacturing of the site's products include organic chemicals, acids, bases and alcohols.  Three of the raw materials (ammonia, chlorine and sulfur dioxide) are reportable under the EPA Risk Management Plan.  Each of these three chemicals are received and stored as liquefied gases.\n\nAccident prevention and emergency response programs for the hazardous materials used on site have been in existence for many years.  The fourteen elements of OSHA's (Occupational Safety and Health Association) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29CFR1910.119), established in 1992, have an integral part of our operations since that time.  Equipment is designed, fabricated and installed to meet established industry standards and codes. Hazard analysis studies to identify potential risks, their causes, and to institute safeguards to prevent accidental releases have been completed for all the RMP chemical operations.  These are being evaluated and validated periodically.  Preventive maintenance of the equipment is handled by skilled on site maintenance personnel or approved contractors.  Critical equipment is included in a computerized mandatory maintenance program to assure its mechanical integrity.  Certified process operators are trained in routine, emergency and process safety procedures.  They use automated controls with safety interlocks, leak detection systems, regular inspections and standardized written procedures to monitor the p"

Any maintenance repair or operating procedure that deviates from established standards is reviewed, and if deemed acceptable, approved using a management of change procedure prior to implementation.  Work activity with the potential to cause a safety hazard must have special work permits and safety approvals.\n\nTo minimize the impact of an accidental chemical release, processes are equipped with emergency shutdown systems, fail safe equipment, and fire protection.   A majority of these are automatic in nature.  Specialized  chemical sensors are located throughout the site for detecting chlorine, ammonia and sulfur dioxide.  A written facility Emergency Response Plan detailing the responsibilities of the on-site response team has been in place for many years.  Annual emergency response training is conducted on site.  The site has a facility-wide emergency notification system including process alarms, speakers, radios and cellular phones.  Plant Operators are trained as OSHA Emergency First Responders and all production Supervisors are trained as OSHA On-Scene Incident Commanders.  The company maintains specialized equipment for responding to chemical releases and conducts annual emergency drills with the fire department to maintain skills and coordination.  Emergency Response is coordinated with the St. Bernard Fire Department.  If necessary, the public would be notified of an emergency through the St. Bernard Fire and Police Departments using the Hamilton County Emergency Communication System.  Under the EPA Risk Management Program requirements, no ammonia or sulfur dioxide related incident with off-site or on-site impact has occurred during the past five years.  For chlorine, one site employee has required minor medical treatment and no incident with off-site impact has occurred in the past five years.\n\nPMC Specialties Group, Inc is always working to reduce poten"

Examples include reduction of the ammonia inventory on site with the design and installation of a single tank, rather than a dual tank storage system.  The reduced volume system operates under lower pressure conditions with enhanced process controls and alarms as well as automatic and remote system shutoffs.  Similarly, the sulfur dioxide storage system pressure was previously reduced and the unloading system was simplified.  Both the ammonia and sulfur dioxide storage tanks are have dikes to capture liquid spills.  For Chlorine, upgrades to the storage facility have included equipment that minimizes the amount of chlorine that can potentially be released from the system.  Also, process alarms with automatic and remote shutoff capability have been added to minimize releases.  Recently a enclosure building was built around the chlorine storage facility and an emergency scrubbing system was installed for leaks to further reduce potential risk.\n\nThe site is also very aware of security for the facility.  Access to the site is controlled and monitored through a 24 hours security service.  All visitors and contractors must pass through security gates and log in at the security posts.  They must wear identifying badges and be hosted by site personnel will on the property.  The guard service conducts facility security inspections that are computer logged multiple times a day.  The site also has a set of security cameras that view various parts of the site.  These are tracked on monitors and electronically recorded.\n  \nPMC Specialties Group is an active member of a number of responsible organizations such as the Ohio Chemistry Technology Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufactures Association.  We strive for the high standards of the Responsible Care Program developed by the Chemical Manufacturers Association and implemented through SOCMA.
