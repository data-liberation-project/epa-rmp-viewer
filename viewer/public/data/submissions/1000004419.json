Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility \n\nThe coop board, management and employees of Watonwan Farm Service, Easton (Hwy 109), MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe facility is for storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored at the facility would be approximately 80,000 pounds in our 1-18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding approximately 40,000-45,000 pounds.    \n\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nWFS has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all tank equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections when the system is in use.  Currently, the tank is empty and without plans of usage.\n\n4.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have: \n\n1. Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \n2. To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facili"

The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release.  The next annual plan review and training for all employees is scheduled to be held in July 2009.  \n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nd. A MSDS for anhydrous ammonia as part of their emergency response plan information. \n\ne. An AWAIR program in place and is committed to a safe working environment.\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWFS Management will conduct a site review in the near future as it relates to whether the tank will again be utilized for storage.  Installation of suitable barriers in accordance with MN Rules 1513.0160 and 1513.0370 will be completed by September 1, 2009, or by any future rule date changes if the tank is kept at this facility and used for storage. When a decision is finalized, a correction to this plan will be completed within the required time frame.  If the tank is used again for storage at this facility, WFS  will undergo review and revision to the Emergency Action Plan, and train site employees.  Additionally, WFS will conduct another compliance audit and hazard review at the facility before product is stored. \n\n\n"
