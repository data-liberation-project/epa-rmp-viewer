This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nSSI/PHAE has emergency policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP); Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC); Facility Response Plan (FRP); that outline procedures for how SSI/PHAE handles spills. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on how SSI/PHAE responds to emergencies prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. These Plans also detail best management practice in place at the facility, i.e. good housekeeping, prompt routine equipment maintenance and inspections.\n\n\n\nSSI/PHAE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for SSI/PHAE is Vicki Korobka, EHS Manager of SSI/PHAE. Her work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The following individual (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) is below:\n\n\n\nKevin Morgan, Plant Manager\n\nWork: (785) 543-6719\n\n24-hour: (785) 302-1446\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nSSI/PHAE is loca"

The regulated substance stored at the facility is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\n\n\n1. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in a steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located in a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint; the model results were 0.7 mile radius and are provided as part of this documentation. Public receptors information was obtained using Circular Area Profiles (CAPS). No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternative scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud"

Public receptor information was obtained using CAPS. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nThe SSI/PHAE facility qualifies as a Program 3 for the flammable mixture (denaturant) due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information. \n\n\n\nSSI/PHAE's maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are performed and quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports per KDHE requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with the RMP covered process at the PHAE facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nSSI/PHAE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate actions taken by SSI/PHAE if a scenario should occur, including a Health and Safety. SSI/PHAE responds by calling the local authorities and has several spill response kits onsite. As mentioned, an Industrial SWPPP, SPCC and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards. The FRP contains a separate document that details emergency evacuation procedures, employees are trained on how PHAE responds to spills and countermeasures on an annual basis as part of the storm water and spill response plan requirements.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nA third-party conducts a safety audit at the SSI/PHAE facility on a bi-annual basis.
