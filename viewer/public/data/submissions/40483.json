      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe City of Glendale Water & Power has a corporate structure to assist the Water Department with compliance issues associated with release prevention and safety issues. The Water Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. Section Safety Supervisors are tasked with the implementation of the safety programs and policies at the pump station. In addition, the Department has an Accident Review Committee that is responsible for reviewing all incidents and near misses that occur at the facilities. This group is responsible for collecting all necessary information from employees (and contractors as necessary) regarding a reported incident through interview sessions. Following the data collection, the Accident Review Committee will meet to hypothesize potential causes and develop mitigation measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nVarious pump stations throughout the City of Glendale use 150-pound chlorine cylinders to treat the drinking water.  The 150-pound cylinders are delivered to the Power Plant, where Water personnel receive the delivery.  The 150-pound cylinders are stored at the Power Plant until needed at the pump station.  The maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored on site is 3,750 pounds (25, 150-pound cylinders).\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Update, which included a review of the five year accident history (May 1999 - May 2004) the City of Glendale Power Plant Storage Location has not had an acc"

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe City of Glendale Water and Power maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Plan also includes the Emergency training for all City of Glendale Water and Power employees. Since the Power Plant Storage Location is unmanned, no evacuation would be required in case of a chlorine release.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the City of Glendale Water and Power responsible person, at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Glendale Water Department has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (April 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May & June 2004). Both studies resulted in minor procedural modifications to ensure safe operation. These modifications are currently being implemented with an expected date of completion being December 1, 2004. The Safety Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are implemented. \n\nIn addition to the mitigation measures included in the Compliance Audit and Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, the Process Safety Management team continues to ensure employee involvement in Safety Pl"
