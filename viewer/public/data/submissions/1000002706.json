Under the requirements of section 112(r) of the clean Air Act (CAA), Indiana Rail Road Company (INRD Hiawatha Yard) has completed a risk management program according to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  INRD Hiawatha Yard temporarily stores chlorine, butane, ammonia, and ethylene oxide in tank cars on-site in quantities above threshold values while on route to their final destination.  INRD Hiawatha Yard falls into the RMP requirements because the motive power is removed from the cars during temporary storage.  Predictive filing was used because of the variable nature of storage at INRD Hiawatha Yard.  The quantity of each chemical was determined by evaluating the maximum quantity of each chemical expectedto be in each tank car and the expected maximum number of cars on-site.  \n\nINRD Hiawatha Yard will conduct its operations in a way as to avoid harm to its employees and all others who may be affected directly or indirectly by its activities, and to maintain the highest practically achievable standards of safety, occupational health and working environment.  All employees will take personal responsibility for their health and safety and the protection of the working environment and surrounding areas.  INRD Hiawatha Yard does not perform maintenance on the tanks containing regulated substances; therefore, reducing the risk of accidental releases associated with these chemicals.  Operations are regulated by the Department of Transportation and safety is maintained as a priority.  All employees are properly trained in operating procedures and safety programs.  There have been no accidental releases of the regulated substances in the last five years.  \n\nShould a release or other emergency occur at INRD Hiawath"

INRD Hiawatha Yard has a 24-hour dispatcher that acts as the first line of communication during an emergency and is able to contact the appropriate emergency agencies.  The initial contact will contact the dispatcher and relay appropriate information about the emergency.  In the event of an emergency, INRD Hiawatha Yard employees are not to respond to the emergency themselves but contact the appropriate emergency services (ambulance, if needed) and the dispatcher to deploy the organized Indiana Rail Road Company emergency response team and other emergency and regulatory agencies.  The emergency response team is responsible for coordinating all phases of the incident response.  \n\nINRD Hiawatha Yard will continue to evaluate safety concerns at the facility and train employees on new concerns that may arise."
