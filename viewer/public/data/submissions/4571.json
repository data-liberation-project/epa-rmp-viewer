However, remediation water from the nearby Pinal Creek \n     Water Quality Assurance Revolving Fund (WQARF) site is diverted to the facility, where it is treated\n     with ammonia to raise the pH of the incoming water, and then stored in the Diamond H open pit on the\n     Copper Cities Unit property.  This process is operated as part of an interim remedial action by the\n     Pinal Creek Group, of which BHP is one member.\n\n     Ammonia is the only regulated substance maintained by BHP Copper in an amount in excess of the \n     designated RMP threshold.  It is stored in a single 63,200-pound tank, which is operated by Pacific\n     Standard Specialties, Inc.  Current plans call for discontinuing the use of ammonia at the facility within\n     one to two years.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\n     The worst-case scenario is a tank stem knock-off, resulting in the release of the entire contents of the\n     tank over a period of about 53 minutes.  The ammonia would be released as a liquid that would\n     immediately vaporize.  According to EPA's RMPComp model, the distance to the endpoint is 2.8 miles.\n     Although the tank is located in a classically rural environment (according to limited population and lack of\n     urban development), the model was run in the urban mode since there are significant topographic\n     barriers around the tank site that would inhibit the dispersion of the released ammonia.\n\n     It should be noted that, due to the conse"

The ammonia tank system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state\n     law.  The tank and associated equipment are inspected periodically and each time the tank is filled.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\n     We have not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental\n     damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n     In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Gila County\n     Sheriff's Office and request that they respond to the emergency.
