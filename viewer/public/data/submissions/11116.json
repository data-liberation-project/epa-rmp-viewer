      "SummaryText": "Candle Corporation of America, Inc. - Distribution Center is a candle warehouse.  Propane used is for heating of the warehouse areas and the heating of hot water for the rest room facilities. A 30,000 gallon aboveground propane bulk storage tank is used to store the facilities propane.\n\nThe facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is Candle Corporations policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify Surry County Emergency Services and request their response.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the propane tank when filled with its maximum contents (88% capacity at 600F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's RMP*Comp software, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are two homes within this radius, with a maximum estimated population of 10 persons.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify Surry County Emergency Services and requests that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.  Additionally members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nAt this time we are confident in our approach to propane safety and have no projected improvements."
