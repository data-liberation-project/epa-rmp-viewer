      "SummaryText": "The Dumont Company is a distributor of industrial chemicals primarily serving the water and waste water industry.  The Labelle site has a total of five (5) on-site employees and would be considered small when compared to other related businesses.  The only material stored in sufficient quantities at this location is Chlorine, CAS# 7782-50-5.\n\nIt is the intent of the Dumont Company that all of it's employees are well trained in handling, transporting, and responding to accidental release of this product.  In addition, Dumont has provided the local fire department and the Hendry County Emergecy Management Department with facility layouts, and annual walk throughs of the facility.\n\nDumont performs the following functions at it's Labelle facility pertaining to Federal Regulations contained in 40 CFR 68.\n\n  1.  Recieves, unloads and stores vessels containing a material covered under 40 CFR 68 (chlorine) from vendors.\n  2.  Reloads and transports subject vessels to customer's premises.\n  3.  Transports, unloads, and stores empty subject vessels.\n  4.  Reloads empty vessels on vendor transportation.\n  5.  Normal storage quantities are six (6) ton containers and sixty (60) one hundred fifty pound containers.\n\nDumont does not in its normal course of business perform any of the following functions with the material subject to the regulation sited.\n\n  1.  Dumont does not consume the subject material.\n  2.  Dumont does not produce the material or convert the material into other forms.\n  3.  Dumont does not package or repackage the subject material.\n  4.  Dumont does not open subject vessels for inspection or other purposes.\n\nBecause  of the nature of the operation defined, the safety history of The Dumont Company, the attention to the safety program documented within, and it's position related to public receptors, environmental receptors and emergency responders, the risk of potential releases and related dangers are assessed as minimal to minimal-moderate.

      "SummaryText": "ario would be the rupture of a ton cylinder of Chlorine, causing gas release, that if unmitigated would have an end point of slightly over six (6) miles.  The highest possibility for such a release to occur would be an error during the handling process.  Dumont employees are continually trained and observed in the operation of handling equipment (i.e. forklifts, lifting beams). Dumont has also developed safety cradles for ton cylinders and secure racks for smaller cylinders to increase the level of safety while handling these vessels.  Enforcing of such handling procedures along with close inspection of received subject material containers, valves, fuse plugs, etc., minimize the container damage risks.  Through such safety measures and procedures Dumont maintains an outstanding record of no reportable releases."
