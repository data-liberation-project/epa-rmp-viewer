It helps maintain the trailblazing attitude which made us the first fast-food hamburger chain. The first to sell a million hamburgers. The first to sell a billion hamburgers. And the first to sell frozen fast food.\n\n\n\nBut that would just be a part of the answer. In truth, our power comes from the undying loyalty of the Cravers across the nation. It is because of them and through them that we go on. The more you crave, the more we serve. And that is why we continue to grow. More on the menu, more locations on the map and more Cravers enjoying both.\n\n\n\nWhite Castle is more than a company. It's an experience that transcends time, space and sometimes, rational thought. For almost a century our unique approach has made our food the answer to what you crave. And we're planning on that continuing long past 100 years.\n\n\n\nGone Green\n\n\n\nUnlike our delicious Sliders, the ozone is better off without holes.\n\nHow we're doing our part  \n\nHow we're doing our part\n\n\n\n?

The White Castle frozen sandwich product is shipped in corrugated cartons bearing the familiar circle of three arrows indicating their recyclable status.\n\n\n\n? One of the ways we are converting our wastes into other products or energy is the reuse of our liquid grease. This is occurring in the Outerloop Biocell located in Louisville, Kentucky. Grease trap liquids generated from cooking our hamburgers are periodically removed and transported offsite to the biocell. These liquids help sustain the biodegradation of organic materials within the biocell. This in turn reduces the volume of material within the biocell preserving valuable landfill space for future use. This reduces the need for new landfill space.\n\n\n\n? Unused and previously used marketing material, such as banners, paperboard, plastic board, etc., is donated to local schools or organizations that reuse the material for creative uses. Since January 2012 White Castle has donated over 2,000 pounds of marketing material to schools and related organizations to reuse within the classroom.\n\n\n\n?
