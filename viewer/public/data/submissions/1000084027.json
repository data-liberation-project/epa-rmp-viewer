The Design Department in Technical Services is responsible for the PSI program element.  Personnel in the Environmental, Health and Safety Department have responsibility for Hot Work, Contractors, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Emergency Response, and Employee Participation.

The refinery has comprehensive safety programs to address the federal and state regulations discussed in this document as well as all other applicable Cal-OSHA, OSHA and local regulations.  The purpose of these programs is to: \r\n\r\n1) provide a healthy and safe work environment, \r\n2) ensure safe work performance for all operations, \r\n3) establish and maintain a system to anticipate, recognize, evaluate and control occupational Health and Safety hazards,\r\n4) provide employees with appropriate information, training and protective equipment relating to potential Health and Safety hazards associated with their job assignments, and\r\n5) comply with all applicable local, state and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Compliance Program includes a refinery R&SI on environmental compliance and reporting, which clearly states that each employee has a responsibility to help protect the environment by complying with established policies and procedures.  This includes knowing the environmental limits of units and a responsibility to report all leaks.\r\n\r\nThe Program 3 Prevention Program Elements, discussed in this Risk Management Plan (RMP), are one part of the overall safety program at the Refinery.

Upon completion of the MOC, the Area Supervisor authorizes the completion of the MOC along with the approval of the PHA Coordinator.\r\n\r\nTemporary changes are those changes that are expected to exist for a limited period or a change that is being evaluated on a trial basis.  If temporary changes are required, a temporary end date is noted on the MOC form.  At the time of the end of that time, the technical evaluator must confirm that the change has been returned to original conditions, extend the temporary end date, or go through the process to make the change permanent.  \r\n\r\nEmployee/Contractor training on the change typically takes place at safety meetings or one-on-one meetings with the supervisor.  In addition, control rooms have MOC binders/log for operators to read as part of the shift change routine.  If changes involve procedures, supervisors are responsible for ensuring that their employees are trained and understand the new procedure.  This may involve one-on-one discussions or practical demonstration.  If PSI updates are required, the marked up PSI is given to the Design Group in Engineering.  The Design personnel then verifies the change prior to changing the PSI.

      "SummaryText": "fuels.  Aromatic compounds created by the Reforming units are saturated in the Benzene Saturation Unit, ensuring their removal from clean fuel production.  The Alkylation Unit combines two small molecules, a branched hydrocarbon and an olefin, to make a larger branched hydrocarbon.  This process generates alkylate, which is a high octane blending component in gasoline.  The Alkylation Unit uses Sulfuric Acid as a catalyst.  \r\n\r\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above.  The #1, #4, and #5 Gas Plants and the Light Hydrocarbon Fractionation (#1ISOM) purify these compounds.  The smallest molecules (one and two carbons) are used in the refinery for fuel.  The propanes and butanes are used as feedstocks for the Alkylation process and for commercial sale.  \r\n\r\nThe refinery has two boilers that produce high pressure, high temperature steam, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes and to drive pumps and compressors.  The Water Treatment Plants (WTP) produce high quality water for use in the boilers and process cooling systems.  The API Separator and the Waste Water Treatment (WWT) plant are part of the refinery's waste water treatment system.

The SCOT plant receives and treats sulfur-containing tailgas from the SRU, converts the sulfur containing compounds to Hydrogen Sulfide and returns the stream to the SRU for reprocessing.\r\n\r\nDescription of Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nMost of the regulated substances handled at the refinery regulated by the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and EPA's Risk Management Program are flammables.  These materials range in flammability from Pentane to Hydrogen.  For reference, a flash point is defined as the lowest temperature at which a liquid will give off sufficient vapor to ignite on application of a flame.  Larger flash points indicate less flammability.  Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions involving these compounds.   \r\n\r\nAs part of refining crude oil to motor fuels, other regulated substances are generated in addition to the flammables.  The four materials discussed here are hazardous principally through inhalation.  Hydrogen Sulfide, with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the refining streams.  Hydrogen Sulfide is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas; its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern.  Hydrogen Sulfide is not stored at the refinery.  As soon as it is generated, it is immediately sent to the Chemical Plant for processing into elemental Sulfur or Sulfuric Acid.  Ammonia is also created by the same processing units.  Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with"

Sulfur Dioxide's odor also allows it to be detected at low concentrations.  Sulfur Dioxide is not stored at the Chemical Plant; it is an intermediate in the Sulfuric Acid Recycling process.  Sulfur Trioxide is a toxic gas with a sharp odor, it also is an intermediate in the Sulfuric Acid Recycling process.\r\n\r\nCovered Processes:\r\n\r\nThe Covered Processes for the refinery are listed in the data sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe Refinery has both Program Level 1 and Program Level 3 Covered Processes as defined by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations.  A Program Level 1 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance, the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) does not go offsite, and has had no incidents meeting the CalARP reporting requirements.  A Program Level 3 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the WCS reaches an offsite receptor.  A Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is a hypothetical event and the parameters for calculating the WCS is defined in the regulations.  For calculation purposes, it is assumed that the entire contents of the regulated substance in the largest container is released.  For Flammable scenarios, it is assumed all the material explodes.  For Toxic scenarios, it is assumed that the whole container is released within a ten minute period.  Based on these mathematical assumptions, a distance can be calculated for the WCS.

The responsibilities for the management of the various risk management program elements was previously discussed.  The RMP compliance program is incorporated as part of the refinery's Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance program.  PSM is a Cal-OSHA regulation addressing process safety at industrial facilities.  RMP and PSM regulations are similar in their requirements.  PSM was enacted earlier than RMP, PSM directed that compliance development began in 1992, with completion in 1996.  However, RMP directed that compliance development begin in 1996 with completion in 1999.  Development of the RMP compliance program was the incorporation of any additional RMP requirements into the already existing PSM compliance program.  \r\n\r\nEach program element implementation is discussed in detail under the specific element sections (see Program 3 Prevention Elements).  Each element section also discusses the record retention requirements of that element.  While the Leadership Team has overall responsibility for the management of the risk management elements, personnel who have the responsibility of the elements periodically evaluate the effectiveness of their program, through an internal audit, and make changes as the need arises.  The Leadership Team also periodically reviews each program for effectiveness and sets goals and objectives for each program to provide guidance for responsible personnel about expectations for each program.  In addition, guidance from regulatory agencies provides the standard for the program elements.  Each program element is integrated into the overall organization of the refinery.

These safeguards were either originally constructed in the unit or implemented as a recommendation from a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Compliance Audit, and/or Incident Investigation.  Safeguards are examined during a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) by the PHA team for their adequacy in detecting, preventing and/or mitigating any potential hazards of the process.  If a PHA team determines that the safeguards do not adequately protect against a particular hazard, they recommend additional safeguards to the process.\r\n\r\nAs part of the PHA study, potential hazards and their safeguards are examined in a rigorous, methodical fashion for a variety of scenarios.  The primary focus is on prevention of the occurrence of a scenario.  The following gives examples of safeguards designed for prevention of a potential hazard.  Safeguards protecting against excessive pressure include high pressure alarms, pressure safety valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilities and safety valves.  Safeguards protecting against excessive temperature include high temperature alarms, manual shutdowns and automatic shutdowns.  Safeguards protecting against low temperature include insulation and heating.

Loss of containment is protected against by isolation valves, proper material selection for corrosion and temperature, avoidance of dead legs, periodic inspection, proper water draw and sampling facility design, locked valves, proper design of pipe bracing and vent locations, freeze protection, proper pipe rating, emergency block valves and excess flow valves.  Safeguards for instrument failure include periodic testing of critical safety devices, including pressure safety valves.  Many of the safeguards mentioned above are automatic safety systems that are commonly referred to as interlocks.  In addition, process areas vent to the refinery flare safety system, which safely burns the flammable material.  \r\n\r\nWhile the emphasis is on prevention of potential hazards, sometimes these events occur.  If this is the case, early detection is an important part of managing the event.  Examples of safeguards addressing detection of the occurrence of a potential scenario are discussed as follows.  Process and storage areas have leak detection systems for hydrocarbons, Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia.  Mitigation of an event is also an important part of managing the event.  Examples of safeguards addressing mitigation of potential scenarios are discussed as follows.

The program focuses on determining the facts surrounding the incident and formulating corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  The Incident Investigation program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because corrective actions are generated during investigations to prevent the incident from occurring again.\r\n\r\nThe Incident Investigation program classifies incidents into three categories, Non-Team (Minor), Small Team (Serious) and Large Team (Major).

The permits are required to certify that certain portions of the fire prevention and protection regulations have been implemented prior to beginning any hot work.  Hot work is defined as any work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations.\r\n\r\nThe refinery has a written permitting program to address Hot Work.  The purpose of the Hot Work program is to develop and implement consistent hot work practices and precautions to control tasks that may create sources that could potentially ignite.  The program also provides consistent planning and authorization of those tasks.  The Hot Work program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it provides a consistent methodology to address prevention of fires that could potentially result from ignition producing work.  In addition, the Hot Work program satisfies the requirements of the CalARP regulation and Title 8 California Code of Regulations Sections 4848 and 6777.\r\n\r\nThe Hot Work Permitting Program applies to all equipment or tasks capable of generating energy sufficient to ignite flammable/combustible materials, vapors or gasses.  The equipment and tasks are divided into two categories, high energy and low energy.

The permit requires the following information to be filled out:  the date and time of job start, equipment identification, the type of work to be performed, classification of the hot work as low or high energy, a checklist for site preparation, a checklist for any PPE requirements, a checklist for emergency provisions, and atmospheric testing results.  All permits require the performance of atmospheric tests for percent oxygen and percent hydrocarbon; the time of the test performance must be clearly documented.  Other types of atmospheric tests may also be required depending upon the nature of the work and process area.  The refinery has a work classification table that addresses the risk assessment for various tasks, including the hot work levels.  The work classification table specifies the potential hazards, protective measures required, and also specifies who is required to review and sign the permit.  These signatures mean that the permit has been reviewed, the proper tests have been performed and that the job site is safe to allow work to proceed.  If additional personnel are required for the job, each of them must also review and sign the permit.

The refinery maintenance program covers three types of maintenance:  1) preventative and predictive maintenance, 2) routine maintenance (repair or corrective maintenance), and 3) turnarounds.  Preventative maintenance is performance of equipment inspection and repair based on time and historical knowledge of the equipment.  Predictive maintenance involves utilizing technological methods of inspection to determine equipment condition.  Preventative and predictive maintenance used in combination determine the inspection and repair frequency of equipment at the refinery.  Routine maintenance is the repair or corrective maintenance of equipment as dictated by predictive maintenance, preventative maintenance and equipment condition.  A turnaround is maintenance of a process unit on a large scale.  A turnaround is the periodic shutdown of a processing unit for cleaning, internal inspection and renewal.  The process unit is opened up and its critical components are inspected and repaired during a turnaround.  The goal of the Mechanical Integrity Program is to eliminate or minimize process chemical releases by maintaining the equipment.  \r\n\r\nPredictive and Preventative Maintenance\r\n\r\nFixed Equipment:\r\n\r\nThe Inspection Department has trained inspectors for performing inspections on fixed equipment at the refinery.  Fixed equipment includes, but is not limited to equipment such as pressure relief systems (including PSVs), fractionators, reactors, separators, drums, strippers, tanks, exchangers, condensers, piping, structural equipment, etc.  The Inspection Department maintains a current list of all fixed equipment, categorized by process, which includes information on the last inspection, next planned inspection and inspection frequency.  Records of all equipment inspection are retained for the life of the equipment."

The Checklist methodology consists of a written list of items or procedural steps to verify the status of a system.  Development of generic hazard checklists allows this method to be used in combination with other PHA methods.  The use of these three methodologies together increases the probability of discovering hazards.  \r\n\r\nEach PHA performed at the refinery systematically examines potential deviations and their consequences.  Examples of some of the deviations examined include:  no flow, less flow, more flow, reverse flow, wrong concentrations, contamination of flow, misdirected flow, low temperature, high temperature, low pressure, high pressure, low levels, high levels, start-up and shutdown, leaks/rupture, mechanical seal damage, exchanger tube leaks, corrosion/erosion, mixing concerns, human factors and instrumentation.

The refinery has a comprehensive facility siting study on inhabited buildings throughout the refinery.  The inhabited and unoccupied buildings are evaluated according to the methods outlined in the API Recommended Practice 752 Management of Hazards Associated with Location of Process Plant Buildings and API Recommended Practice 753 Management of Hazards Associated with Location of Process Plant Portable Buildings.  This method involves screening the buildings for occupancy and location within the refinery.  Once this is determined, explosion, fire and toxic exposure analyses are performed.

The forms specify the actions to resolve the PHA finding or the reasons for declining the recommendation and the basis for that resolution/reasoning.  Recommendations may only be declined based on the reasons listed in PSM, RMP, CalARP or ISO.  No recommendation can be declined based on economic feasibility alone.   Action items from PHA recommendations are considered for Inherently Safer Systems by technically trained personnel.

The principal fuels produced are gasoline and diesel.  The refinery produces Propane and Butane for commercial purposes.  In addition, the refinery produces anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur for the agricultural market, as well as petroleum coke used by power plants.  The refinery also supplies Carbon Dioxide to Air Liquide for the manufacture of dry ice.  The refinery accomplishes the production of these products from crude oil through the use of many complex processing units.  The refinery processes San Joaquin Valley Crude, Alaskan North Slope Crude and a large variety of other crudes.  San Joaquin Valley Crude is an example of a heavy oil, rich in sulfur and nitrogen.  Heavy oils must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce fewer emissions upon combustion by cars and trucks.  Alaskan North Slope Crude, an example of a lighter crude, also must undergo similar processing to produce motor fuels.  \r\n\r\nCrude Oil begins its journey through the refinery at the Crude Units.  Desalters dehydrate the oil and remove salts electrically to reduce the oil's corrosivity.  It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.

A turnaround is the periodic shutdown of a processing unit for the cleaning, inspection and renewal of parts.  The process unit is opened up and its critical components are inspected and repaired during a turnaround.  Due to the size of the project, turnarounds take 6-24 months of planning.  Three criteria determine the frequency of unit turnarounds; they are:  the type of unit, the history of the unit and specific government regulations.  Typically, units undergo turnaround every two to five years.  Large unit turnarounds may require the use of 1000 contract craftspeople to complete the repairs.  \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nMaintenance Craftsperson Training:\r\n\r\nThe refinery employs experienced Journey-level Craftspeople in a number of disciplines to perform maintenance at the refinery.  Craft disciplines may include Boilermakers, Welders, Transportation (drivers), Pipefitters, Exchanger Shop Mechanics, Mechanics, Machinists, Vibration Specialists, Riggers, Carpenters/Builders, Compressor Mechanics, Valve Mechanics, Instrument Mechanics and Electricians.

The DCU also produces petroleum coke, which is black carbon powder.\r\n\r\nThe gas oil fractions from the Crude Units, the Feed Prep Units, and the Coker are still too heavy for use as motor fuels.  These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.  The FCCU cracking breaks long chain hydrocarbons into short chains and multi-ring compounds into smaller ring compounds.  In addition, olefin compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbons) are generated.  Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of emissions during engine combustion.  The olefins are removed by other process units.  The cracking process in the Hydrocracker occurs in the presence of Hydrogen gas.  Olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during the hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds.  \r\n\r\nThe Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) units remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia, which are separated and processed elsewhere.  These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to reducing emissions from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in the production of producing cleaner burning fuels.
