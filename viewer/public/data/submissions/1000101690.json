Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  In addition, a mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving ammonia have occurred during the last five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program \n\nJTM's Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with Hamilton County Emergency Management Agency which is incorporated into the facility's written Emergency Action Plan.  The plan includes procedure for notification of local fire department and outside emergency response personnel as needed.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nOur company has in place many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. Nevertheless, JTM Food Group strives to constantly improve in all areas.  The following changes are being implemented:\n\n1.  Train applicable employees in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  \n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in the development and implementation of our PSM/RMP programs.\n3.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJTM Food Group's policy is to fully comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  This includes compliance with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe Risk Management Plan, along with other safety and environmental programs already in place, enables JTM to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nJTM's emergency response program is designed to provide rapid response to suspected problems to keep hazardous materials from being released into the environment, minimize the effects of any spills and provide proper clean-up and required notifications as soon as possible following any incidents.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nJTM is a food processing facility located at 200 Sales Drive, Harrison, Ohio.  The facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than the threshold established in the regulations.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the food products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh.  The system consists of compressors, evaporators, piping and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as either a gas or a liquid in different parts of the system.  \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nJTM complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release preventi"
