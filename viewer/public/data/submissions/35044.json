This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.   However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Leedey Gas Plant is a facility in which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and contaminants removed.  Marketable natural gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane, and a pentane-natural gasoline mixture that are delivered to market via pipeline and transport vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances in which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all deve"

      "SummaryText": "loped to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.   Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures or equipment.  The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.\n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\nThis facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring.\n\nThe company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.

This facility has a policy of investigating every incident in which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent similar accident from recurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Leedey Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment. The plan details the procedures for responding to an emergency, including the release or potential release of a hazardous substance.  The procedures include instruction for response, communication, first aid, evacuation, accounting for personnel, company and agency notification procedures, and post incident cleanup and decontamination.  All emergency equipment is maintained following established procedures.  Employees are trained in the procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in the response effort.  The emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders such as local law enforcement, local and state government officials, and the local emergency planning committee.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule so employees and contractors are given the most up to date programs that are on the market today.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
