Consequently, most of the reviews / updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment cons"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Company of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of peop"

This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  Some mitigation options, though, may involve process modifications that can only be implemented during a complete downtime of the covered process.  Implementation of such modifications therefore may extend well into the future and are subject to change.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and ac"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or else the equipment use will be reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the continued safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The ExxonMobil Billings Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nHot Work and Other Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

      "SummaryText": "iewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain / control a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\n2. HF acid detectors with alarms\r\n\r\n3. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detectors with alarms\r\n\r\n4. TV surveillance cameras\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n\r\n2. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\r\n\r\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n\r\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n\r\n5. Vessel t"

These practices (and others), along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be rev"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.

The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery is coordinated with the Yellowstone County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, using the Community Alerting System if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Emergency Contact shown in Section 1.8 of this plan, Shift Superintendents are available as Emergency Contacts around-the-clock.  They can be reached at 406-657-5320.\r\n\r\nSAFETY CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Operations Integrity Management Systems form the cornerstone for continuous improvement in the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery's safety-related systems.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Billings Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, ExxonMobil modified its safety programs by adopting a concept of structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS).  Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS (most recently in 2010) and evaluated it against the international standards for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) and Occupational Health and Safety Managements Systems (OHSAS 18001)to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, Lloyd's concluded that ExxonMobil's OIMS is consistent with the intent and meets the requirements of ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the inductry leaders in the extent to which environmental, occupational health & safety management considerations have been integrated into its business processes for ongoing operations and for the planning and development of new projects.\r\n\r\nAnother example of ExxonMobil's commitment was establishing a hydrofluoric (HF) acid steering group to coordinate the release prevention and emergency response efforts of its HF alkylation units worldwide.  The group established best practices for the operation and maintenance of the units and led efforts for a consistent approach to HF acid release response through enhanced detection and automatic in"

      "SummaryText": "itiation of a water wall mitigation system.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe ExxonMobil Refinery, located near Billings, Montana, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia (>20%), hydrofluoric (HF) acid and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.  Even though anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are present in amounts less than the RMP threshold quantities, we treat them in the same way by applying the accidental release prevention and the emergency response programs.  For the purpose of the Risk Management Plan, ExxonMobil Billings Refinery considered all covered processes to be Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Billings Refinery.  EPA's Program Level 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the refinery meet Program Level 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Exxon Mobil Corporation has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at each of its operations worldwide that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this summary describes OIMS.  Further, as already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 as valid management systems to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly chang"
