This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe facility is located on a nominal 7 acre site, with paved shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are: Warehouse w/ docks; Receiving Area w/ docks; Machinery Spaces; Bottling Room & Production Areas; and Coolers. The facility produces fluid milk, ice cream and other dairy products for its distributors. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\nMajor equipment components include: compressors, condensers, receivers and other storage vessels, purgers, and a variety of heat exchanges (evaporators, air handlers, etc.).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program"

Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\n   OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and EPA Prevention Program.\n\n   Ammonia detection and alarm.\n\n   Eyewash and safety showers throughout ammonia distribution areas.\n\n   Personal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\n\n   Emergency leak repair kits.\n\n   Emergency communication systems.\n\n   Training Programs, such as Chemical Safety, Safe-Work Practices, and others.\n\n   Plant Safety Committee, trained, involved, and motivated.\n\n   Safety meetings.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents or injuries related to the ammonia refrigeration system during the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nPlant employees do not engage in emergency response and rescue for hazardous release of ammonia. Details of how employees respond to potential ammonia releases are outlined in the \"Emergency Action Plan.\" The plant utilizes the local fire department HAZMAT team for its emergency response and has communicated with that HAZMAT team on specific site hazards and protocols, as well as having hosted several HAZMAT rescue drills onsite to simulate hazardous ammonia release with their teams and the dairy plant.\n\n\n\nThe  plant's \"Emergency Action Plan and Fire Prevention Program\" has been developed in accordance with OSHA 1910.38. The plan addresses fire, explosion, spills or releases of toxics, severe weather, and other criteria. The plan details actions by facility personnel for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipment, communication responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responders, as well as notification to federal and state agencies. The Emergency Action Plan includes specific instructions regarding investigating the report of a possible release of ammonia that allows plant personnel to conduct investigations"
