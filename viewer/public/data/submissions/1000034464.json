      "SummaryText": "The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMProgram) rule, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, was published on June 1996.  This rule was developed to assist facilities in evaluating the relative risk and impact of an accidental release of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMProgram applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that stores or uses a listed chemical above a pre-determined threshold quantity (\u0015 68.115).\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements with different levels of detail. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with off-site consequences in the last five years and will have no off-site receptors in the event of a worst-case release, as defined by \u0015 68.22.  Program 3 applies to facilities in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe H.Y. Carson Filter Plant (CFP), a 25.9 MGD drinking water treatment facility, owned and operated by The Water Works Board of the City of Birmingham (Board) uses gaseous chlorine, in amounts above the threshold quantity of 2,500 lbs., which is added to treated water for disinfection. \n\nDue to the proximity of public receptors and that OSHA's PSM standard was not applicable, eligibility as a Program 1 or 3 facility was eliminated. Therefore, CFP was reviewed and a RMProgram established under the requirements for a Program 2 facility (\u0015 68.12).\n\n\u0015 68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCFP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with off-site responders, that must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  These policies are presented in the Prevention Program (PP) and Emergency Response Program (ERP) sectio"

      "SummaryText": "ns of the RMProgram as required by 40 CFR Part 68 Subparts C and E.\n\n\u0015 68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the CFP chlorination facility.  The facility is equipped with chlorine detectors.  Audible alarms automatically sound when chlorine levels reach 1 part per million, within the facility, which allows safety personnel time to respond to emergencies.  In the unlikely event of a chlorine leak, an alarm in the control room of the CFP informs the operator of the release and procedures in the ERP section of the RMProgram are initiated.\n\n\u0015 68.155\u00a9 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe PP elements are presented in the PP section of the CFP RMProgram, as required by Subpart C.  The following elements of the PP were developed with the intent of reducing the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from an accidental release of chemicals:\n\n* Safety Information                              \u0015 68.48\n* Hazard Review                                   \u0015 68.50\n* Operating Procedures                         \u0015 68.52\n* Training                                             \u0015 68.54\n* Maintenance                                      \u0015 68.56\n* Compliance Audit                               \u0015 68.58\n* Incident Investigation                           \u0015 68.60\n* Management System                          \u0015 68.15\n\n\u0015 68.155(d) Five-year Accident History\n\nCFP has not had an accident, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), within the last five years.\n\n\u0015 68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nThe ERP, as required by Subpart E, is provided in the CFP RMProgram. Emergency response plans have been coordinated with local emergency planning agencies to minimize the duration and effects of an accidental release, thereby protecting the public health and environment.\n\n\u0015 68.155(f) Safety Improvements\n\nRecommendations may be made upon the review of any accidents and/or when the RMProgram is update every five years. \n\n\nReferences"
