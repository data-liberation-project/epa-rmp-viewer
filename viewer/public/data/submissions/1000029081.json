The chlorine dosage is determined by onsite testing.\n\nThe general chlorination equation is as follows:\n\nCl2 + H2O HOCl + H+ + Cl-\n\nThis equilibrium equation is the dominant one in chlorine from vacuum chlorinators with a pH of 2 to 3 and at the instant contact when chlorine is added to any water for disinfection. The free chlorine dominates the nature of the reaction. This often results in the development of noxious compounds such as nitrogen trichloride, NCl3. In dilute solution and at pH levels above about 4, the equilibrium shown above is displaced greatly to the right, and very little chlorine exists as such in solution. The hypochlorous acid formed is a weak acid and is very poorly dissociated at pH levels below 6.\n\nAmmonia added to the water reacts with the hypochlorous acid to form monochloramine, which is the disinfection product according to the equilibrium equation:\n\nNH3 + HOCL --> NH2Cl + H2O.\n\nThe disinfection process includes the chlorine supply, chlorinators, the ammonia supply, direct feed ammoniators, and injectors. The chlorine injector points are the controlling component. The injectors are used to create a vacuum that is used to draw the chlorine gas from the chlorine container through the chlorinator, and into the injector. The chlorinator meters the volume of chlorine solution at the injector, the chlorine dissolves in the injector water supply to form hypochlorous acid. From the injector, the hypochlorous acid solution flows to the point where it is injected into the pre-treated water. The differential pressure across the chlorinator (the measuring device) may be held constant or varied in accordance with the flow by changing the degree of vacuum.\n\nAmmonia and chlorine are added while the filtered water is conveyed to the clearwell storage. Ammonia forms monochloramines from its reaction with the hypochlorous acid. Chloramines are a weaker disinfectant than chlorine and less reactive with organic materials present in water. An advantage of using chloramines as a disinfectant is the production of lower concentrations of disinfection by-products in the distribution system.\n\nThe contact time and the chlorine residual are the two principal factors involved in achieving effective viral, protozoan, and bacterial kill. The contact is usually specified by the USEPA and may range from 15 to 45 minutes. The appropriate chlorine residual is monitored and controlled by residual chlorine testing. System controls maintain 2 milligram per liter (mg/l) chlorine residual to provide continual protection throughout distribution from the treatment plant to the end-user tap.\n\nMaximum Intended Inventory\n\nThe maximum intended inventory for chlorine is 120,000 pounds. The maximum intended inventory for anhydrous ammonia is 41,200 pounds.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-5\n\nSafe Upper and Lower Limits\n\nTABLE 3-3\n\nSafe Upper and Lower Limits\n\nVariable\n\nChlorine\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nMaximum tank pressure (psi)\n\n250\n\n265\n\nMinimum Temperature (?X F)\n\n55\n\n50\n\nMaximum Flow Rate in pounds per day (ppd)\n\n8,000\n\n2,000\n\nMaximum Chlorine Injector Pressure in pounds per square inch (psi)\n\n160\n\nNot applicable\n\nMinimum Chlorine Injector Pressure (psi)\n\n20\n\nNot applicable\n\nConsequences of Deviation\n\nTABLE 3-4\n\nConsequences of Deviation for Chlorine\n\nWhat-if variables\n\nResult\n\nWhat if tank pressure exceeds 250 psi?\n\nPressure release valves are designed to vent the tank at the top if the temperature or pressure gets too high\n\nWhat if the temperature of the process equipment goes below the minimum temperature?\n\nChlorine flow would be reduced, and as the temperature continues to drop the lines could freeze and chlorine flow would stop completely\n\nWhat if the maximum flow rate exceeds 8,000 (ppd)?\n\nAt 55 deg F, without vaporizers, flows exceeding 3,520 ppd would result in freezing of the tank\n\nWhat if the maximum injector pressure exceeds 160 (psi)?\n\nEroding of some of the metal could occur, equipment failure could result, and vacuum pressure would disappear.

The codes and standards are such as those published by the following, along with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices:\n\n?h American Society of Mechanical Engineers,\n\n?h American Petroleum Institute\n\n?h American Institute of Chemical Engineers\n\n?h American National Standards Institute\n\n?h American Society of Testing and Materials\n\n?h National Fire Protection Association\n\nProcess equipment information for materials of construction, Piping and Instrument Diagrams (P&IDs), electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation system design, material and energy balances, and safety systems, as applicable or available, is provided below and in equipment manuals, as listed in Tables 3-6 and 3-7. Equipment Manuals are maintained in the Maintenance Tech Room.\n\n3.3 Process Hazard Analysis\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is required to be performed in accordance with accepted methodologies (i.e. What If Analysis). This PHA must be revalidated and updated once every 5 years and involves personnel operating the process. Provided there are no equipment, process or chemical changes, the PHA will be revalidated in 5 years, otherwise the PHA will be revalidated after equipment and process changes are implemented before the process is started up.\n\nThe PHA provisions of the PSM standard require that employers complete analyses of all affected processes in May 1997. The RMP rule recognizes hazard analyses performed to meet PSM requirements for a PHA, as an initial PHA under RMP.\n\nThe PHA documents recommendations to management to minimize or eliminate hazards, for mitigating the consequences of hazards of any releases or other unplanned events, and for reducing the likelihood of exposure to chlorine or other toxic materials. For each potential hazard identified, the PHA report describes:\n\n?h The particular hazard;\n\n?h Possible causes of the hazardous situation;\n\n?h Potential consequences of the hazardous situation; and\n\n?h !?Action items\" based on the recommendations.\n\nResolution of recommendations will be documented, including documentation of actions to be taken and a written schedule of when actions are to be completed and when actions are completed. Communication of these actions will be conducted for operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nThe two most recent PHAs (2004 and 2012) are provided in Appendix D. The most recent PHA was completed using a What-if checklist.

This procedural form includes the following elements:\n\n?h The technical basis for the proposed change\n\n?h Impact of change on safety and health\n\n?h Modifications to operating procedures\n\n?h Necessary time period for the change\n\n?h Authorization requirements for the proposed change\n\nEmployees involved in operating the chlorine and/or anhydrous ammonia systems, and anyone performing maintenance on the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems (i.e. contractors) whose job tasks will be affected by a change, will be informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the systems. In addition, if a modification results in a change to process safety information or operating procedures, this information will be updated to reflect the change in information.\n\nIn the event that the Management of Change process is conducted, ensure that the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix H. The date of the most recent change that triggered management of change procedures will be found in Appendix H.\n\n3.8 Pre-Startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications that procedures and training have been implemented, and that hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved.\n\nIt is important that a safety review takes place before chlorine or anydrous ammonia or any other highly hazardous substance regulated by OSHA and the USEPA is introduced into the process. The intent of this review procedure is to ensure that the requirements for startup of process elements after shutdown are clearly documented and provided to personnel associated with the system. The requirements of this section apply whenever the WTP is shutdown for routine and non-routine maintenance, whenever the process is modified or new chemicals are introduced into the process, or after an emergency shutdown of a system. The pre-startup safety review procedure is designed to ensure that a pre-startup review will be conducted before chlorine or anhydrous ammonia is introduced into the process for new and modified facilities when the modification necessitates a change to process safety information. This review will confirm the following:\n\n?h Construction and installation of new equipment is in accordance with design specifications\n\n?h Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n\n?h A PHA (What-If study) conducted has been conducted and recommendations have been resolved for new or modified processes\n\n?h Training of each employee involved in the process has been completed\n\nA site committee will be established to conduct the review. As part of the pre-startup safety review, WTP management will assure that the construction and equipment is in accordance with specifications, and that the training of each employee involved in the operating process of this particular section has been completed. All modifications will be reviewed and a PHA will be conducted to verify that the chlorine or ammonia processes can be safely operated. The original PHA will be updated appropriately.\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review form is provided in Appendix I. In the event that the Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-19\n\nprocess is conducted, ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix I, and that the appropriate signatures are obtained prior to system startup. The date of the most recent pre-startup review will be found in Appendix I.\n\n3.9 Compliance Audits\n\nA key component of the RMP/PSMP compliance audit program is self-evaluation of program effectiveness on a periodic basis. The objective of the self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP/PSMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel. The RMP/PSMP will be reviewed at least every three years (per regulation).\n\nFindings of the audit are documented along with appropriate response to each finding along with documentation for correction of deficiencies. The assessment includes a review of all program elements as presented in this RMP/PSMP. Team members that participate in the Compliance Audit include the Plant Manager, Safety and Training Specialists, Water Operations Supervisor, and Maintenance Supervisor. The Plant Manager is responsible for providing written follow-up and completion of assessment findings.\n\nA Compliance Audit Form and copies of current Compliance Audits that were conducted are provided in Appendix J. Ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix J.\n\n3.10 Incident Investigation\n\nIncident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures must be prepared and implemented for any incident that resulted in an emergency situation (chlorine and/or anhydrous ammonia release). Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. The PSM standard and the RMP rule require that a comprehensive incident investigation program is in place to examine and correct deficiencies that may have allowed the incident to occur.\n\nThe OCWUT has developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations, remedial activities, and follow up. An incident investigation must be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. All incidents involving the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia system must be reported to the Plant Manager immediately.\n\nAn incident investigation team will be established to thoroughly investigate and analyze each such incident. The membership of the investigation team will include at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience.\n\nThe investigation team must prepare a report at the conclusion of the investigation, which includes at a minimum:\n\n?h Date of the incident\n\n?h Date investigation began\n\n?h A description of the incident\n\n?h The factors that contributed to the incident\n\n?h Any recommendations resulting from the investigation\n\nThe Incident Investigation Procedure is provided in Appendix K. Investigation reports (should there be a qualified release) are maintained by the Safety and Training Specialist and a copy will be provided in Appendix K. There have been no accidental releases within the past 5 years that qualify for inclusion in the RMP.\n\nThe report by the investigation team is reviewed with all affected personnel, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings, including contract employees where applicable.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-20\n\nIn addition to an OCWUT investigation, a major release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia may be investigated by the Chemical Safety Board. The Chemical Safety Board is an independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents to protect workers, the public, and the environment. The Chemical Safety Board conducts root cause investigations at fixed industrial facilities. The causes are usually found to be deficiencies in safety management systems, equipment failures, human errors, or unforeseen chemical reactions. The agency does not issue fines or citations, but does make recommendations to plants, regulatory agencies such as OSHA and the USEPA, industry organizations, and labor groups. Congress designed the Chemical Safety Board to be non-regulatory and independent of other agencies so that its investigations might, where appropriate, review the effectiveness of regulations and regulatory enforcement.\n\nReleases of reportable quantities should always be reported to the National Response Center, which is the sole federal point of contact for reporting oil and chemical spills (note: reportable quantity thresholds are provided in Section 4.2.3).\n\nAn Incident Investigation Review Form is provided in Appendix K. In the event that an incident occurs and an investigation is conducted, ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix K. Ensure that the completion date for any changes resulting from the investigation are also included. The date of the most recent incident investigations will be located in Appendix K.\n\n3.11 Employee Participation\n\nOSHA requires that a written employee participation plan be developed that insures employers consult with their employees and their representatives regarding the employers efforts in the development and implementation of the process safety management program elements and hazard assessments. The main reason for assuring this involvement is due to the wealth of information the employees who work with the hazardous chemicals and processes have which would enable management to develop an effective program.\n\nLake Draper WTP management is committed to involving employees, or their representatives, in supporting the elements of the RMP/PSMP. The following elements involve employee participation regarding the RMP/PSMP:\n\n?h Involve employees in the PHA, Compliance Audits, and RMP/PSMP reviews and updates\n\n?h Provide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\n?h Present an overview of RMP/PSMP requirements to staff annually at a weekly safety talk\n\n?h Grant access to contractors, whose work is covered by the rules, to the appropriate information contained in this RMP/PSMP and to hazard analyses as required by the PSM and RMP rules\n\n?h Involve employees in the development and updating of training\n\n?h Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\n3.12 Hot Work Permit\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes has been implemented at OCWUT. OCWUT Hot Work procedures and standard permit are provided in Appendix L.\n\nThe intent of the Hot Work Procedure is to control non-routine work conducted in the chlorination facility, specifically the permitting of hot work operations in the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia process areas. Hot work permits for hot work operations are in compliance with the following:\n\n?h Fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a)\n\n?h Implemented prior to hot work operations\n\n?h Identify the object on which hot work is to be performed\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-21\n\n?h The permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations\n\n3.13 Contractors\n\nThe PSM standard and the RMP rule include special provisions for contractors and their employees to emphasize the importance of working safely around the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes and to know how to respond in event of emergency.\n\n3.13.1 Owner or Operator Responsibilities\n\nOCWUT and Lake Draper WTP management responsibilties include the following:\n\n?h The owner or operator, when selecting a contractor, shall obtain and evaluate information regarding the contract owner or operator's safety performance and programs. This requirement shall be completed prior to contractor commencing work. For contractors working on or near chlorine or anhydrous ammonia processes are also required to submit hazardous material training records and Hot Work Permits to OCWUT prior to commencement of work.\n\n?h The owner or operator shall inform contract owner or operator of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.

The chlorine dosage is determined by onsite testing.\n\nThe general chlorination equation is as follows:\n\nCl2 + H2O HOCl + H+ + Cl-\n\nThis equilibrium equation is the dominant one in chlorine from vacuum chlorinators with a pH of 2 to 3 and at the instant contact when chlorine is added to any water for disinfection. The free chlorine dominates the nature of the reaction. This often results in the development of noxious compounds such as nitrogen trichloride, NCl3. In dilute solution and at pH levels above about 4, the equilibrium shown above is displaced greatly to the right, and very little chlorine exists as such in solution. The hypochlorous acid formed is a weak acid and is very poorly dissociated at pH levels below 6.\n\nAmmonia added to the water reacts with the hypochlorous acid to form monochloramine, which is the disinfection product according to the equilibrium equation:\n\nNH3 + HOCL --> NH2Cl + H2O.\n\nThe disinfection process includes the chlorine supply, chlorinators, the ammonia supply, direct feed ammoniators, and injectors. The chlorine injector points are the controlling component. The injectors are used to create a vacuum that is used to draw the chlorine gas from the chlorine container through the chlorinator, and into the injector. The chlorinator meters the volume of chlorine solution at the injector, the chlorine dissolves in the injector water supply to form hypochlorous acid. From the injector, the hypochlorous acid solution flows to the point where it is injected into the pre-treated water. The differential pressure across the chlorinator (the measuring device) may be held constant or varied in accordance with the flow by changing the degree of vacuum.\n\nAmmonia and chlorine are added while the filtered water is conveyed to the clearwell storage. Ammonia forms monochloramines from its reaction with the hypochlorous acid. Chloramines are a weaker disinfectant than chlorine and less reactive with organic materials present in water. An advantage of using chloramines as a disinfectant is the production of lower concentrations of disinfection by-products in the distribution system.\n\nThe contact time and the chlorine residual are the two principal factors involved in achieving effective viral, protozoan, and bacterial kill. The contact is usually specified by the USEPA and may range from 15 to 45 minutes. The appropriate chlorine residual is monitored and controlled by residual chlorine testing. System controls maintain 2 milligram per liter (mg/l) chlorine residual to provide continual protection throughout distribution from the treatment plant to the end-user tap.\n\nMaximum Intended Inventory\n\nThe maximum intended inventory for chlorine is 120,000 pounds. The maximum intended inventory for anhydrous ammonia is 41,200 pounds.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-5\n\nSafe Upper and Lower Limits\n\nTABLE 3-3\n\nSafe Upper and Lower Limits\n\nVariable\n\nChlorine\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nMaximum tank pressure (psi)\n\n250\n\n265\n\nMinimum Temperature (?X F)\n\n55\n\n50\n\nMaximum Flow Rate in pounds per day (ppd)\n\n8,000\n\n2,000\n\nMaximum Chlorine Injector Pressure in pounds per square inch (psi)\n\n160\n\nNot applicable\n\nMinimum Chlorine Injector Pressure (psi)\n\n20\n\nNot applicable\n\nConsequences of Deviation\n\nTABLE 3-4\n\nConsequences of Deviation for Chlorine\n\nWhat-if variables\n\nResult\n\nWhat if tank pressure exceeds 250 psi?\n\nPressure release valves are designed to vent the tank at the top if the temperature or pressure gets too high\n\nWhat if the temperature of the process equipment goes below the minimum temperature?\n\nChlorine flow would be reduced, and as the temperature continues to drop the lines could freeze and chlorine flow would stop completely\n\nWhat if the maximum flow rate exceeds 8,000 (ppd)?\n\nAt 55 deg F, without vaporizers, flows exceeding 3,520 ppd would result in freezing of the tank\n\nWhat if the maximum injector pressure exceeds 160 (psi)?\n\nEroding of some of the metal could occur, equipment failure could result, and vacuum pressure would disappear.

Equipment Manuals are maintained in the Maintenance Tech Room.\n\n3.3 Process Hazard Analysis\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is required to be performed in accordance with accepted methodologies (i.e. What If Analysis). This PHA must be revalidated and updated once every 5 years and involves personnel operating the process. Provided there are no equipment, process or chemical changes, the PHA will be revalidated in 5 years, otherwise the PHA will be revalidated after equipment and process changes are implemented before the process is started up.\n\nThe PHA provisions of the PSM standard require that employers complete analyses of all affected processes in May 1997. The RMP rule recognizes hazard analyses performed to meet PSM requirements for a PHA, as an initial PHA under RMP.\n\nThe PHA documents recommendations to management to minimize or eliminate hazards, for mitigating the consequences of hazards of any releases or other unplanned events, and for reducing the likelihood of exposure to chlorine or other toxic materials. For each potential hazard identified, the PHA report describes:\n\n?h The particular hazard;\n\n?h Possible causes of the hazardous situation;\n\n?h Potential consequences of the hazardous situation; and\n\n?h !?Action items\" based on the recommendations.\n\nResolution of recommendations will be documented, including documentation of actions to be taken and a written schedule of when actions are to be completed and when actions are completed. Communication of these actions will be conducted for operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nThe two most recent PHAs (2004 and 2012) are provided in Appendix D. The most recent PHA was completed using a What-if checklist. Process controls in use include manual monitoring of the chlorine system and daily inspections of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia storage and use areas. Mitigation systems include the use of vacuum pressure for the chlorine system (when pressure is lost the system shuts down). Monitoring and detection systems are provided in Section 2.1 and Section 3.4.4.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-7\n\nTABLE 3-6\n\nEquipment Information for Chlorine\n\nEquipment\n\nEquipment Information/Location\n\nStorage Tanks\n\nStorage tanks are made of steel with a pressure relief valve at the top of each tank and excessive flow shut off valves at the bottom of the tanks\n\nPiping Systems (including valves)\n\nPiping systems are made of steel, Polyvinyl Chloride, or ductile iron and include valves in strategic locations\n\nRelief and Vent Systems\n\nVent systems in the Chlorine Room are made of steel and have emergency shut offs outside of the buildings (scrubber system is located at Chlorine Room)\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems (manual and automatic)\n\nInformation included for each process equipment and in applicable equipment manuals\n\nControls (including sensors, alarms)\n\nSCADA Information is maintained in the Operations Room.\n\nOperation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 17164-Analyzers-Gas Detectors\n\nOperation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 17200 Control Panels General (LCP!|s)\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264G !V Chlorination Equipment and Accessories\n\nEvaporators\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264G !V Chlorination Equipment and Accessories\n\nFeeders (chlorinators)\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264G !V Chlorination Equipment and Accessories\n\nInjectors\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264G !V Chlorination Equipment and Accessories\n\nRegulators\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264G !V Chlorination Equipment and Accessories\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-8\n\nTABLE 3-7\n\nEquipment Information for Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nEquipment\n\nEquipment Information/Location\n\nStorage Tanks\n\nStorage tanks are made of steel with pressure relief valves at the top of each tank and excessive flow shut off valves at the bottom of the tanks\n\nPiping Systems (including valves)\n\nPiping systems are made of steel, Polyvinyl Chloride, or ductile iron and include valves in strategic locations\n\nRelief and Vent Systems\n\nVent systems in the Ammonia Building are made of steel and have emergency shut offs outside of the buildings\n\nEmergency Shutdown Systems (manual and automatic)\n\nInformation included for each process equipment and in applicable equipment manuals\n\nControls (including sensors, alarms)\n\nSCADA Information is maintained in the Operations Room.\n\nOperation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 17200 Control Panels General (LCP!|s)\n\nOperation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 17164-Analyzers-Gas Detectors\n\nVaporizers\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264H !V Ammonia Storage and Feed System\n\nFeeders (ammoniators)\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264H !V Ammonia Storage and Feed System\n\nRegulators/PRVs\n\nFinal Operation and Maintenance Data for: Oklahoma City-Lake Stanley Draper WTP; Improvements and Expansion of the Draper WTP from 90 MGD to 124 MGD; 11264H !V Ammonia Storage and Feed System\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-9\n\n3.4 Operating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures and information have been developed, implemented, and maintained for each hazardous process, including steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.

Sample inspection documentation forms are provided in Appendix G. Daily (every 2 hours) operational logs are maintained in the chlorine feeder room and ammoniator room. C-Kit inspection records are maintained with the equipment. General PPE such as respirators, tyvex suits, Class A suits, rubber gloves, etc. are maintained on site and inspected regularly for good condition and functionality. Respiratory protection inspection, maintenance, and cleaning procedures are followed by employees based on the Respiratory Protection Program provided in Appendix F.\n\n3.6.3 Equipment Deficiencies\n\nDeficiencies in equipment that are outside acceptable limits (as defined by the process safety information found in Sec. 68.65 of the CAA) are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n\n3.6.4 Quality Assurance\n\nEquipment used to store, process, or handle chlorine and ammonia will be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of accidental releases. The first line of defense available is to operate and maintain the process as designed and to keep the chlorine and ammonia contained.\n\nIn the construction of new equipment, assurance that equipment is suited for the process application for which they are intended will be conducted. Appropriate checks and inspections will be performed to assure that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and the manufacturer!|s instructions. Maintenance materials, spare parts, and equipment are suited for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n3.7 Management of Change\n\nA program has been implemented to prevent incidents caused by changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures. Management of Change requirements of the RMP/PSMP prohibits any changes to the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia systems without proper review.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-18\n\nThe intent of Management of Change is to ensure that all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions concerning chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (other than replacement-in-kind) are assessed prior to implementation of the change. In addition, Management of Change is designed to ensure proper project approvals are obtained prior to any modifications (other than \"in-kind\") at the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems. A Management of Change procedural form is provided in Appendix H. This procedural form includes the following elements:\n\n?h The technical basis for the proposed change\n\n?h Impact of change on safety and health\n\n?h Modifications to operating procedures\n\n?h Necessary time period for the change\n\n?h Authorization requirements for the proposed change\n\nEmployees involved in operating the chlorine and/or anhydrous ammonia systems, and anyone performing maintenance on the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems (i.e. contractors) whose job tasks will be affected by a change, will be informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the systems. In addition, if a modification results in a change to process safety information or operating procedures, this information will be updated to reflect the change in information.\n\nIn the event that the Management of Change process is conducted, ensure that the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix H. The date of the most recent change that triggered management of change procedures will be found in Appendix H.\n\n3.8 Pre-Startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications that procedures and training have been implemented, and that hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved.\n\nIt is important that a safety review takes place before chlorine or anydrous ammonia or any other highly hazardous substance regulated by OSHA and the USEPA is introduced into the process. The intent of this review procedure is to ensure that the requirements for startup of process elements after shutdown are clearly documented and provided to personnel associated with the system. The requirements of this section apply whenever the WTP is shutdown for routine and non-routine maintenance, whenever the process is modified or new chemicals are introduced into the process, or after an emergency shutdown of a system. The pre-startup safety review procedure is designed to ensure that a pre-startup review will be conducted before chlorine or anhydrous ammonia is introduced into the process for new and modified facilities when the modification necessitates a change to process safety information. This review will confirm the following:\n\n?h Construction and installation of new equipment is in accordance with design specifications\n\n?h Safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n\n?h A PHA (What-If study) conducted has been conducted and recommendations have been resolved for new or modified processes\n\n?h Training of each employee involved in the process has been completed\n\nA site committee will be established to conduct the review. As part of the pre-startup safety review, WTP management will assure that the construction and equipment is in accordance with specifications, and that the training of each employee involved in the operating process of this particular section has been completed. All modifications will be reviewed and a PHA will be conducted to verify that the chlorine or ammonia processes can be safely operated. The original PHA will be updated appropriately.\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review form is provided in Appendix I. In the event that the Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-19\n\nprocess is conducted, ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix I, and that the appropriate signatures are obtained prior to system startup. The date of the most recent pre-startup review will be found in Appendix I.\n\n3.9 Compliance Audits\n\nA key component of the RMP/PSMP compliance audit program is self-evaluation of program effectiveness on a periodic basis. The objective of the self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP/PSMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel. The RMP/PSMP will be reviewed at least every three years (per regulation).\n\nFindings of the audit are documented along with appropriate response to each finding along with documentation for correction of deficiencies. The assessment includes a review of all program elements as presented in this RMP/PSMP. Team members that participate in the Compliance Audit include the Plant Manager, Safety and Training Specialists, Water Operations Supervisor, and Maintenance Supervisor. The Plant Manager is responsible for providing written follow-up and completion of assessment findings.\n\nA Compliance Audit Form and copies of current Compliance Audits that were conducted are provided in Appendix J. Ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix J.\n\n3.10 Incident Investigation\n\nIncident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures must be prepared and implemented for any incident that resulted in an emergency situation (chlorine and/or anhydrous ammonia release). Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. The PSM standard and the RMP rule require that a comprehensive incident investigation program is in place to examine and correct deficiencies that may have allowed the incident to occur.\n\nThe OCWUT has developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations, remedial activities, and follow up. An incident investigation must be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. All incidents involving the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia system must be reported to the Plant Manager immediately.\n\nAn incident investigation team will be established to thoroughly investigate and analyze each such incident. The membership of the investigation team will include at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience.\n\nThe investigation team must prepare a report at the conclusion of the investigation, which includes at a minimum:\n\n?h Date of the incident\n\n?h Date investigation began\n\n?h A description of the incident\n\n?h The factors that contributed to the incident\n\n?h Any recommendations resulting from the investigation\n\nThe Incident Investigation Procedure is provided in Appendix K. Investigation reports (should there be a qualified release) are maintained by the Safety and Training Specialist and a copy will be provided in Appendix K. There have been no accidental releases within the past 5 years that qualify for inclusion in the RMP.\n\nThe report by the investigation team is reviewed with all affected personnel, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings, including contract employees where applicable.\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-20\n\nIn addition to an OCWUT investigation, a major release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia may be investigated by the Chemical Safety Board. The Chemical Safety Board is an independent federal agency that investigates chemical accidents to protect workers, the public, and the environment. The Chemical Safety Board conducts root cause investigations at fixed industrial facilities. The causes are usually found to be deficiencies in safety management systems, equipment failures, human errors, or unforeseen chemical reactions. The agency does not issue fines or citations, but does make recommendations to plants, regulatory agencies such as OSHA and the USEPA, industry organizations, and labor groups. Congress designed the Chemical Safety Board to be non-regulatory and independent of other agencies so that its investigations might, where appropriate, review the effectiveness of regulations and regulatory enforcement.\n\nReleases of reportable quantities should always be reported to the National Response Center, which is the sole federal point of contact for reporting oil and chemical spills (note: reportable quantity thresholds are provided in Section 4.2.3).\n\nAn Incident Investigation Review Form is provided in Appendix K. In the event that an incident occurs and an investigation is conducted, ensure the form is completed and a hard copy is placed in Appendix K. Ensure that the completion date for any changes resulting from the investigation are also included. The date of the most recent incident investigations will be located in Appendix K.\n\n3.11 Employee Participation\n\nOSHA requires that a written employee participation plan be developed that insures employers consult with their employees and their representatives regarding the employers efforts in the development and implementation of the process safety management program elements and hazard assessments. The main reason for assuring this involvement is due to the wealth of information the employees who work with the hazardous chemicals and processes have which would enable management to develop an effective program.\n\nLake Draper WTP management is committed to involving employees, or their representatives, in supporting the elements of the RMP/PSMP. The following elements involve employee participation regarding the RMP/PSMP:\n\n?h Involve employees in the PHA, Compliance Audits, and RMP/PSMP reviews and updates\n\n?h Provide employee access to the RMP/PSMP\n\n?h Present an overview of RMP/PSMP requirements to staff annually at a weekly safety talk\n\n?h Grant access to contractors, whose work is covered by the rules, to the appropriate information contained in this RMP/PSMP and to hazard analyses as required by the PSM and RMP rules\n\n?h Involve employees in the development and updating of training\n\n?h Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\n3.12 Hot Work Permit\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes has been implemented at OCWUT. OCWUT Hot Work procedures and standard permit are provided in Appendix L.\n\nThe intent of the Hot Work Procedure is to control non-routine work conducted in the chlorination facility, specifically the permitting of hot work operations in the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia process areas. Hot work permits for hot work operations are in compliance with the following:\n\n?h Fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a)\n\n?h Implemented prior to hot work operations\n\n?h Identify the object on which hot work is to be performed\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\n3-21\n\n?h The permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations\n\n3.13 Contractors\n\nThe PSM standard and the RMP rule include special provisions for contractors and their employees to emphasize the importance of working safely around the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia processes and to know how to respond in event of emergency.\n\n3.13.1 Owner or Operator Responsibilities\n\nOCWUT and Lake Draper WTP management responsibilties include the following:\n\n?h The owner or operator, when selecting a contractor, shall obtain and evaluate information regarding the contract owner or operator's safety performance and programs. This requirement shall be completed prior to contractor commencing work. For contractors working on or near chlorine or anhydrous ammonia processes are also required to submit hazardous material training records and Hot Work Permits to OCWUT prior to commencement of work.\n\n?h The owner or operator shall inform contract owner or operator of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. All contractors working on-site receive training on hazards on-site with a power point presentation by the Plant Manager.\n\n?h The owner or operator shall explain to the contract owner or operator the applicable provisions of Emergency Response and Emergency Response Action Plan. All contractors working on-site receive training on emergency response procedures and evacuation procedures with a power point presentation by the Plant Manager.\n\n?h The owner or operator shall develop and implement safe work practices consistent with operating procedures, to control the entrance, presence, and exit of the contract owner or operator and contract employees in covered process areas. Safe work practices of contractors must comply with OCWUT safe work practices in covered process areas. A Contractor Safety Procedure is provided in Appendix M. An evaluation form to document a contractor!|s safety performance is provided in Appendix M. The date of the most recent evaluation of contractor safety will be located in Appendix M.\n\n?h The owner or operator shall periodically evaluate the performance of the contract owner or operator in fulfilling their obligations as specified below. Contractor work shall be periodically evaluated through observation and inspections by WTP personnel and the Safety and Training Specialist.\n\n?h The owner shall maintain a contract employee injury and illness log related to the contractor!|s work in process areas. An injury and illness log is maintained at the WTP.\n\nChlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia Deliveries: OCWUT and WTP management ensure that the supplier!|s safety and compliance performance is satisfactory. During the transfer or filling of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia tanks, at least one adequately trained WTP employee accompanies the supplier at all times to ensure that proper operation and safety procedures are followed.\n\n3.13.2 Contract Owner or Operator Responsibilities\n\nThe contractor is expected to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP rules. Contractor responsibilities under this RMP/PSMP include the following:\n\n?h The contract owner or operator shall assure that each contract employee is trained in the work practices necessary to safely perform his/her job. Contractors are required to provide employee training records prior to commencement of work on or near chlorine and/or anhydrous ammonia processes.\n\n?h The contract owner or operator shall assure that each contract employee is instructed in the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to his/her job and the process, and the applicable provisions of\n\nLAKE DRAPER WATER TREATMENT PLANT,\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN AND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nMARCH 2012\n\nthe emergency action plan.
