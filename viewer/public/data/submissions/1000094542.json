The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.3.1.10   Employee Participation - The Plant developed a written employee participation program for all covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the plant. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHA's and operating procedures.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.3.1.11   Hot Work Permits - The Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Computer-based training modules, classroom training, and on-the-job training with experienced operators are used to conduct this training.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can resume work in the process. The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Refresher training is conducted on a minimum of every three (3) years.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.3.1.5  Mechanical Integrity - The Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.
