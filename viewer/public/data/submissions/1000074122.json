This is a relatively new stationary source.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia - which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively new process that falls under the RMP regulations due to its ammonia inventory being above the threshold level.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an ammonia inventory of approximately 33,996 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA\u00bfs PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\nThe facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Ammonia Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  This program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  The plan has been submitted to the local LEPC.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\r\nThis food distribution facility operates a two temperatures, single stage, anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigeration system with a maximum engine room capacity of 838.4 TR @ +30\u00b0F high-temperature suction and 967.0 TR @ +15\u00b0F low-temperature suction.  The refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators.  Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant.  Rotary screw compressors are used in the refrigeration system.  Engine room electrical classificatio"

Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation.  The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air outside which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT"

The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup, normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency \r\nshutdowns: and startup following a shutdown.\r\n\r\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.  The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing bids.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems.  This involves process safety information, process hazards analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside"

      "SummaryText": "This hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the \u00bfRisk Management Program guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\u00bf as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature re-circulator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia.  This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver.  The worst case release is based on over-filling the vessel causing a release of the vapor and liquid in the vessel with no piping volume included.  The worst-case scenario is estimated to be 8869 pounds of ammonia over a ten minute period.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario evaluated in this hazard assessment is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes.  This is considered to be the most likely scenario capable of having off-site consequences.  The  of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (66.9 pounds/minute) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP.  Following is an overview. \r\n\r\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.\r\nAs a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.

All employees have access to the PSM Program.  Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM Program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing accident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.  Community involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire Department and LEPC.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information.  These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping.  There are three major categories of information; ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.,; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety\r\nsystem/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the what-if technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact.

The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - An incident Investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia.
