This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur. We have invested and continue to invest substantial effort and capital in maintaining our strong safety and environmental performance.\r\n\r\nSafety is a day-to-day focus at the facility. Systech's program includes elements such as:\r\n\r\n(1) Process Hazard Analysis - Systech performs and maintains up to date, systematic and thorough studies of our operations to identify what could go wrong, identifies means of eliminating or reducing design or procedural weaknesses, and implements improvements.\r\n\r\n(2) Process Design - Systech's processes and equipment are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices. Designs include, as appropriate, emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, and ventilation systems. Systech's storage vessels, which contain the greatest inventories of chemicals, are contained in concrete catch basins (dikes) that would confine any waste spills. \r\n\r\n(3) Training - our operations and maintenance personnel are trained thoroughly on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment. They also receive refresher training. Systech's procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices, and emergency response, are fully documented and maintained up to date in light of any changes at the site.\r\n\r\n(4) Mechanical Integrity - Each item of equipment at the site that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\r\n\r\n(5) Management of Cha"

No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\r\n\r\nOur RM Program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals we handle. For example, our operating, maintenance, safe work, and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the chemicals being handled. Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures, including release detection devices. \r\n\r\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe have had no new events that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year accident history.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe have in place a written emergency contingency plan that we coordinate with the Wilson County Sheriff's Department, the Fredonia Fire Department, and the Fredonia Regional Hospital Ambulance Service. New personnel are trained on the plan, we conduct refresher training annually, and we train on any significant revisions to the plan. The plan is in compliance with RMP requirements, as well as with EPA RCRA requirements.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOur safety program is ongoing, involving the identification and implementation of numerous means of incremental safety performance."

      "SummaryText": "THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nSystech Environmental Corporation is located in Wilson County, Kansas. This facility receives and processes flammable industrial waste into a fuel that is used cement plants. Systech pioneered the process by which the energy value of wastes is recovered, thus not only providing an inexpensive source of energy, but also consuming waste that would otherwise present a disposal problem. Systech is located on an 11-acre tract of land in a rural setting about 2 miles south of the center of the City of Fredonia.\r\n\r\nSystech began operation in Fredonia in 1982. Today there are 44 employees. Systech also supports the community by buying about $2,600,000 annually in supplies, services, and utilities.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan is being submitted predictively in anticipation of the possibility of receiving RMP-listed chemicals in future. Systech has identified three RMP-listed toxics - acrylonitrile, chloroform, and vinyl acetate, and eleven RMP-listed flammables - ethyl ether, isopentane, pentane, butane, 1,3-butadiene, methyl formate, and five isomers of butene. Generally, these chemicals would be received as components of waste mixtures which would greatly reduce any hazards they may present in the pure form. Many of the activities and programs recently required by the RMP Rule have been in place at our plant since the beginning of the fuels program.
