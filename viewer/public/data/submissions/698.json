The Facility Policy\n      The owners, management, and employees of Zenith Coop Grain Co. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n      - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n      - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production \n         nutrients.\n      - The maximum quantity stored would be 476,000 pounds in our two storage tanks (one-26,000 gallon \n        and one-30,000 gallon tank).  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanker truck  \n        holding 42,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n      a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank \n           released as gas over a 10-minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,000 \n           pounds, which represents the volume of the larger storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by \n           design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.41 miles.\n\n      b. The alternative release scenario (based on the most likely potential incident) is a release from a \n          break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .83 \n          miles.           \n                                                                                                                                                                 \n4.

Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n      - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n      - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property \n        damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n     The facility has:\n        a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n        b. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know \n            information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n        d. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, \n            including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
