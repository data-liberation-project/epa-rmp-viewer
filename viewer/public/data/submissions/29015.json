              "Description": " The Columbus plant has a single, closed-loop ammonia system.  The ammonia system is used to cool water to 33 to 40 degrees (F).  The frigid water is circulated throughout the plant to cool various processes and storage tanks.  At no time does the ammonia come in contact with the water.  All of the ammonia handling equipment is located in the site's Energy Center.\n\n   The system is comprised of 37,000 pounds of ammonia, two ammonia compressors, four chill plates (heat exchangers), three condensers, one high pressure receiver, one low pressure receiver, control systems, relief vents, safety equipment (such as leak detection and ammonia monitors) and associated piping.  The compressors are differently sized for efficient energy use.  The smaller is rated at 270 tons of cooling, the larger is 435 tons.  A ton of cooling power equals 12,000 Btu/hour.  Residential air conditioners are generally in the three to five ton range.  Operation of the system is monitored and controlled 24 hrs per day, 365 days per year from the Energy Center Control Room.\n\n   The ammonia side of the process acts as two systems. On the low pressure side, liquid ammonia is pumped from the Low Pressure Receiver through the chill plates while water is circulated over the outside of the chill plates.  The liquid ammonia absorbs energy from the water through the chill plates and is turned into a low pressure gas.  The water temperature is reduced from the loss of energy.  This water is circulated throughout the plant for cooling.  The set pressure of the ammonia in the chill plate determines the temperature of the water leaving the chill plate.  Chill plates can be added or subtracted depending on the cooling load.  The low pressure gas is then returned to the low pressure receiver.\n\n   The second side uses the ammonia compressors to turn the ammonia vapor back into a liquid. The low pressure gas is drawn from the top of the low pressure receiver into the ammonia compressors and is compressed into a high pressure gas. The high pressure gas then travels through the ammonia condensers. The condensers use fans and water circulated over ammonia-containing pipes to remove the heat from the ammonia and return it to a liquid. The liquid then drains by gravity into the high pressure receiver.  The liquid stored in the high pressure receiver is used to maintain the proper liquid level in the low pressure receiver.\n\n   The compressors are located in adjacent rooms, each having an exhaust fan.  Both fans normally run in low speed at all times.  The fans are regularly tested through our Preventive Maintenance (PM) system to assure that they continue to work properly. Each compressor room has two ammonia detectors which are tied into the monitoring system. One detector is set at 50 ppm and the other at 100 ppm.  If a level of 50 ppm of ammonia is detected, an alarm sounds in the control room.  If a level of 100 ppm is detected, an alarm sounds in the control room and both exhaust fans will switch to high speed.  The fans are programmed such that in the event of a leak in either room, both exhaust fans switch to high speed.  \n\n   All safety valves are piped into a common relief piping system that has both a rupture disk and an ammonia detector in the piping at the discharge point. The detector is tied into our computer monitoring system and will sound if a reading of 50 ppm is detected. All safety valves are replaced every five years.  Safety valves allow the system to relieve over-pressurization in a controlled manner, avoiding a catastrophic failure. \n\n   Each piece of ammonia equipment is on the Preventative Maintenance program. The PMs are generated automatically at the designed frequency from a computer database. In addition to the PM system, each year during the plant shutdown, a certified ammonia contractor performs a complete inspection of each compressor.  The certified contractors also check several other pieces of ammonia equipment such as alarms and control systems.\n\n   Each valve is numbered to correspond to our process and instrumentation drawings (P&IDs) for the ammonia system. All difficult to reach hand valves have been equipped with chain operation for ease of operation and faster response in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n   All energy center employees are certified Hazardous Materials Technicians per Federal OSHA requirements, found at 49 CFR 1910.120(q).  Each Energy Center employee receives annual refresher training, as required.  Additionally, each employee receives a number of required safety training courses such as: Lock Out/Tag Out, Confined Space Entry, Hazard Communication, Compressed Gas handling, Safety Awareness, Area Safety Rules, PSM Video, PSM Ammonia Work Permit and PSM Operating Procedures Review.  The result is a highly trained work force that is extremely familiar with the ammonia system and able to respond to any contingency.\n\n   The site also has an Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site which is staffed on each of the three shifts.  ERT members are also trained to OSHA's \"Hazardous Materials Technician\" level.  These ERT members are first responders for any site emergency and are specifically trained to assist Energy Center Personnel with any situation that may arise. \n\n   A \"What If\" analysis was performed on the ammonia system in 1995.  Each piece of equipment and piping was reviewed during this analysis. In 1999, a process hazard analysis was performed on the system. These analyses will continue to be performed to identify potential risks and establish corrective actions.  The ammonia system is also governed by a \"management of change\" program that ensures that any changes to the system will be subjected to thorough engineering and safety reviews.  The goal of these analyses is to ensure continued safe operation  and prevent failures anywhere in the system.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ammonia System Personnel Safety Controls Overview\n\n  At various key locations in and around the system, devices monitor system function and operation. Key areas monitored are:\n?Ammonia Compressor Room 1\n?Ammonia Compressor Room 2\n?Ammonia Compressor Room Exhaust Fans operation\n?Ammonia Compressor Room Dampers\n?Frigid Water Chill Plates\n?Ammonia Piping System Vent stack\n\n  Several levels of alarm indication are used to keep personnel informed of current conditions in the Ammonia System.  There are several means of alarm acknowledgment, reset and operator control available. Ammonia Compressor Room 1 is equipped with:\n?Low level ammonia detector\n?High level ammonia detector\n?Local alarm buzzer indicating ammonia detected\n?Local alarm buzzer reset button\n?Exhaust fan\n?Red Strobe Light at the south entrance door\n\n  Ammonia Compressor Room 2 is equipped with:\n?One Low level ammonia detector\n?One High level ammonia detector\n?One Manning ammonia detector\n?Local alarm horn indicating ammonia detected\n?Local alarm horn reset button\n?Exhaust fan\n?Fresh air inlet dampers\n?Red Strobe Lights at the south and west entrance doors\n                                                                                                    Ammonia Exhaust Fan Operation:\n  The Ammonia Exhaust fans work in conjunction with the dampers to provide fresh air exchange throughout both Ammonia Compressor rooms. The dampers are mounted in the Ammonia Compressor room 2 area. The fan operates at either low or high speed, depending on conditions in either of the two Ammonia Compressor Rooms.                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nDampers:\n  There are 4 automatic damper units located in Ammonia Compressor Room 2 and are controlled via hard wiring from Ammonia Compressor Room 2 Exhaust Fan. When Ammonia Compressor Room 2 Exhaust Fan is running in Low Speed (no ammonia detected), these will open automatically to provide air intake. Ammonia detection in either Ammonia Compressor Room will cause dampers to close.\n\nVent Stack:\n  The vent stack is monitored for ammonia detection. Low Level Ammonia Detection (1-50 PPM).\n\nAdditional Operator Controls:\n  There is an Ammonia Exhaust Fan ?Low speed/High speed? key located at the Ammonia Compressor Room 2s? west entrance. Putting this switch in the ?High Speed? position allows the operator to place both Ammonia Exhaust fans in high speed.  There is a maintained stop button located at Ammonia Compressor Room 2s? west entrance. Pushing this button closes SV55-64, shutting off liquid ammonia flow from the High Pressure Receiver to the Low Pressure Receiver. E-stops for both Ammonia Compressors are also located in the Boiler Operator Control Room.",

All safety valves are replaced every five years.\n\nA \"worst-case scenario\" using conditions predefined by U.S. EPA requires dispersion modeling to reflect all of the following assumptions: all control devices fail; the Energy Center building collapses; the entire contents of the ammonia system are released into the environment in ten minutes; and atmospheric conditions are selected that minimize downwind mixing.  It is Abbott's strong contention that equipment design, rarely opening the system to add or remove ammonia, frequent inspection and maintenance, and high level of training provided to site personnel make the actual probability of a \"worst case\" release an extremely remote occurrence.\n\nThe results of the worst-case scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Depending on wind direction, a long narrow plume could reach one or more of the following potential receptors: residences, schools, recreational areas, industrial and office areas, a hospital or a correctional facility.  Modeling and results are summarized in Section 2.  The modeling software used was Degadis+ 2.1.\n\n(Modified on September 22, 2003) Per instructions from Ohio EPA (5/20/02 letter from Kimberly Joseph, DAPC, RMP), a higher probability ?alternate release scenario? was modeled.  The new scenario involved the activation of a relief valve due to over pressurization of the high-pressure receiver.  The relief valve is designed to allow a maximum flow of 146 lb/min.  \n\nALOHA ? 5.2 was used to model the new alternate release scenario.  The model was run using a 60-minute release duration.  The emergency relief vent discharges 78 feet above the surface.  The model did not result in any "

Additional modeling was recommended.\n\nThe pressure relief piping leaves from the top of the high-pressure receiver.  The geometry of the high-pressure receiver tank (cylindrical, horizontal tank) and discharge piping was the basis of another ALOHA ? model.  This second model also assumed a 60-minute discharge.  This model determined that the ammonia escaped from the tank as a gas.\n\nBased on these models, Abbott believes that this new alternate release scenario will not result in a ground level impact above 200 ppm of ammonia.
