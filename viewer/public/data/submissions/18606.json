Melrose facility is a 118,992 ft2 processing facility consisting of the slaughter, deboning, packaging and shipping of turkey, and is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the temperature for turkey processing and packaging.  The entire system contains approximately 45,000 pounds (i.e., 8,460 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver that operates between 140 and 195 psig and can contain as much as 20,800 pounds of liquid ammonia, assuming a 90 percent fill volume.  However, during typical operation, the vessel holds only 8,300 pounds.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers and some piping are located outdoors.\n\n1.2\tProcess Description\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Melrose facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The low side (i.e., low pressure) is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side (i.e., high pressure) is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves (SRVs), engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  SRVs protect the compressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, accumulators, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with over-pressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level float"

This guidance document used the SACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup tables that relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint distance.\n\n2.1\tWorst-case Release\n\nThe worst-case release is considered to be defined by the catastrophic rupture and complete loss of the contents of the largest vessel and associated piping (approximately 20,800 pounds of ammonia) over a 10-minute period.  Using the specified worst-case meteorology contained in the Model Plan and assuming the facility is located in a rural area, the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case release was estimated to be 14,250 feet or 2.7 miles.  \n\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it should be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and operation of the high pressure receiver is such that catastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and constructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was certified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors (National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the vessel's condition occurs every three years by a Hartford Steam Boiler and Insurance Company's inspector who has been certified by the National Board.\n\nThe vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., maximum allowable working pressure) of"

      "SummaryText": "250 psig and because of the safety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to approximately 1,000 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel failure.  If this were to occur, the vessel is equipped with dual safety relief valves (SRVs) set to relieve internal pressure at 250 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not occur as long as the SRVs continued to function.  Actuation of the SRVs would result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 for the alternative release scenario.  The SRVs are in line to be replaced every five years, in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidance contained in IIAR Bulletin Number 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safety Ammonia Refrigeration System, to ensure that they will function properly when required.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following additional reasons:\n\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the ongoing integrity of the vessels;\n* The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel;\n* The facility has emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases;\n* Main ammonia shut-offs have been labeled to allow personnel to stop the flow of ammonia quickly in an emergency.\n* Vehicular traffic in the area of the high pressure receiver is limited to only a few times a year.\n\n2.2\tAlternative-Case Release\n\nThe alternative scenario is considered to be defined by a release of ammonia that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, and reaches an endpoint offsite.  \n\nThe Model Plan scenario was used for this analysis, which assumes a release of ammonia through a 1/4-inch effective diameter hole in a high side (i.e., 150 psig) pipe or vessel, releasing 91.5 pounds of ammonia per minute.

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development of an employee participation program, which includes Melrose facility employees from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.
