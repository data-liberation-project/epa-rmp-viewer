The facility also maximizes employee participation in design work, designs process components with multiple computer-controlled and local-controlled automatic safety shutdown and building emergency shutoff systems throughout the plant.  Fire fighting equipment is strategically located throughout plant.  Easily identified emergency escape routes from the units are maintained.  This facility maintains safe operation by operating a preventive maintenance program for process equipment, conducting routine mechanical integrity inspections over the life of the equipment, routinely testing emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, checking sensors as part of a preventive maintenance program, and using mandatory checklists to ensure equipment is opened for repair without creating releases.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates more than 40 chemical gas sensors, which detect leaks at low levels.  Sensors sound alarms to warn workers.  Many sensor systems are designed to automatically shut down the process area in a safe state. The process has emergency shutoff valves that can be controlled from several locations.\n\n\n\nThe facility employs trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators.  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.  Many operations are computer controlled and monitored.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch key areas and high pressure, temperature, and level alarms are used wherever required.\n\n\n\nThe facility audits its safety programs frequently.  In-plant and corporate personnel conduct process safety audits.  Plant personnel regularly conduct operations and safety inspections.  The site investigates incidents and near misses, finds root causes, and develops and implements corrective actions to prevent recurrence.",

(Arkema) Axis, Alabama plant (Axis plant) has implemented the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP or Plan) program to document steps taken to reduce accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including the following:\n\n-Introduction,\n\n-Arkema Inc. policies to protect health, environment, and safety,\n\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes,\n\n-Prevention program,\n\n-Five-year accident history, and \n\nEmergency response plan.\n\n\n\nArkema's Policies on Health, Environment and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns to Arkema for many years.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  Arkema is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner while reducing risks to human health and the environment.  This commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  Employees and contractors carry through this emphasis on safety to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement to safety.  \n\nHES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include RMP guidance that helps our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nAxis plant is located on Highway 43, approximately 7 miles north of Exit 19 on Interstate 65.

Arkema knows that this and other chemicals that we handle are hazardous and/or flammable.  We handle these chemicals with a great deal of care and respect.  \n\n\n\nThis facility is subject to Title V of the Clean Air Act.  The facility also handles chemicals that are subject to OSHA 1910.119, Process Safety Management.  In 2001, the facility applied for inclusion in the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and met the requirements to be recognized as a STAR site.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nReleases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operations, operating safely, and by auditing for safety. The facility designs for safety by \n\n-conducting hazard studies to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards, \n\n-completing hazard studies for design changes, \n\n-maximizing employee participation in design work, \n\n-designing components with multiple automatic safety shutdowns, \n\n-incorporating emergency shutoff valves into the process and transfer systems, \n\n-maintaining computer systems to facilitate process and emergency shutdowns, \n\n-designing process operations to stop process reactions quickly, \n\n-installing fire fighting equipment at strategic locations throughout the plant, and \n\n-maintaining appropriate emergency escape routes from the units.  \n\n\n\nWe maintain safe operations by operating a preventive maintenance program for tanks, equipment, and piping, conducting routine mechanical inspections to determine that metal thickness is adequate over the life of the equipment, routinely testing emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, checking sensors as part of a preventive maintenance program, and using m"
