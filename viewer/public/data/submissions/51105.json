      "SummaryText": "TECHNIC ENGINEERED POWDER DIVISION\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN \u00bf AMMONIA\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTechnic's Engineered Powders Division (Technic) manufactures metal powders for the electronics, electrical, jewelry, aerospace, medical, and dental industries.  Manufactured powders and flakes are used in a wide range of applications, including conductive adhesives, shielding, conductive inks, electrical contacts, solar cells, fuel cells, and batteries.  \n\nAs part of the metal powder manufacturing process, Technic uses aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 28%.  In the past, aqueous ammonia was stored in 55-gallon drums that were delivered to the facility as needed (at an onsite capacity up to 7,000 lbs.).  The installation of an aboveground ammonia tank eliminates the need for the drum storage, but increases the onsite ammonia storage capacity above the threshold quantity (20,000 lbs.) in 40 C.F.R. 68 for aqueous ammonia planning.  Although installation of the tank minimizes the potential for spills due to container transfer and daily use, there is an increased risk of a larger release from the tank.  This release potential is addressed in this RMP.\n\nTechnic has determined that the facility is subject to the Program Level 1 RMP requirements for the following reasons:\n\n\u00bf\tThe worst-case offsite consequence analysis demonstrates that there will be no public receptors within the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\u00bf\tTechnic has had no aqueous ammonia process-specific accidents with offsite consequences within the past five years.\n\u00bf\tTechnic has coordinated emergency response with local responders.\n\u00bf\tOSHA PSM is not applicable because the ammonia concentration is less than 44%.\n\u00bf\tTechnic\u00bfs NAICS is 331491 (SIC 33556) which is not one of the RMP-listed codes.\n\nAccident History \n\nTechnic has had no specific aqueous ammonia process-specific accidents with offsite consequences within the past five years.\n\nWorst-Case Consequence Analysis\n\nALOHA software was used in conducting the worst-case offsite c"

The following assumptions were used:\n\n\u00bf\tA maximum of 38,718 lbs of aqueous ammonia, which is the working capacity of the tank, could be released instantaneously.  Although the tank is 6,000 gallons (43,020 lbs), Technic has administrative controls in place to limit the working capacity to 90% of the total tank capacity.\n\u00bf\t28% aqueous ammonia will be used.  \n\u00bf\tThe volume of the puddle that could be formed is 703 cu. ft.  \n\u00bf\tThe entire spill would be contained by the diked area, which is constructed of stress-relieved, chemical resistant polypropylene with welded seams.  The diked area has approximately 8,491gallons capacity [(7.67 ft. x 37 ft. x 4 ft). x (7.48 gal/cu.ft)] and a 283.79 sq. ft. surface area (i.e., puddle area).\n\u00bf\tThe building surrounding the tank is designed for protection from the elements, and has a 357.79 sq. ft. floor area (9.67 ft. x 37 ft.).  Although the main doors of the building can be opened during a release, Technic has established administrative controls that require the enclosure doors to remain closed during a spill event, unless it is essential to response/cleanup.  The only remaining escape for vapors would be through the emergency vents/fan located high on the walls of the enclosure.\n\u00bf\tThe area surrounding the facility is urban.\n\u00bf\tThe wind speed was assumed to be 1.5 meters per second measured at a height of ten meters.\n\u00bf\tConsistent with OCA Guidance, it was assumed that 10% of the ammonia vapors could be released during a spill event.  \n\u00bf\tPartly cloudy conditions, with a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec from the southwest at ten meters above ground were assumed.  \n\u00bf\tThe highest daily maximum temperature and average humidity from October 2005-October 2007 was used (100\u00baF and as 65% relative humidity, respectively).  \n\nThe resulting release rate is 19.2 lbs/min, limited to a duration of one hour.

      "SummaryText": "it allow adjustments of the percentage of vapors released during a spill event.  Rather, it assumes an open air puddle release.  As such, ALOHA overestimates the vapor releases for scenarios such as the one presented at Technic.  The actual release rate and calculated distance to endpoint would be expected to be lower than that predicted using ALOHA.\n\nThe resulting estimated distances to the toxic endpoint of 0.14mg/l is 102 yards (0.058 miles).\n\nPublic and Environmental Receptors\n\nTo confirm there were no environmental or public receptors, Technic was located on a topographic map.  A circle was drawn around the ammonia tank\u00bfs planned location, with a radius equal to the distance to toxic endpoint.  There are no environmental receptors (national parks, state parks, monuments, wilderness areas, forests) or offsite public receptors (residences, institutions, industrial/commercial/office buildings, parks, recreational areas) within the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\nThe general public is not granted routine access to the site and there are no onsite locations that would be of interest as a gathering location.  For security measures, Technic employs the services of a security guard at the reception area and does not allow unaccompanied visitors at the site.  The area surrounding the manufacturing building and parking areas is mostly vegetated.  Park East Drive is south-southwest of Technic\u00bfs main parking area.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nTechnic has developed a relationship with local emergency planning personnel to ensure that the facility is adequately prepared in the event of a release.  The Woonsocket Fire Department serves as the LEPC, and has been made familiar with the ammonia process at the site.  In addition, Technic has regularly reported ammonia storage on its Tier 2 reports, as required by regulation.\n\nTechnic has the following plans and programs in place at the facility:\n\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan \u00bf Addresses coordination with agencies, emergency recognition and"
