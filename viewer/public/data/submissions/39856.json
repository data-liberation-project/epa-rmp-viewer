      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary Packerland Packing, Plainwell\n\nThe Facility:\n\nPackerland Packing Company (PPC) is a beef processing facility located south of the City of Plainwell, in Allegan County, Michigan. The Company is a subsidiary of Smithfield Beef Group. PPC performs cattle slaughter and fabrication in its facility and employs approximately 1150 west-Michigan residents.\n\nChemical Safety, Release Prevention and Emergency Response:\n\nPPC takes seriously its role as a good corporate citizen and neighbor, by controlling its processes and the chemicals used or generated in those processes. The company has worked extensively with technical consultants, state and local agencies and in-house experts to develop programs that promote a safe working environment, the health and welfare of the local community, and the protection of Michigan\u00bfs natural resources. From these endeavors have come a more efficient refrigeration system, operated by trained and tested section of maintenance personnel; the Clean Water Facility is run by state certified waste water operators and an environmental management system to control the process.\n\nProcess control is the single most significant step toward release prevention. The company management has expended great energy and resources to ensure process control, such as a computerized preventive maintenance system, general awareness training for all employees, process-specific module training for effected employees and when necessary off-site training programs.\n\nPPC has factored many aspects into the operational controls of this facility but being prepared for the worst case is our primary goal. The Emergency Action Plan (EAP) as guidance for the possibility of a spill, includes proper protocol for the notification of the control group, spill control, containment and clean up by the on-site Haz-Mat team, and timely notification of out side agencies as dictated by the chemical released, weather factors and potential community areas affected by a release"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nRegulated substances:\n\nIn the course of its operations, the company handles two regulated substances, in quantities reportable under the Risk Management Plan (RMP): (1) Anhydrous Ammonia and (2) Methane;\n\n1.\tAnhydrous Ammonia:\nPPC uses a refrigeration system to keep stored product fresh until it is shipped to market. The system uses 55,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, liquefied under pressure, and piped though out the facilities cooling units similar to the refrigerator in a home, only on a larger scale.\n\nRelease Prevention Programs:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is covered within the PPC by OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management program (PSM). I PSM is a process control program. It requires a verity of checks and balances on the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system. All equipment is rated for use in the system by the IIAR an organization of refrigeration specialists that is recognized by both industry and the government. Specific procedures designed to prevent releases or catastrophic events include; Management of change, where each change in the system design or components to the system must be evaluated before, during and after installation; Process Hazard Analysis, consisting of \u00bfwhat if\u00bf questions relating to equipment failures and the response to those failures; Training, for both line employees and supervisors to ensure continuity in process management and ability to address system failures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nWe have experienced several minor \u00bfhot gas\u00bf ammonia leaks in the past five years. They are termed \u00bfhot gas\u00bf because thy are most often the result of a worm seal or packing nut allowing trace amounts of ammonia vapor to escape from the system. These releases have occurred both indoors and on the roof in the distribution system and have only required short-term departmental evacuations. Several pressure relief valves have failed over the last five years; they have been the largest releases of ammonia. The worst of these was on April 16, 2004 3:05 am,"

      "SummaryText": "when a relief valve on the roof failed, and releasing an estimated 88 pounds of ammonia into the atmosphere. The entire incident duration was 45 minutes, all proper procedures where followed as per the PSM and EAP. Another incident occurred when a shell and tube heat exchanger ruptured releasing an unknown quantity of ammonia into the hide chill water system, this water was released to the on-site Clean Water Treatment facility. The water was treated biologically for ammonia removal prior to environmental release within the parameters of our NPDES permit.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facilities Process Safety Management program controls general response measures. Under PSM and the facilities EAP, several concurrent activities will occur upon notification of a release with potential to migrate off site, they include mobilization of the on-site Haz-Mat team members and the Control Group will initiate the command structure. Then notification of the local fire department, LEPC and community police authorities, state and federal authorities.\n\nPPC has in-house response personnel trained in advanced Haz-Mat operations. In case of a catastrophic release it would not be outside the facilities capability to have control and containment in place prior to the arrival of the Kalamazoo fire Company Haz-Mat team. \n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvement:\n\nWith improved resources, PPC has developed more comprehensive response programs like the EAP and developed a Haz-Mat team to deal with catastrophic releases. Evolution of the EAP and continuous Haz-Mat training has improved to eliminate the need to rely on outside Haz-Mat response groups but work side by side with them. \n\n2.\tMethane:\n\nMethane is a natural by-product resulting from biological processes used by PPC to reduce BOD levels in the anaerobic lagoon treatment system. The gas is captured under a specially designed lagoon cover. Approximately 33,000 pounds of methane can be accumulated under the cover. The methane gas"

The lagoon and its flare require visual inspection, which is preformed on a daily basis. The operation is inspected to ensure that the flare is activated and operating when in use or the blower to the boiler burner tip is functioning and that the lagoon cover seams are intact. The cover acts as a release preventative should the flare and burner tip blower is not I operation. Breaks in the lagoon cover are noted and an on-site maintenance staff is utilized to make the necessary repairs.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWe have experienced periodic, minute releases of methane over the last five years because of occasional breaks in the cover seams. No injuries or other adverse affects resulted from those incidents. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDue to the nature of the process and the limited possibilities for the type of emergency, response is limited principally to preventive measures. Leaks are repaired as they occur. Should a catastrophic explosion or fire occur, it would self extinguish within seconds. In the aftermath of an explosion, Clean Water personnel would follow the facilities EAP, several concurrent activities will occur upon notification of a release, to  include mobilization of the on-site Haz-Mat team members and the Control Group will initiate the command structure. Then notification of the local fire department, LEPC and community police authorities, state and federal authorities and damage assessments would be made within the blast zone.\n\nPotential casualties should primarily be limited to persons in the immediate vicinity of the lagoon or inside buildings within the 0.3 miles of the center of the blast.\n\nPlanned Chang"

The simplicity of the process, the minimal technology used to maintain the system, and the continuous depletion of the potential hazard makes this a very rudimentary process."
