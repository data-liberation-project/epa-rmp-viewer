OUR FARMERS OWNERS, MANAGERS, AND EMPLOYEES HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PLAN THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THIS COMPANY IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAIL BUSINESS THAT SPECIALIZES IN GRAIN STORAGE FOR AREA PRODUCERS AS WELL AS PROVIDING THE NECESSARY INPUTS FOR GRAIN PRODUCTION.\n\nOUR PLANT CONSISTS OF TWO 18,000 GALLON ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS, WHEN FILLED TO 85% CAPACITY, WILL HOLD APPROXIMATELY 158,000 POUNDS.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE 13 NURSE TRAILERS THAT WILL HOLD 4,000 POUNDS EACH, ADDING ANOTHER 52,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS.  THIS MAKES A TOTAL OF 210,000 POUNDS AT THE ASHLAND FACILITY.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO MAY POTENTIALLY RELEASE 132,000 POUNDS (OVER A TEN MINUTE PERIOD) AND HAS A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 2.50 MILES.  THIS RELEASE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 975 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A RELEASE OF 11,908 POUNDS OVER A TWO-MINUTE RELEASE PERIOD.  THIS RELEASE WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENPOINT OF .83 MILES AND WOULD AFFECT 100 PEOPLE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.\n\nTHIS COMPANY MAINTAINS AND OPERATES THEIR NH3 PLANT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH ALL FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUT PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT.  OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN SAFETY PROCEDURES, PROPER PLANT OPERATION, PLANT MAINTENANCE AND THE EMPLOYEES ARE COMPETENCY TESTED OVER THE TRAINING MATERIAL.  EACH EMPLOYEE USES GOGGLES AND GLOVES DURING AMMONIA OPERATIONS AS WELL AS ALWAYS PROVIDING PLENTY OF SAFETY WATER DURING NURSE TANK LOADING OPERATIONS.\n\nWITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRAINING IN MIND, IT MAKES IT VERY SIMPLE TO REPORT TO YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS TO EMPLOYEES, THE SURROUNDING PUBLIC, AND THE AREA FIRS"
