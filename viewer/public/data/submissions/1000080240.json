Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one RMP regulated refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating meat products. \n\n\n\nAn aerial map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A. \n\n\n\nIV.    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\nV.    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternate scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. An audit of the PSM program was conducted in March of 2018 and the next audit take place on, or before, March 12, 2021 in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.

Employee Participation - OSI has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.  In addition, the employee participation program ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  Employees at OSI have assisted in developing the initial PHA and have assisted in revalidating the PHA every five years. In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other PSM/RMP information such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures and management of change.\n\n?    Process Safety Information - OSI has developed a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed during the April, 2018 PHA revalidation study.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - OSI has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough    to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program has been established to ensure PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and to ensure findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. The last PHA revalidation was completed on April 26, 2018.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - OSI has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate. The Standard Operating Procedures were last revie"
