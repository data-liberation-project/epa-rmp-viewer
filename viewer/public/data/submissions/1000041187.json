The worst case release scenario assumes that several highly unlikely events occur simultaneously such as:\r\n\r\nCatastrophic failure of aerosol within a case\r\n\tFailure of all automated safety and alarm systems\r\n\tFailure of trained operators to respond appropriately\r\n        \tThe event occurs during least likely stagnant meteorologically condition\r\n\r\nThe USEPA developed guidance (Risk Management Program Guidance for Warehouses) was used to complete the modeling of the worst case release scenario.  The modeling shows that the distance to endpoint would be 0.01 miles and therefore there would be no impact on the surrounding community.  Therefore, the Harrisonville Distribution Center is defined as a Program 1 facility.  A Program one facility, as defined by the USEPA, presents a minimal risk to the community.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. has developed programs to comply with the required environmental health and safety standards.\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals through process management systems and programs which include:\r\n\r\n\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\tPre-Start up review\r\n\tProcess hazard analysis\r\n\tCompliance audits\r\n\tOperating procedures\r\n\tAccident investigations\r\n\tTraining\r\n\tEmployee participation\r\n\tMechanical integrity\r\n\tHot work permit\r\n\tManagement of change\r\n\tContractor safety\r\n\r\nIn addition to our management programs, specially designed to control, prevent, detect and mitigate potential accidental releases are also in place.  These include an early suppression, fast response sprinkler system installed throughout the warehouse.  Aerosol storage racks are equipped with ESFR in-rack sprinkler system.  All of our forklift operators are trained and certified.  Our firewater sprinter systems are inspected annually by an outside independent company.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. strives for continuous improvement in its safety program.

We encourage employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment including forklift trucks.  Our systems and programs are routinely audited, typically by an outside company or insurance carrier to evaluate their effectiveness.  Hand held dry fire extinguishers meet local code.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\r\n\r\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. has an emergency response plan detailing procedures to respond to accidental releases and other emergencies.  Our plan is tested on a regular basis through exercises and drills.  Our plan has been shared with Cass County fire department and the Cass County LEPC.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency affecting the local community, Church & Dwight Co., Inc. will work closely with local, county and state agencies to help ensure public safety.  These agencies take the lead in informing the public on appropriate actions in the event of an emergency."

      "SummaryText": "Background\r\n\r\nChurch & Dwight Co., Inc. is engaged in the manufacturing in the manufacture and sale of a diversified line of consumer and health products.  Operations at the Harrisonville distribution center began in June of 2001.  The Harrisonville plant consist of administration offices, warehouse storages, manufacturing area and shipping areas.  The facility warehouses and distributes regulated products but does not manufacture them.\r\n\r\nThe Harrisonville distribution buildings include 540,000 square feet of warehouse storage capacity.  The manufacturing building is 150,000 square feet.  The Harrisonville plant operates seven days a week, 24 hours per day, and employs approximately 300 people.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\nThe operations affected by the risk management plan (RMP) involve the receipt and storage of aerosol product in consumer  containers.  Product is moved within the warehouse via forklift trucks.\r\n\r\nVarious hydrocarbons are used as propellants in the aerosol product.  They hydrocarbons are defined by the environmental protection agency (USEPA) as hazardous materials.  The USEPA enforces regulations designed to minimize the potential for an accidental release associated with handling materials.  Additionally, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforce accident prevention regulations to protect employees.  The aerosol product propellants are listed as hazardous due to flammability.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Harrisonville, MO plant has no history of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\n\r\nThe USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as worst and alternate case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is defined as the sudden loss of containment of material in the largest tank, vessel or container.  The worst case scenario assumes the sudden release of aerosol from a case of consumer packaged products.  The alternate release scenario also assumes the release of aerosol from consumer pack"
