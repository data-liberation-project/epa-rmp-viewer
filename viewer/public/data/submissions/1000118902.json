The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Ephrata Borough Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0\tDescription of The Ephrata Borough Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ephrata Borough Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1-ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the treated water prior to release to the receiving stream.\n\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The Ephrata Borough Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe Ephrata Borough Wastewater Treatment Plant # 1 completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies.
