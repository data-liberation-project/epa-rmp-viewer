Otto & Sons utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration.  Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze the produced product and maintain the facility's temperature.  Otto & Sons has a total of 29,400 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite.  One closed loop system for product freezing contains 15,700 pounds and the other closed loop system for maintaining plant temperature contains 13,700 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nOtto & Sons management is committed to safety and the implementation of safe ammonia refrigeration practices.  Employee training has been conducted in accordance to OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.In addition, Otto & Sons conducts annual retraining for all emergency response team members which includes evacuation and emergency response drills.  Otto & Sons has also established awareness training with the West Chicago Fire Department.  Otto & Sons has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia since it has been stored onsite in 1994.  \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the rupture of the HP Receiver.  The manufacturer has calculated that no more than 6227 pounds of anhydrous ammonia could be released.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the offsite endpoint distance of the 0.9 miles.  An alternative release scenario would be lifting a relief valve on the Condenser.  RMP*Comp was used to determine the endpoint distance of the 0.1 miles.  Landview Software was used to calculate the census data.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nNone\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nOtto & Sons complies with OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.119 (process safety management-PSM).  The PSM program minimizes the potential of an unwanted anhydrous ammonia release.  Also, the program "

The PSM program consists of the following elements.  \nEmployee Participation: All employees participate in ammonia awareness training and have access to the process safety management program.  Otto & Sons consults with employees concerning the development of the PSM program.\nProcess Safety Information: Information has been compiled about the ammonia refrigeration system.  The information includes MSDS, detailed drawings and descriptions of the ammonia system equipment.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): A team of Otto & Sons employees and an outside refrigeration consultant has developed a PHA for each ammonia system.  The PHA identified potential hazards and recommended improvements to safely operate the ammonia system.\nOperating Procedures: Standard and emergency operating procedures were developed to safely operate the ammonia system.\nTraining:  A training program has been developed to ensure all employees are properly trained in their related duties with the ammonia system.\nContractors:  Guidelines were established to qualify any contractor allowed to work on the ammonia system.\nPrestart-Up Safety Review: A prestart-up safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed.\nMechanical Integrity: Procedures have been developed to inspect and maintain the ammonia system equipment on a frequent basis.  An outside contractor assists with preventative maintenance on a weekly basis.\nManagement of Change: Any modifications to the ammonia system are reviewed in detail to ensure there is no detrimental impact on the ammonia system.\nIncident Investigation: Procedures ascertain that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.  Any recommendations are implemented to improve the safety of the ammonia system\nCompliance Aud"

      "SummaryText": "its: Audits will be conducted at least every three years as mandated by OHSA 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nOtto & Sons has developed an emergency response plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant personnel and the public.  The plan also outlines procedures for mitigating and neutralizing the affected area.  In the event of a serious release, the plan has written instructions for notifying and coordinating emergency response efforts with the West Chicago Fire Department and the DuPage County Emergency Planning Committee.  Otto & Sons has established an in-house emergency response team, as well as an outside contracted emergency response team, to quickly respond any unwanted releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Each member of the emergency response team has had 24-hour ammonia emergency response training as well as an annual 8-hour refresher course per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120.  The emergency response plan has specific written instructions for each team member's role during and following an emergency.  Refrigeration operators have been trained to safely shut down refrigeration equipment during an emergency.  Each year an emergency response practice drill is performed at Otto & Sons.  Recommendations from each emergency response drill are incorporated into the emergency response program for continuous improvement.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nOtto & Sons is committed to continuous training on the ammonia refrigeration system.  Otto & Sons will continually incorporate new technology to improve the operation of the ammonia system.  The constant preventive maintenance and inspections will allow Otto & Sons to continue to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system."
