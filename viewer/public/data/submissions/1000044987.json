The facility operates two production shifts and a maintenance/cleaning crew on third shift.  The 750,000 sq ft plant is on a 59 acre plot and is refrigerated with a 210,000 pound anhydrous ammonia system.  This state of the art system is operated 24/7 by experienced, licensed refrigeration management and operators. \r\n\r\nOver one half of the plant is protected by an automatic sprinkler system where flammables and combusible materials are either used or stored.  The balance of the facility is of concrete and metal construction. Triumph Foods' fire protection system includes pull stations, smoke & heat detection, and sprinkler flow alarms. All are monitored by a remote off site alarm company 24/7 as well as the on site security personnel.  The plant is always staffed by refrigeration and security personnel.  \r\n\r\nEmergency declaration is done via radio and/or telephone to designated Emergency Coordinators, who will then direct activation of the plant alarm system which utilizes a combinations strobes/ chimes/ air horns to alert employees of the type of hazards. \r\n\r\nThe plant has a Plant Emergency Response Team of made up of refrigeration and maintenance personnel as well as a HAZMAT Response Truck for response to any chemical spills or releases beyond the normal scope of work.   Plant Emergency Response Team members are trained to a 24Hr HAZWOPER Technician level and some management members are trained to 40Hr HAZWOPER and Incident Commander.   \r\n\r\nTriumph Foods does not have a Fire Brigade on site, but the Saint Joseph Fire Department's Station #2 is within one-half mile from the plant, and Station #1 is within three miles. \r\n\r\nThe plant has a Waste Water Pre-Treatment Plant to treat the plant's process water to permit specifications prior to discharging to the St Josep"

There is a valve located at the outfall to isolate storm water discharge. \r\n\r\nAll employees are trained per OSHA, EPA regulations and other mandated industrial standards, including Hazards Communications which instructs employees on the particular hazards and proper handling of the cleaning and sanitizing chemicals used in the plant.  Particular emphasis is placed on the reporting of spills and releases or any other unusual events.\r\n\r\nTriumph Foods has written emergency action and response plans which identify potential emergencies and the steps to be taken to safetly remove all employees from harms way in the event incidents should arise.  A Health Services Department is staffed by nurses on both production shifts.\r\n\r\nThe plants Emergency Action and Response Plans are shared with the Saint Joseph Fire Department, Northwest Missouri Region H Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the St. Joseph/ Buchanan Co. Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Triumph Foods will host any emergency response agency wishing to tour the facility and will schedule joint response drills periodically.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\n\r\nTriumph Foods has not had any significant ammonia related accidents in the last five years of operation.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nContinued training as listed above, plus cooperative efforts with local and regional ERS."
