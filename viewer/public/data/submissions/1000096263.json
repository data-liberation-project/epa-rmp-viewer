We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Jackson Terminal located in Jackson County, Minnesota, is owned and operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe Jackson Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane. The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in nine above ground storage tanks. The tanks are equipped with automatic level indicators and alarms and automatic inlet propane shutoff valves to allow for unattended filling from a remote pipeline control facility. Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the tank filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection. The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesa"

The trace odorant remains present in the propane when it is loaded into the transport trucks. \n\n\n\nThe process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nThe only listed flammable substance which is present above the threshold quantities at the Jackson Terminal is propane.  Ethyl mercaptan used as an odorant is also stored at the facility below the RMP threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Jackson Terminal.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Jackson Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n\n* Atmospheric relief devices \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nJackson Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency pro"

The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Jackson Terminal is coordinated with the Jackson County Fire Department.  The Jackson Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with the Jackson County Fire Department, which provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to providing information on the emergency plan to the fire department, the Jackson Terminal conducts periodic site orientations that involve the emergency responders, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal. The Jackson Emergency Planning Committee is also aware of the terminal's location, operations and emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Jackson Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Jackson Terminal.\n\n\n\n* Asphalt paving of the entrance drive to reduce ice build up in winter."
