A total of 15 full LHY trailers are assumed to be stored on site.  \r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the basic prevention plan a formal HAZOP was performed considering hazards such as fire, explosion, runaway reactions, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, process contamination, equipment failure, loss of cooling, heating, electrical, power, and instrument air.\r\n\r\n4.  Five year accident history:\r\nThis is a new site and there have been not accidents involving or accidental releases of hydrogen that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the past five years.\r\n\r\n5. The emergency response program:  \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is based upon OHSA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees have also been coordinated with the City of LaPorte Fire and Emergency for emergencies related to the hydrogen process.  Periodic review are requested with the fire department to evaluate the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  The Site Emergency Procedure plan is reviewed and updated annually.  Refresher training for site personnel is conducted annually.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some"

Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) Inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  \r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described where selected based on criteria established in the regulation.  \r\n\r\n2.  The stationary sources and regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Primary purpose of this facility is to liquefy hydrogen for transport to our customers via trailers.  \r\n\r\nLiquid hydrogen is produced from hydrogen gas taken from the H2 pipeline.  Liquid hydrogen is produced by putting hydrogen gas through a series of compression, cooling and expansion steps.  The liquid hydrogen is stored in four 120,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tanks.  Liquid hydrogen is loaded into highway tankers and shipped to various off-site customers.  Liquid hydrogen stored on site is pure hydrogen.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is hydrogen.  \r\n\r\nThe Site stores liquid hydrogen"
