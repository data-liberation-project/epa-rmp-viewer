(SKC) / Mani Can Corporation accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The SKC emergency response policy is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements. SKC use ammonia, an EPA regulated substance, in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used in the plant as a refrigerant agent in the freezer and air conditioning system. The process includes a compressor room, condensers, evaporators, heat exchanger, receivers, valves and various safety equipment. The freezers are used to store tuna fish. The two systems, freezers and air conditioning, are interconnected with a capacity approximately of 16,000 pounds of refrigerant.\nThe offsite consequence analysis take into considerations the two ammonia release scenarios (worst case and alternative). The first scenario for ammonia is defined by EPA, which states the maximum quantity in the largest vessel (in this case 16,000 pounds) is released over 10 minutes. EPA selects the worst case for propane like a vapor cloud explosion.  The alternate case for both substances is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. \nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint selected by EPA of 14 mg/L.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint to estimate the population potentially affected.  \nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia process involves the failure of the two high-pressure receivers with a total of 16,000 pounds of propane. Affecting a radius of 2.3 miles. The population within this radius is approximately 40,000 persons. \nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia process involves the failure of a valve in the compressor's room with an amount of 350 pounds, a"

EPA mandated meteorological conditions were used for both scenarios .The SKC accidental release program is based on the following elements:\n7 Training of the operators\n7 Preventive maintenance program\n7 Operating process and use of safety equipment\n7 Hazard review\nThe ammonia process of SKC has an incident in 1998 with a release of 50 pounds and no onsite and offsite incidents.\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been evaluated by the Fire Department and Civil Defense Department. This program include:\n1. An emergency response plan, maintained at the stationary source and containing procedures for informing the local emergency response agencies about accidental release.\n2. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for inspection testing and maintenance.\n3. Training in relevant procedures for all employees involved in the propane and refrigeration process\n\n\nSKC handle 200,000 pounds of propane and had already developed the Rmp, but not data is submitted with this report until further notice by EPA."
