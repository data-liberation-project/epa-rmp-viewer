The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receiver\n\nThe purpose of the high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receiver contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator.

The glycol chiller oil pot is equipped with a spring-return oil drain valve which is used to drain oil from the system as needed. Under normal conditions, the glycol chiller oil pot contains low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil. The purpose of the oil separator oil pot is to provide a means of returning oil to the compressors. The oil separator oil pot receives oil and high pressure vapor ammonia from Oil Separator 4 and vents ammonia vapor to the main suction accumulator. Once the oil separator oil pot is full, the oil is transferred back to the compressors. Under normal conditions, the oil separator oil pot contains high pressure vapor ammonia and refrigerant oil.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporators, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessels. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nGlycol Chiller\n\nThe purpose of the glycol chiller (shell and tube heat exchanger) is to remove heat from the glycol solution being pumped through it.

The glycol chiller accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The glycol chiller accumulator supplies, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the glycol chiller. Liquid and vapor returned from the glycol chiller is separated inside the glycol chiller accumulator to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor.

The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reaches the float switches, the three way solenoid valves are energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessels to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and glycol chiller accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver/thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAuto-Purger\n\nThe purpose of the auto-purger is to remove non-condensable gases from the system without requiring the system to be manually opened.

      "SummaryText": "to-purger consists of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. The auto-purger removes non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the system. The non-condensable gases are removed from the system through the water bubbler. Under normal conditions, the auto-purger contains small quantities of ammonia and water. \n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nAmmonia Detection System\n\nThe engine room is equipped with two (2) ammonia detectors which will alert personnel if the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm through audible/visual alarms installed outside the engine room. If the concentration in the engine room reaches 150 ppm, the emergency ventilation system will be activated. Additional ammonia detectors are installed in each cold room, precool room, and in the chiller area. If the concentration in one of these rooms exceeds 10 ppm, the liquid feed solenoid valve(s) supplying the room/area is automatically closed. At 25 ppm, audible/visual alarms are activated. \n\n\n\nEmergency Control Box\n\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) is installed on the east wall of the engine room and contains three (3) valves. \n\nValve #1: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #2: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\nValve #3: High Side Discharge Valve\n\nOpening the water valve near the mixing tank and valve #1 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening the water valve and Valve #3 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system. The Emergency Control Box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations.\n\n\n\nRelief Valves\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equ"

This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n\n\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\n\nThe high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Refrigeration Switch (E-Stop)\n\nThe interior entrance to the machinery room is equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch that controls power to the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room.\n\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Titan Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Titan Cold Storage is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n    To ensure the ongoing safety of our facility, we have instituted a Process Safety Management program.  We have compiled written process safety information that includes the hazards of the process, the technology being utilized and detailed information on our equipment.  We conduct a Process Hazard Analysis every five years, ensuring to track all recommendations to closure.  All operators assist in the annual review of our operating procedures to ensure that both the SOPs are accurate, and to ensure each employee has been provided refresher training on them.  We also utilize safe work practices such as Lock-Out, Block-Out, Tag-Out, Confined Space Entry, Hot Works, Line Breaking, etcetera.\n\n    To assure Mechanical Integrity, we perform detailed inspections on each piece of equipment in the system on an annual basis.  All inspections are performed per International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Bulletin 109.  To assure the longevity of the process, we have also developed and implemented a Management of Change p"

This plan includes a chain of command, evacuation procedures, a notification list, and First Aid for exposure to either liquid or gaseous ammonia.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nTitan Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Titan Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nTitan Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are assigned a responsible person and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented. \n\n\n\nFor the future, Titan Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Titan Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Titan Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
