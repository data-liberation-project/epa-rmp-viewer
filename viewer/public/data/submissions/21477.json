(\"AmeriGas\") is the nation's largest distributor of propane in the United States, with over 600 retail locations, 300 satellite locations, and 12 terminal locations. We operate in 45 states with over 5,500 employees. We are the industry leader in gallons distributed and customers served, and we continuously strive to be the industry leader in safety innovation and practices. We constantly endeavor to improve our safety performance as it relates to our employees, our customers, the environment and the general public with whom we work. \n\nAmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. AmeriGas also has six Regional Safety Managers, an Operations Safety Manager , a Safety & Technology Manager, and a Logistics & Supply Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. Terminal locations are staffed with a Regional Logistics Manager, who has received extensive safety management training. These safety professionals are able to immediately respond to a serious incident and provide technical expertise to emergency response agencies on the scene of the incident. AmeriGas also has a 24-hours-a -day Emergency Communications Center, which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. Located in Rocklin, California, the ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location, or by AmeriGas customers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention \n\nAt this facility we store and distribute propane. The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce potential hazards to our own personal health and safety as well as our coworkers, and to reduce the potential hazard to nearby members of the community. It is our Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Fe"

Safe handling of propane is dependent upon a number of factors, including the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures, and the continuous training of our personnel.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store and distribute propane to wholesale customers and AmeriGas retail locations. Propane is primarily used by our customers as a fuel. Propane is received by transport truck and rail cars, and stored in bulk storage tanks. Propane is distributed to wholesale customers and other AmeriGas locations by bobtails, transport trucks and rail cars. This facility has specialized equipment for unloading and loading propane. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is propane. \n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 856,800 pounds. \n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\nInformation concerning the Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario for this facility are contained in the appropriate Sections of the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\nEmergency Response Plan, Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThis AmeriGas propane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). The worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have an extremely small chance of occurring. Our propane storage tanks are designed for propane and butane service and may remain in service indefinitely. Our preventative maintenance program ensures that our bulk stor"

A representative of the Columbia Fire Department visited and inspected this facility on 04/21/99.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1948 and is in compliance with NFPA-58 Standard. In the past two years, AmeriGas has invested over $150,000 in upgrades to this facility. These upgrades include:  Installation of new internal valves and remote emergency shutdown systems; significant piping and valving improvements; rail siding and tower improvements; and pump, compressor and meter upgrades and replacements. In 2000, we plan to replace the transport loading rack meter, vapor eliminator and equalization valve. All of these improvements will meet and / or exceed NFPA-58, 1998 Edition."
