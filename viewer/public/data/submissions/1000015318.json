Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Security Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained a Quick Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n1.2.          Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 2370 W. Warrior Trail, Grand Prairie, Texas. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n1.3.          Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of (15,000 lbs)[1].  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.7 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia through the pressure relief device caused by over pressurization of ammonia in the High Pressure Receiver (HPR).  The total volume of the refrigeration system \u00c2\u00bf 15,000 lbs of ammonia \u00c2\u00bf was used for the release calculations.  No administrative controls o"

The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.4 mile.\n\n1.4.     Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \n\nThis includes:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHA\u00c2\u00bfs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\n\u00c2\u00b7        Use of qualified contractors for work on the system\n\nThe detailed Ammonia System Release Prevention Program is contained in a supporting document (revised and updated July, 2010) that is maintained by the site\u00c2\u00bfs Safety Manager.\n\n1.5.          Five-year Accident History\nBetween December, 2004 (the previous revalidation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. However, the following ammonia-related incident occurred:\n\n \n\n6/11/06 \u00c2\u00bf During routine maintenance, an electrical contractor isolated"

The pressure increased to 230psig which caused three pressure relief devices (PRV\u00c2\u00bfs) to lift.  This resulted in a release of 78 lbs of ammonia, aggregate, to the atmosphere.  Plant personnel were able to immediately respond to the situation.  Corrective actions were completed and the system was placed back online within one day.\n\n1.6.     Emergency Response Program\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the site\u00c2\u00bfs Safety Manager and is reviewed annually.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \n\nThe site has an Ammonia Quick Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n\n1.7.

The method follows Chapter 4 of the EPA/CEPPO Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration dated May 2000. LandView\u00c2\u00ae6 software application was used to map the offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for the Worst-Case and Alternative Release scenarios. In addition, LandView\u00c2\u00ae6 was used for demographic information, jurisdictional entities, detailed topological features.\n\n \n\n3.3.     Release Scenarios\n3.3.1.           Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\nSince the Fresh Express ammonia refrigeration system is considered an RMP Program 3 process, the worst-case release scenario was identified as that which was estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to the toxic endpoint for ammonia.  The worst-case release quantity was defined as the greatest amount potentially held in a single vessel location (i.e., 15,000 pounds in the High Pressure Receiver). No mitigating controls were assumed.\n\nPursuant to the Environmental Protection Agency / Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office\u00c2\u00bfs (EPA/CEPPO\u00c2\u00bfs) Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the meteorological and site specific variables assumed for the analysis are as follows:\n\n \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Assumptions\n \nChemical Name:\n Anhydrous Ammonia\n \nPhysical State:\n Pressurized Liquid\n \nBasis of Results:\n RMP*Comp V 1.07\n \nScenario:\n Liquid spill vaporizes to airborne vapor and droplets\n \nQuantity Released, lbs:\n 15,000\n \nRelease Rate:\n 1,500 lbs/min (see text, this Section)\n \nRelease Duration:\n 10 minutes\n \nWind Speed:\n 1.5 meters per second\n \nAtmospheric Stability Class:\n F\n \nTopography (Surface Roughness)\n Urban\n \nToxic Endpoint Concentration:\n 0.14 mg/L (ERPG-2)\n \nDistance to Endpoint, mi:\n 0.7 mi (see text, this Section)\n \nReceptors:\n See Section Four\n \nVessel or System Considered:\n Single High Pressure Receiver\n \nVessel"

The guidance specifies the release rate as the quantity released as a gas over 10 minutes.  This rapid release of ammonia is an airborne mixture of vapor and droplets.  Since the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) is located outdoors, all the vapor and droplets are assumed to remain airborne.  The release rate is calculated as follows:\n\nQR = Q/10\n\nWhere:       QR = Release Rate (lbs/min)\n\n                 Q = Quantity Released (lbs)\n\nUsing our scenario criteria:\n\nQR = 15,000 lbs / 10 min  = 1,500 lbs/min (unmitigated)\n\nDistance to the Toxic Endpoint - Based on the estimated worst-case release rate of 1500 lbs/min, RMP*Comp V 1.07 shows the distance to the toxic endpoint at 0.7 miles from the single High Pressure Receiver.

Alternative Release Scenario Analysis\nPursuant to RMP regulations, the alternative release scenario was identified as that which is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario, and that which will reach an endpoint offsite.  The alternative release scenario used meteorological conditions more representative of the site than those used for the worst case.  \n\nThe alternative release scenarios considered both the five-year accident history and the results of the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study conducted at Fresh Express on May 6, 2010.  When these other scenarios were evaluated, the end results were no worse than the last analysis completed in December 2004. As a result, the selected Alternative Release Scenario remains unchanged.  \n\nThe scenario chosen is a lifted pressure relief device that has lifted due to the high pressure receiver exceeding 250 psig.
