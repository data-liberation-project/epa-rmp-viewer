      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary, Ormesa\r\n\r\nOrmesa LLC (The Ormesa Geothermal Projects are operated by Ormat Nevada, Inc. (Ormat), and owned by Ormesa LLC. The Ormesa Geothermal Projects are near the Cities of El Centro and Holtville, California within the East Mesa Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA).  The facilities are located east of the Highline Canal.  They generate electricity from renewable geothermal resources in an environmentally friendly manner. \r\n\r\nOrmat operates the Ormesa Geothermal Projects in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations. The Ormesa Geothermal Projects have emergency response procedures and protocols in place at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.  The Holtville Fire Department is the first responder.\r\n\r\nThe project area, defined as the stationary source under RMP, covers a large geographic area and consists of three, independent geothermal power plants and associated geothermal wells.  Each power plant is a separate process as defined under the CalARP regulation as well as the Federal EPA Risk Management Program Regulation (RMP, codified at 40CFR68), and the Federal OSHA Process Safety Management Regulation (PSM, codified at 29CFR1910.119).  \r\nOrmesa 1: Is a binary geothermal power plant consisting of two Ormat Energy Converters (OECs).  The OECs extract heat from pumped hot geothermal brine to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines and electrical generators.  The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle.  Approximately 12 megawatts of power is generated from this plant.\r\nOrmesa 2: Is a binary geothermal power plant consisting of two Ormat Energy Converters (OECs).  The OECs extract heat from pumped hot geothermal brine to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines and electrical generators.  The isopentane e"

Approximately 15 megawatts of power is generated from this plant.\r\nOrmesa 3: Is an integrated three level power plant consisting of two Ormat Energy Converters (OECs).  Like Ormesa 1 and 2, the OECs extract heat from pumped hot geothermal brine to vaporize isopentane, which in turn drives associated turbines and electrical generators.  The isopentane exiting the turbine is condensed, pumped and re-vaporized in a closed-loop cycle.  This unit utilizes a combination of heat exchangers, pumps, turbines, generators and piping from equipment formerly identified as the GBU process and adds new equipment to enable processing the pumped geothermal brine.  This revamped process was commissioned in 2020.  Approximately 18 megawatts of power is generated from this plant.\r\n\r\nEach of the Ormesa processes are subject to RMP, PSM and CalARP due to the presence of isopentane in excess of 10,000 pounds.  Isopentane is a listed flammable substance in RMP and CalARP.  Isopentane meets the definition of a flammable liquid under the PSM regulation. \r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analyses have been conducted for each of the three Ormesa processes.  A worst case release can potentially impact offsite public receptors on an adjacent recreational area.  The most stringent prevention program requirements are applied at all Ormesa processes.\r\n\r\nOrmat has revalidated the prevention programs required by RMP, PSM and CalARP.  \r\nProcess Safety Information:  \r\n\u00bf SDS (Safety Data Sheet) is available for isopentane and the hazards are well understood.  \r\n\u00bf Block flow and heat & mass balances are available for all processes\r\n\u00bf Maximum intended inventory is defined\r\n\u00bf Safe upper and lower limits with consequences of deviation are defined for each process.\r\n\u00bf Piping & Instrument Diagrams were revalidated in 2016 as part of the PHA revalidation effort for Ormesa 1 and 2.
