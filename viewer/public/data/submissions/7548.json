Since an ammonia release from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and since the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard, this facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nIn the ammonia refrigeration system, ammonia is transformed from vapor to liquid then back to vapor by mechanical compression, expansion, and evaporation in order to exchange heat to acheive a desired temperature in the storage and processing areas.   The high pressure ammonia vapor flows from the  compressors to the condensers where heat is removed, turning the vapor into a liquid.  The liquid from the condensers is collected in a high-pressure receiver.\n\nThe liquid ammonia is then circulated to the units (freezers, air units, storage tanks, and chillers) located in the production and storage areas.  The ammonia liquid flows across heat exchanger surfaces (coils, tubes, or freezer barrels) where it picks up heat, changing from a liquid to a vapor.  The ammonia vapor is then sent back to the compressor to start the cycle over.\n\nC.\tSummary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the facility involves release of 22,600 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to failure and loss of entire contents of one HPR.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environment (i.e. reaching a concentration less than 0.14 mg/L) according to the Ammonia Guidance method.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 The worst-case weather conditions that were used for this scenario do not occur every day;\n7 Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receivers;\n7 Ammonia is not corrosive in this service and the vessels are relatively new;\n7 Pressur"

The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has developed a Plant Safety Program based on the Voluntary Protection Program guidelines.  The mission of the plant Safety Program is to provide a safe work environment through involvement, commitment, and genuine caring by all employees.  Efficiency and safety performance is measured by closely tracking Lost Work Day Index and Injury Illness Rates.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.  The Utilities Team Leader is responsible for the management of accidental release prevention and the Safety Resource is responsible for management of the Emergency Response Programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic events.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Company operates a fruit juice processing facility at this location.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-) cont"
