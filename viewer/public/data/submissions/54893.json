The use of chlorine as a disinfectant: inactivates numerous pathogens potentially present in raw water supplies. The same properties that makes chlorine an essential part of protecting the public from waterborne diseases make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State Rules and Regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent to the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our employees. Our emergency response plan is based on the EPA's model for wastewater treatment plants and the Chlorine Institutes Pamphlet #64 Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The Emergency Response Plan includes notification of ( 911 ) Mission Fire Department Haz-Mat response protocol. The Mission Fire Department is the primary first responders in all chemical spill or release emergencies in Mission, Texas. Chlorine is delivered from the DOT approved ton containers on a flat bed trailer equiped with a hydraulically operated unloading device. The inventory of chlorine stored at this facility is 18,000 lbs. The worst case release scenario of a one ton container would release 2,000 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the contents would be released as a vapor, which is heavier than air. The distance to the endpoint of .0087 mg/l ( 3ppm ) would be .9 miles or less than 1 mile as determined by the EPA RMP COMP model. An alternative release scenario of a hole in a gas chlorine equipment would release 105 pounds of chlorine in ten minutes. The endpoint of .0087 mg/l ( 3ppm ) would extend a distance of 0.1 miles as determined by the"
