The facility management ensures that facility personnel continue to adhere to these safety procedures.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: Global Tungsten and Powders Corp. (GTP) is located in Towanda, PA in the Northeastern corner of the state. GTP's primary emphasis is the manufacturing of tungsten and molybdenum powders with additional emphasis on other specialty products. \n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7), and the corresponding regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, because of the on-site storage of anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen and aqueous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen storage operations comply with Prevention Program 3 of the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"), and the aqueous ammonia operations comply with the Prevention Program 2. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: The facility has developed and instituted procedures to prevent and effectively respond to any accidental releases from the processes.  These procedures were developed in accordance with both the OSHA PSM standards in 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and RMP 40 C.F.R. Part 68 requirements. \n\n\n\nThe facility regularly trains personnel who are responsible for operating and maintaining the processes, both in the classroom and on the job.  Additionally, the anhydrous ammonia storage system complies with OSHA's storage and handling requirements set forth in 29 C.F.R. 1910.11. \n\n\n\nAn outside supplier who incorporates safe procedures maintains the hydrogen storage and supply system.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: The facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents of anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen and aqueous ammonia since the submission of the last RMP.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has an existi"

This plan coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department and local emergency planning commission. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: The facility periodically reviews the program, training and maintenance procedures to identify any necessary changes that would improve safety at the facility.  Pursuant to this review procedure, the facility recently completed the following items: The GTP facility continues to complete inspections using API 510 and 570 on the Anhydrous Ammonia tanks and piping, Ammonia Hydroxide Storage tanks and virgin Hydrogen piping. The last inspection of this kind took place in 2017.  The facility also recenlty lowered the amount of Anhydrous Ammonia storage on site. We no longer have a rail car on site to supply our process, thus lowering the risk to our workers and the surrounding community. \n\n"
