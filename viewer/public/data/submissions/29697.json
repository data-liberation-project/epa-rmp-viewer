      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe RUTGERS Organics Corporation (formerly Bakelite Epoxy Polymers) Augusta Georgia plant is a custom batch manufacturer of a variety of organic chemicals that are used in various industries such as agriculture, coatings, and plastics.  The plant is located on a 77-acre tract of land in south Augusta, GA.  The original plant was built in 1980.  The product mix at the facility changes frequently due to the nature of the custom batch manufacturing business.\n\nThe Augusta plant currently stores and uses two chemicals that are listed on the RPM Toxic Chemicals list above the material?s threshold quantity.  These chemicals are epichlorohydrin (106-89-8) and 98% nitric acid (7637-37-2).\n\nThe 98% nitric acid is used in the manufacture of an herbicide intermediate.  The nitric acid is received via tank truck and is stored in a 7,500 gallon above ground; glass lined bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a diked area.\n\nEpichlorohydrin is used the in manufacture of epoxy resin and diluents.  The epichlorohydrin is received via tank truck and is stored in a 15,000 gallon above ground bulk storage tank.  The tank is located within a diked area.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nRUTGERS Organics Corporation Augusta Plant is committed to conducting operations in a manner that prevents accidental chemical releases.  RUTGERS Organics? policy is to design, maintain, operate and audit operations to make sure the possibility of a chemical release is kept as low as possible.  In the unlikely event an accidental chemical release does occur, RUTGERS Organics? policy is to have a well trained and prepared workforce capably of responding to a release and have the equipment and facilities available to minimize the release and its affects on employees, the public, and the environment.  The RUTGERS Organics Augusta Plant?s accidental release prevention program, coupled with the emergency response program consists of multiple safeguards or ?layers of protection? designed to pr"

Hazard assessments are performed on the initial process design and every five years afterwards.  Safety systems are designed into the process that actively or passively help minimize the effects of a chemical release.  Equipment and piping are designed and installed per established industry codes and standards, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the National Fire Protection Association.  All changes to a process are thoroughly reviewed by technical and health and safety personnel to ensure any change to equipment, procedures, chemicals, etc. will not affect the safety of employees, the environment, or the public.\n\nThe second layer of the prevention program involves the maintenance of process equipment.  A preventative maintenance program is in place that is designed to identify problems with plant equipment before they occur.  All critical safety equipment is checked regularly and prior to process startup to ensure it operates as designed.  Inspections and tests of critical devices such as relief valves, pressure vessels, and storage tanks are regularly performed to ensure the integrity and function of the equipment are maintained.  In addition, maintenance personnel are highly skilled and regularly trained.\n\nOperating the plant in a safe manner makes up the third layer of the Augusta Plant?s prevention program.  Operators are trained on a process prior to startup and at least every three years afterwards.  All operations are conducted using written procedures that have been reviewed and approved by management and technical personnel.  Access to the plant is restricted to authorized employees, authorized visitors, and authorized contractors.  Areas where epichlorohydrin and 98% nitric acid are stored and handles are further restricted during handling operations.  Sensitive and/or critical process p"

      "SummaryText": "arameters, such as process temperatures and pressures are continuously monitored either by computer or operators.  Maintaining an excellent safety program is considered everyone?s responsibility.\n\nThe fourth layer of the accident prevention program involves auditing plant operations.  Internal reviews by plant management and health and safety personnel are regularly performed to ensure employees are doing their job correctly and safely.  Operating procedures are reviewed periodically to guarantee that they are current and reflect design intentions.  All processes undergo a pre-startup safety review that confirms design specifications have been followed, procedures are in place, a process hazard analysis has been performed and all recommendations from the analysis have been implemented, and that training for all employees involved in the process has been conducted.  Should any incident occur involving a chemical release, no matter how small, the incident is investigated and any recommendations from the investigation are implemented to ensure the possibility of any future occurrence is minimized.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental releases involving either or the two RMP regulated substances, in excess of the material?s respective reportable quantity at the RUTGERS Organics plant over the last five years.\n\nWorst-case Scenario\n\nIn accordance with EPA?s Risk Management regulations, the worst-case scenario estimated to result in the greatest distance to a specified toxic endpoint has been identified.  The worst-case scenario consists of a release of 15,000 gallons of epichlorohydrin which is the entire contents of bulk storage tank S-10.  The release is considered to occur as a result of the catastrophic failure of the bulk storage tank.  This particular scenario considers the release to occur within a diked area.  The release rate to the air is 442 pounds per minute.  Using worst case weather conditions as specified by EPA, the distance to epichol"

      "SummaryText": "orhydrin?s toxic endpoint, 0.076 mg/L, is 4.2 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in the RMP*Comp software program.\n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nAn alternate release scenario has been developed for both of the RMP substance identified above.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for 98% nitric acid involves the release of 7,900 pounds of 98% nitric acid resulting from the failure of a 1? pipeline used to transfer the nitric acid from the bulk tank to a 200 gallon charge tank.  The initial operational flow rate through this pipeline is 20 gallons/minute with an operational pressure of 20 psi.  The release duration is assumed to be10 minutes with a release rate to outside air of 790 pounds/minute.  The release occurs outside of containment.  Using alternative release case weather conditions as specified by EPA, the distance to nitric acid?s toxic endpoint, 0.026 mg/L is 0.4 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and calculations included in the RMP*Comp software program.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for epichlorihydrin involves the release of  45 pounds of epichloroyhdrin over a 1 minute time frame from an unloading hose during tank truck offloading.  The release occurs within containment.  Using the alaternative release case weather conditions as specified by EPA, the distance to epichlorohydrin?s toxic endpoint, 0.076 mg/L is 0.1 miles.  This result is based on the instructions and  calculations included in the RMP*Comp software program. \n  \nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RUTGERS Organics Augusta Plant?s emergency response program is based on two fundamentals: (1) having a properly trained and prepared workforce, and (2) if a release does occur, have the equipment and procedures necessary to minimized the possible health and environmental effects of the release.  Theses are the last two layers of chemical release protection.\n\nTraining involves all personnel at the Augusta Plant.  The plant has trained HAZMAT Technician"
