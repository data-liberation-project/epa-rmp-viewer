      "SummaryText": "1.   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nWe at Leprino Foods Company, are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Although our primary coordination is with the Tioga County LEPC hazardous materials teams, due to our facility's location, which is on the border of New York and Pennsylvania state, we also have provided a copy of this plan to Bradford County (Pennsylvania) LEPC.\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activity encompasses  Cheese Manufacturing.  The plant is located at 400 Leprino Avenue, Waverly, New York.  We have one RMP-regulated substance, Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, at our facility. which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.  The maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at our facility is approximately 24,250 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measurers to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario, are as follows:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and EPA Model RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario represents a complete catastropic discharge from the defined \"main system\" over a 10 minute"

      "SummaryText": " release period.  This could be caused, for example, by a ruptured high pressure ammonia receiver coupled with valve failures.  The scenario involves the release of 9,500 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia over ten minutes.  Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 M/S wind speed, and a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  No credit has been taken for existing active and passive mitigation systems that reduce the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe alternative scenario consists of an Anhydrous Ammonia release from failed seals on a brine chiller pump.  This scenario, as directed by EPA Guidelines Offsite Consequence Analysis, is based on a five (5) year historical review of past incidents.The seal leakage is equivalent to a 0.25\" diameter opening.  The scenario involves a release rate of 100 pounds per minute.  The guidance used to develop the release distance did not assume a specific release duration and is applicable to releases of all lengths.  In the event of an actual release, it is expected that operators would intervene to stop the release within a ten minute period.\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration system is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards asociated w"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval  (five years or when changes dictate).  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.  All training is documented and validated by employees, on the Leprino Foods Company Training Tracking System.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage receivers, piping systems relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technolog"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are to be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nLeprino Foods Company has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the past five (5) years.  There have been, however, four (4) minor accidental releases, none of which caused any injuries to workers inside or outside the plant.  A 20 pound Anhydrous Ammonia release in June of 1997 was caused by a leaking shaft seal.  In November 1997, 10 pound release was caused by a leaking pump seal.  A 50 pound release in March, 1998, was due to a crack in a fitting on a control valve.  A 5 pound release in February of 2002 was caused by a leaking ammonia pump seal.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Waverly facility coordinates its emergency response plan with the Tioga County LEPC.\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Completion of the PHA recommendations are expected to occur by April 23, 2003."
