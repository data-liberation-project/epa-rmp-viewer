Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe FPL Cape Canaveral Power Plant is owned by the Florida Power and Light Company.   The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency action plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases. \n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe FPL Cape Canaveral facility is a power plant that generates electricity.  The facility is located at 6000 US 1 North, in Cocoa,  Brevard County, Florida. The plant uses a chlorination process to treat its once-through cooling waterand control biological growth in their cooling water intake. \n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to five one-ton containers at the Chlorination process.  Two one-ton cylinders are always connected to the process with three additional containers stored adjacent to the connected containers.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 10,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is not in an enclosed building.\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and is therefore also subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Cape Canaveral Power Plant Chlorination process in the Program 3 level.  The Cape Canaveral Power Plant will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\nThe PSM Program includes written operating procedures for the chlorination process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on worker protection.  These procedures will be used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the chlorination process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  The PSM Program also includes a"

      "SummaryText": " preventative maintenance plan which requires all chlorination equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This will ensure that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment.  Safe work practices, such as Lockout/Tagout, have long been required by the Cape Canaveral Power Plant Operations Department.  These were reviewed and updated to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the Prevention Program include the equipment information and Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).    The staff has also performed  Process Hazard Analyses of the process.  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation have also been incorporated into this program to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Florida Power and Light Company Cape Canaveral Power Plant facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years that caused any offsite injury or harm as defined in the RMP regulation.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Cape Canaveral Power Plant has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The facility will rely on outsite responders to respond to a chlorine accidental release.  The current plan has been coordinated with the Brevard County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 9-911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\n\n6.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe facility plans to increase employee participation and involvement in the maintenance of PSM and RMP documentation."
