Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The Taft Manufacturing Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and safety data sheet (SDS) of all chemicals on-site is made available upon request. \r\nIn addition to the activities outlined above, we recognize the hazard to operations represented to many operations in California by earthquakes by conducting periodic documented structural integrity inspections of equipment used in acrolein storage and transfer as well as all other piping systems, coupling, and valves on site.  All piping and transfer systems were constructed in compliance state and federal codes and are so maintained.  \r\n\r\n4.    Five-year Accident History\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company has had good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been only three (3) accidental releases of the RMP regulated substance over this period which resulted in one (1) recordable injury to an employee.\r\n\r\n5.   Emergency Response Plan\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any p"

The completed management of change form shall be approved by management before any changed is put to service.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews - Pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Taft Manufacturing Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits- The Baker Hughes Corporation supports the Taft Manufacturing Company by conducting internal audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits of RMP covered processes are conducted at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are initiated in a safe and prompt manner.  In addition Process Safety Management audits are conducted every 3 years.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation- The Taft Manufacturing Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation- The Taft Manufacturing Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention requires a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company facility located in Taft, California is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Release [40 CFR 68] because its Acrolein production, storage and loading process contains more than the threshold quantities of acrolein (CAS No. 107-02-8) and propylene (CAS No. 115-07-1). Acrolein is a toxic and flammable substance which is a liquid at ambient temperatures.  Propylene is a flammable substance which is a gas at ambient conditions, but is carefully stored under pressure as a liquid at the Taft Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company uses air, propylene, and steam to produce specification-grade acrolein.  The raw materials are feed into a reactor with a catalyst that converts the propylene to acrolein.  The acrolein is separated from the other reactant by-products and residues in a series of quench columns, a stripper, and two distillation columns.  The finished product acrolein is collected in three 1,000 gallon process tanks and ultimately transferred into and stored in dedicated ISO-containers on flatbed railcars for repackaging.\r\n\r\nA maximum inventory of 260,000 lbs. of propylene can be on site at any one time with up to 130,000 lbs. of propylene per railcar storage vessel. The process generates approximately 700 lbs./hr. of acrolein, with up to 30,000 lbs. present in a single ISO-container and a total of twelve (12) ISO - containers on site.\r\n\r\nThe Taft Manufacturing Company utilizes standard operating procedures, training, administrative and engineering controls, and other safety practices to assure that acrolein and propylene are handled in a safe manner. Details of the facility's extensive prevention program are summarized in Section 3.0.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Facilities\r\nWe at the Taft Manufacturing Company are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a"
