      "SummaryText": "Altivia has a warehouse located in Manor, TX (\"CenTx site\") where they store 150lb and 2,000 lb chlorine cylinders.  The CenTx site does not use or process chlorine, but only warehouses the cylinders.\n\nFull cylinders are received from suppliers and stored until needed by customers.  When the full cylinders are dropped off with customers, empty cylinders are picked up and returned to the CenTx site.  Empty cylinders are returned to the chlorine company when they deliver full cylinders.\n\nThe CenTx facility follows regulations established by DOT, DHS (Department of Homeland Security), OSHA and EPA that govern the safe handling, storage and transportation of chlorine cylinders.  The facility is subject to the requirements of the EPA RMP program, but is exempt from the requirements of the OSHA PSM program due to its status as a \"retail facility\".\n\nThe CenTx facility has established operating procedures, maintenance programs and performed hazard reviews according to both the RMP rules and industry-standard practices; specifically the practices noted in Chlorine Institute pamphlets 1, 91 and other publications.  These help Altivia minimize the likelyhood of releases.\n\nAltivia has developed an emergency response plan that details the steps that the CenTx facility will take in the event of a chemical release, including the roles of internal and external responders.  Altivia also has developed methods for identifying small releases before they become problematic, including daily inspections of all stored chlorine cylinders and ambient chlorine monitoring systems.  \n\nThe facility recently completed a hazard review for the storage of chlorine and is implementing the recommendations of the hazard review.  Altivia expects to complete all of these recommendations no later than July 1, 2008.\n\nThe facility has not been in operation prior to May 2008 and has not had any releases of chlorine in the past."
