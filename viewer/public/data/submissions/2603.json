Our employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is a country elevator and farm supply sale. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and redistributed as a valuable fertilizer resource for our farm customers to grow food. Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 78,800 pounds or 15300 gallons in a18,000gallon capacity tank. The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM at 2.11 miles from the tank. Due to the location of the tank in the complex. There would be minimal impact to off-site personnel. The maximum release would be at 7,880 lb. \n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM at .46 miles from the tank.  Again it would have minimal impact off-site as the gas would barely escape the boundaries of our property.\n\nWe have instituted procedures for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as required by OSHA and The Indiana State Chemist into our plan.\n\nWe have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40CFR 68.48 in the past.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is up to date and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures. All new hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.\n\nSit is the policy of Jasper County Co-op to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release. We will continue to conduct self-audits and compliance inspections of equipment and procedures on a schedule basis in addition to the pre-transfer inspections. Through our inspection process and insistence of maintaining equipment with the Federal, State and local agencies"
