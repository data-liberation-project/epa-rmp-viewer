      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR MOUNT VERNON MILLS, INC., APPAREL FABRICS DIVISION\n\n\n\nWhat does Mount Vernon do to be environmentally responsible?\n\n\n\n    At Mount Vernon, we have taken an aggressive position for many years to reduce or eliminate the use of regulated substances in our manufacturing processes.  Aside from being beneficial to the environment, we have found it easier to run our operations without the excessive monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping necessary to comply with regulations governing the use of some of the less environmentally friendly substances.  While not always possible to eliminate all regulated chemicals entirely, we have greatly minimized their use.  Our Environmental Management Program revolves around 10-point criteria developed as a charter member of the [former] American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) Encouraging Environmental Excellence (E3) Program.  Though our industry has changed dramatically over recent years, as have the industry trade associations with whom we affiliate ourselves, the foundation of our program and our dedication to being good stewards of the environment has not.  Below are the 10-point criteria and our Corporate Environmental Policy that form the core structure of our environmental management program.  Over the years, Mount Vernon has received recognition for demonstrating its environmental commitment at the Model Level of the Georgia Pollution Prevention Partners Program and certification in the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.  We have also received several individual recognitions that include the 1999 Air and Waste Management Association (AWMA) Certificate of Achievement for going beyond regulatory obligation with respect to waste minimization and pollution prevention, the 1999 Georgia Governor's Award for Pollution Prevention honorable mention, and the 2001 Georgia Governor's Award for Pollution Prevention winner in the large industry category.\n\n\n\n    The chemistry that goes into the manufacturin"

This process includes the review of every chemical used throughout our company to ensure strict regulatory compliance with all air and water permits and state and federal environmental and safety standards.  Environmental compliance assessments are conducted at each of our manufacturing plants on a regular basis. \n\n\n\n    Through our environmental management program, we make every possible effort to limit or forbid the usage of regulated substances in our plants.  As a result, our largest manufacturing operation and finishing plant in Trion, Georgia is permitted by EPA to operate as a minor source for hazardous air pollutants, thereby avoiding an excessive regulatory burden that would inhibit our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace.  We also routinely review certain non-governmental restricted substance lists (RSL's), such as those of Levi Strauss, AAFA, Gap, Oeko-Tex and others, to make certain that our raw materials do not contain, nor are our fabrics manufactured with these substances, unless at acceptable trace (background) levels.  For instance, it is our corporate policy that raw materials manufactured with PFOA for use in certain fluorocarbon finishes be forbidden.  We have chosen to seek non-PFOA alternatives, and any stain release or durable press fabrics purchased from us would be free of these compounds to the best of our knowledge as certified by our raw material vendors.  Additionally, it is our policy not to use any of the azo dyes that would break down and form any of the cancer causing amines that are banned under the European Ordinance.  We also ensure that our fabrics are not manufacture"

      "SummaryText": "ts.  Mount Vernon has responded to our customers' needs for high performance flame resistant (FR) fabrics.  There are several inherently flame resistant manmade fibers, such as NomexR and KevlarR, which can provide adequate protection to workers.  However, cotton and cotton-rich blends are the fibers of choice by most workers for comfort.  The most advanced technology for imparting durable FR properties to cotton that will withstand the rigorous industry standard 100 commercial launderings without any degradation of FR performance utilizes a phosphonium sulfate and urea based precondensate.  Once applied to the fabric, this chemical is cross linked with ammonia and then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to complete the reaction to form a polymer that becomes permanently polymerized within the fabric.  The flame resistance of these 100% cotton or cotton blended fabrics is durable for the life of the garment when laundering is in accordance with the garment manufacturer's instructions.  The anhydrous ammonia handled for this purpose is the substance that is subject to regulation by the EPA Accidental Release Prevention and OSHA Process Safety Management Rules and the subject of this Risk Management Plan.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a tank as a liquid under pressure, and once warmed to room temperature and normal pressure becomes the ammonia gas that is used in the process.  The vast majority of the ammonia gas used is consumed in the process, and any remaining ammonia gas is routed through a scrubber system where it is reclaimed for reuse or proper disposal.  Mount Vernon complies with all air and water quality regulations that would govern this process under our environmental permits.  We also routinely monitor employee exposures to ammonia in the areas involving this process to ensure that our workplace is as safe as possible and that we are well under the permissible exposure limit for this regulated substance.\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat accidental release prevention and emergen"

When it becomes necessary to use a regulated chemical such as anhydrous ammonia because no alternative exists, Mount Vernon provides comprehensive safety training (hazard communication) to all employees affected by the process that uses the chemical.  This training includes emergency action training pertaining to evacuation and spill response.  Mount Vernon has a written Emergency Action Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (Spill Plan) that address emergencies involving the release of chemicals and how we would protect our employees as well as the environment and the community around us.  The Spill Plan also addresses the prevention measures that we have taken to minimize or eliminate the potential for a chemical spill to impact the environment or expose our employees or the surrounding community.  Mount Vernon's written Chemical Hazard Information Program provides information on the proper storage and handling of chemicals that are used, and any associated hazards represented by these chemicals to all employees who transport, handle, use, work around, or in some other way may be exposed to hazardous substances in the work place. With this information, employees can safely handle hazardous materials in a safe and healthy working environment.

Where we perform maintenance on process equipment, it is conducted by employees who are sufficiently trained to perform the maintenance task and on the operation of the process and potential hazards associated with the use of ammonia in the process.  Additionally, the manufacturer of the outside ammonia storage tank and vaporizer performs preventive maintenance on this system under a maintenance contract with us.  The individuals (drivers) who deliver the anhydrous ammonia from our supplier are highly trained to safely transfer the product from the cargo truck to the storage tank without incident.  The ammonia storage facilities are equipped with sensors that will automatically activate a water fog mitigation system in the event of the detection of an ammonia leak from the tank or any of the valves or other connections to the tank system.  The water fog will prevent an ammonia vapor cloud from forming and minimize the impact of any release.  The water runoff from the activation of the fog system is collected within a containment area around the tank system to prevent it from getting into storm drains and the river.  The system is also equipped with instrumentation that shuts off the flow of ammonia automatically if certain conditions exist, such as excess flow from a leak or other release, including during the transfer of product from the cargo truck to the tank if a transfer hose were to break.  Upon shutdown of the process and/or prior to maintenance, certain procedures must be followed to de-energize and/or purge the process of ammonia gas before additional tasks can be initiated, which eliminates the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia due to human error.
