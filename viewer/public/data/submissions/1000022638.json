Aside from being beneficial to the environment, we have found it easier to run our operations without the excessive monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping necessary to comply with regulations governing the use of some of the less environmentally friendly substances.  While not always possible to eliminate all regulated chemicals entirely, we have greatly minimized their use.  Our Environmental Management Program revolves around 10-point criteria developed as a charter member of the [former] American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI) Encouraging Environmental Excellence (E3) Program.  Though our industry has changed dramatically over recent years, as have the industry trade associations with whom we affiliate ourselves, the foundation of our program and our dedication to being good stewards of the environment has not.  Below are the 10-point criteria and our Corporate Environmental Policy that form the core structure of our environmental management program.  Over the years, Mount Vernon has received recognition for demonstrating its environmental commitment at the Model Level of the Georgia Pollution Prevention Partners Program and certification in the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.  We have also received several individual recognitions that include the 1999 Air and Waste Management Association (AWMA) Certificate of Achievement for going beyond regulatory obligation with respect to waste minimization and pollution prevention, the 1999 Georgia Governor's Award for Pollution Prevention honorable mention, and the 2001 Georgia Governor's Award for Pollution Prevention winner in the large industry category.\r\n\r\n\tThe chemistry that goes into the manufacturin"

This process includes the review of every chemical used throughout our company to ensure strict regulatory compliance with all air and water permits and state and federal environmental and safety standards.  Environmental compliance assessments are conducted at each of our manufacturing plants on a regular basis. \r\n\r\n\tThrough our environmental management program, we make every possible effort to limit or forbid the usage of regulated substances in our plants.  As a result, our largest manufacturing operation and finishing plant in Trion, Georgia is permitted by EPA to operate as a minor source for hazardous air pollutants, thereby avoiding an excessive regulatory burden that would inhibit our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace.  We also routinely review certain non-governmental restricted substance lists (RSL's), such as those of Levi Strauss, AAFA, Gap, Oeko-Tex and others, to make certain that our raw materials do not contain, nor are our fabrics manufactured with these substances, unless at acceptable trace (background) levels.  For instance, it is our corporate policy that raw materials manufactured with PFOA for use in certain fluorocarbon finishes be forbidden.  We have chosen to seek non-PFOA alternatives, and any stain release or durable press fabrics purchased from us would be free of these compounds to the best of our knowledge as certified by our raw material vendors.  Additionally, it is our policy not to use any of the azo dyes that would break down and form any of the cancer causing amines that are banned under the European Ordinance.

      "SummaryText": "ts.  Mount Vernon has responded to our customers' needs for high performance flame resistant (FR) fabrics.  There are several inherently flame resistant manmade fibers, such as NomexR and KevlarR, which can provide adequate protection to workers.  However, cotton and cotton-rich blends are the fibers of choice by most workers for comfort.  The most advanced technology for imparting durable FR properties to cotton that will withstand the rigorous industry standard 100 commercial launderings without any degradation of FR performance utilizes a phosphonium sulfate and urea based precondensate.  Once applied to the fabric, this chemical is cross linked with ammonia and then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to complete the reaction to form a polymer that becomes permanently polymerized within the fabric.  The flame resistance of these 100% cotton or cotton blended fabrics is durable for the life of the garment when laundering is in accordance with the garment manufacturer's instructions.  The anhydrous ammonia handled for this purpose is the substance that is subject to regulation by the EPA Accidental Release Prevention and OSHA Process Safety Management Rules and the subject of this Risk Management Plan.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in a tank as a liquid under pressure, and once warmed to room temperature and normal pressure becomes the ammonia gas that is used in the process.  The vast majority of the ammonia gas used is consumed in the process, and any remaining ammonia gas is routed through a scrubber system where it is reclaimed for reuse or proper disposal.  Mount Vernon complies with all air and water quality regulations that would govern this process under our environmental permits.  We also routinely monitor employee exposures to ammonia in the areas involving this process to ensure that our workplace is as safe as possible and that we are well under the permissible exposure limit for this regulated substance.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhat accidental release prevention and emergen"

When it becomes necessary to use a regulated chemical such as anhydrous ammonia because no alternative exists, Mount Vernon provides comprehensive safety training (hazard communication) to all employees affected by the process that uses the chemical.  This training includes emergency action training pertaining to evacuation and spill response.  Mount Vernon has a written Emergency Action Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (Spill Plan) that address emergencies involving the release of chemicals and how we would protect our employees as well as the environment and the community around us.  The Spill Plan also addresses the prevention measures that we have taken to minimize or eliminate the potential for a chemical spill to impact the environment or expose our employees or the surrounding community.  Mount Vernon's written Chemical Hazard Information Program provides information on the proper storage and handling of chemicals that are used, and any associated hazards represented by these chemicals to all employees who transport, handle, use, work around, or in some other way may be exposed to hazardous substances in the work place. With this information, employees can safely handle hazardous materials in a safe and healthy working environment.

The design and construction of the ammonia storage and handling system meets the requirements of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We also comply with the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119, and EPA Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR 68, Subpart D, Program 3.  Mount Vernon has a written Process Safety and Risk Management Program that addresses our compliance with the requirements of these two regulations pertaining to anhydrous ammonia storage and handling.  Mount Vernon follows strict equipment manufacturers guidelines for the maintenance and upkeep of"

      "SummaryText": "equipment involved in the ammonia process.  Where we perform maintenance on process equipment, it is conducted by employees who are sufficiently trained to perform the maintenance task and on the operation of the process and potential hazards associated with the use of ammonia in the process.  Additionally, the manufacturer of the outside ammonia storage tank and vaporizer performs preventive maintenance on this system under a maintenance contract with us.  The individuals (drivers) who deliver the anhydrous ammonia from our supplier are highly trained to safely transfer the product from the cargo truck to the storage tank without incident.  The ammonia storage facilities are equipped with sensors that will automatically activate a water fog mitigation system in the event of the detection of an ammonia leak from the tank or any of the valves or other connections to the tank system.  The water fog will prevent an ammonia vapor cloud from forming and minimize the impact of any release.  The water runoff from the activation of the fog system is collected within a containment area around the tank system to prevent it from getting into storm drains and the river.  The system is also equipped with instrumentation that shuts off the flow of ammonia automatically if certain conditions exist, such as excess flow from a leak or other release, including during the transfer of product from the cargo truck to the tank if a transfer hose were to break.  Upon shutdown of the process and/or prior to maintenance, certain procedures must be followed to de-energize and/or purge the process of ammonia gas before additional tasks can be initiated, which eliminates the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia due to human error.  The ammonia facilities are secured by fencing and barriers, and monitored to prevent the intentional release of ammonia.  Mount Vernon has a written Hazardous Materials Security Plan that addresses the safe and secure handling, storage and transporting o"

      "SummaryText": "f hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nWhat is Mount Vernon's five-year accident history for ammonia?\r\n\r\nMount Vernon has been handling smaller quantities of anhydrous ammonia for about six years.  We have had no spills or accidental releases during this time.\r\n\r\nWhat are the basic elements of Mount Vernon's emergency response program for ammonia?\r\n\r\nThe core of Mount Vernon's emergency response program is based on our Emergency Action Plan, Emergency Response Guidelines for Spills and Fires, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Flood Emergency Plan, Hazard Communication Program, and Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  Mount Vernon has employees who have completed 40-hour Hazmat Technician Level training under OSHA HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120.  These individuals are also members of the Trion Fire Department.  They are trained and equipped to respond to a leak with the intention of stopping the leak in the shortest amount of time possible.  Hazmat Technician trained individuals receive annual refresher training in accordance with OSHA HAZWOPER.  The Trion Fire Department, which is located on site at our facility, conducts routine emergency response training (Hazmat Awareness Training) for all fire fighters, and includes training in coordination with Mount Vernon at least semi-annually with emphasis placed on the ammonia system.  The Trion Fire Department is a member of the Tri-State Mutual Aid Association in Chattanooga, TN.  The Walker County Fire Department, also a member of this association, operates a Hazmat Response Team within 15 miles of the facility and would respond as a back-up as necessary to a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The Trion Fire Department also has a mutual aid agreement with Chattooga County (\"county\") that includes response to emergencies of various natures throughout the county.  Mount Vernon's emergency response plan is incorporated into the county emergency response plan through the Trion Fir"

      "SummaryText": "e Department.  Mount Vernon also provides Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 312 (Tier 2) information to the state, county and local emergency responders utilizing the Emergency Response Information System (E-Plan).  Data pertaining to the presence of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is updated at least annually in E-Plan.  The activation of the ammonia sensors and the fog mitigation system on the ammonia facilities or the ammonia sensor at the process equipment in the plant automatically notifies the Trion Fire Department.  All detectors, sensors and mitigation systems are checked and calibrated (if necessary) on a routine basis under our preventive maintenance program to ensure their reliability.\r\nWhat does Mount Vernon have planned to improve safety?\r\nThough we have attempted through a thorough initial process hazard analysis to consider every possible release scenario that could result in injury to someone or impact on the environment and to incorporate controls accordingly, we will continue to encourage our employees to participate in the periodic re-evaluation and re-assessment of our Process Safety and Risk Management Program, particularly when future process hazard analyses are conducted on the ammonia process.  By increasing the capacity of our storage tank, we are also greatly reducing the frequency of deliveries of anhydrous ammonia.  This will result in less exposure of not only the Trion Community to cargo trucks transporting this chemical, but also many other communities that these trucks must travel through."
