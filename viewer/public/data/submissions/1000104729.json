The Ammonia system contains liquefied gas under pressure, and is regulated as a toxic substance. The site stores ISO vessels containing trimethylchlorosilane, which is also regulated as a toxic substance.The COOPER RIVER PARTNERS site does not have any flammables that require inclusion in the Risk Management Plan.\nCRP uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the plant-wide refrigeration system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. Exposure to ammonia can irritate the eyes, nose and throat.
