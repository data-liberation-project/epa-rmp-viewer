Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Hermiston Power Project is an electric generating station located approximately 5 miles south of Hermiston, Oregon.  The facility  is owned and operated by Hermiston Power Partnership, an Oregon General Partnership consisting of the partners CPN Hermiston, Inc. and Calpine Hermiston, Inc.  The Hermiston Power Project handles anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our employees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.   Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nHermiston Power Project?s emergency response program is designed to effectively respond to an accidental release of ammonia.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, and the National Response Center.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during combustion.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in two storage tanks.  The ammonia is transported by pipeline, from storage and injected into the exhaust system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products through selective catalytic reduction to minimize NOx emissions to the air.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authoriz"

The maximum amount of ammonia that can be stored at this station is 146,780 pounds (73,390 pounds in each of two storage tanks).\n\n3.  The Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by EPA is the release of the full contents of the largest ammonia storage vessel within 10 minutes with simultaneous failure of all control and mitigation systems and at a time when weather conditions would cause the maximum downwind transport distance.  At the Hermiston Power Project, the worst-case release would be a catastrophic failure of one of the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to capacity.  This worst-case scenario would release 73,390 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor within 10 minutes of the failure.\n\nThe distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14mg/l ammonia for this worst-case scenario is 4.9 miles.\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nThe more realistic alternative-case release would be the failure of a 2-inch diameter anhydrous ammonia fill pipeline.  This scenario would result in a total release of 47 pounds of ammonia. \n\nThe distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14mg/l ammonia for this alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n \n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Hermiston Power Project complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Hermiston Power Project?s documented training program.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life o"
