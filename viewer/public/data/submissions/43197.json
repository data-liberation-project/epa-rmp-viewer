MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 18 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F.E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nWeymouth's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  It has also been determined that the Chlorination Facility qualifies as a Program 3 process under both RMP and the CalARP Program. \n\nAn integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an emergency.\n\nThe following i"

It was designed to process 520 million gallons of water a day (520 mgd).  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Program rules,   as well as the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nThe chlorination system at Weymouth is composed of the following components: (1) a totally contained chlorine feed system to receive, store, and deliver liquid chlorine to the evaporators, chlorine expansion vessels, associated piping and valving, leak sensors and monitors, and instrumentation, (2) totally contained evaporators to heat chlorine and convert it to gas for use in the chlorinators (evaporator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (3) totally contained chlorinators to regulate flow of chlorine gas under vacuum to the ejectors (chlorinator units, associated piping and valving, and instrumentation), (4) ejectors to mix the chlorine gas with service water and inject chlorine solution at application points throughout the plant, and (5) chlorine gas treatment system for capture and neutralization of an accidental chlorine release in the contained areas (scrubbers, caustic soda, fans, pumps, and associated piping and valving).\n\nThe chlorine storage vessels are totally contained in the chlorination facility storage bays.\n\nThe process flow for the chlorination system begins at the liquid chlorine angle valves located on the storage vessels in each storage bay, connected by flexible metallic hose to the fixed piping system.

As discussed in the Executive Summary of the June 2004 RMP submission under \u00bfPlanned Changes to Improve Safety,\u00bf MWDSC decided to modify the Weymouth Chlorination Facility with a chlorine containment and scrubbing system to capture and neutralize an accidental chlorine release.  The decision to install the chlorine containment and scrubbing system was made to further enhance safety and mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release.  The chlorine containment and scrubbing process modification is now in operation.\n\nThe  information required in the RMP Executive Summary is provided below for the newly modified chlorination system at Weymouth.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MWDSC accidental release prevention policy for chlorine involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.\n\nWeymouth has an excellent safety record with almost 60 years of chlorine use.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MWDSC F.E.

The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form chlorine solution that subsequently mixes with the water supply at different stages of the treatment process for disinfection purposes.\n\nThe chlorine containment area, near the Administration Building is continuously monitored in the control room by video camera and chlorine leak detectors.  Chlorine leak sensors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each storage vessel valve connecting to the process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by closing the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the chlorination facility and beside the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either chlorine storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.

Such an update of chlorine operations training took place together with the update of chlorine operating procedures to incorporate changes in chlorine operations associated with the chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.\n\nWeymouth prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nWeymouth has procedures and policies in place that ensure that the contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work.  The contractors are informed, prior to the initiation of the work at the site, of the applicable provisions of the emergency response plan.  Weymouth holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area; controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor's safety performance.\n\nPre-Startup"

      "SummaryText": "Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nWeymouth ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new process covered by this regulation, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.  Weymouth maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Weymouth\u00bfs mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n\u00b7\tWritten procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n\u00b7\tImplementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n\u00b7\tTraining of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program procedures; safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions; and safe use and application of special equipment and/or unique tools.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nWeymouth requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the covered process.  Weymouth uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nWeymouth provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows Weymouth staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the prog"

Weymouth will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWeymouth investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the Weymouth chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Weymouth during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nWeymouth does not have any HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond to emergency chlorine releases.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the La Verne Fire Department and Los Angeles County Fire Department will be called to handle a chlorine release.   Weymouth coordinates with local response agencies (La Verne and Los Angeles County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Weymouth chl"

Specially trained Weymouth employees will be available during such a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine process in 1992, 1995 and 1998, when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the facility.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in January 2004 and 2005, when the  process hazard and seismic risk analyses were reviewed and updated to include the new chlorine containment and scrubbing system modification.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and will be resolved in a timely fashion."
