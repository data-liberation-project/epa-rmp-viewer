KFO consists of three adjacent, but not contiguous, operating areas - the Kennewick Area, Hedges Area, and Finley Area.  The Hedges Area is currently on standby and all chemical inventories have been removed.  KFO facilities are located on the west bank of the Columbia River with open fields, industrial neighbors, and rural residences in the general area.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought into KFO by railcar and stored in atmospheric storage tanks, pressurized spheres, or cylindrical tanks in both the Kennewick Area and Finley Area.  In the Finley Area anhydrous ammonia is stored for resale, is transferred via pipeline for processing into nitric acid in the Kennewick Area, and it is mixed with water to make aqua ammonia.  \n\nIn the Kennewick Area anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture nitric acid and is also mixed with nitric acid in a process vessel called a neutralizer to produce liquid 83% ammonium nitrate (AN-83).  AN-83 is primarily an intermediate stream that is processed into liquid fertilizer solutions but is also sold as a product.  Aqua ammonia is delivered to the Kennewick Area for use in pH adjustment in the production of UAN-32 liquid fertilizer solution.  \n\nKFO is a wholesaler, and sales of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are typically in tanker truck load quantities picked up by regional retail customers at the facilities.   \n\n1.  KFO accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nKFO has management policy statements at the Corporate and plant management level endorsing the practice of all necessary measures to maintain safe operations.  Operating personnel are authorized to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to responds to an emergency.  KFO has an emergency response plan with detailed response procedures.\n\nKFO also has a series of Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Wor"
