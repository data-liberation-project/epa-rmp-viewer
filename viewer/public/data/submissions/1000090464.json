The operating procedures were last revised on July 17, 2020. \r\n\r\nTRAINING:  The Yuba City Facility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program was last reviewed on April 15, 2020. \r\n\r\nThe current training program is comprised of the following:\r\n  1.  Initial employee training.\r\n  2.  Periodic refresher training.\r\n  3.  Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification.\r\n  4.  Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training.\r\n  5.  Training records for each employee.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE AND MECHANICAL INTEGRITY:  The maintenance program at the Facility is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The maintenance program includes equipment inspection, preventative maintenance, recordkeeping, and training. The latest equipment inspections were conducted on April 15, 2020, and the latest review of maintenance procedures was conducted on July 17, 2020.\r\n\r\nRMP MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:  Operation, safety, and environmental issues must be reviewed prior to initiation of a process change to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the Anhydrous Ammonia Process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The Facility RMP Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures. The MOC process process was triggered on April 25, 2019. The MOC procedures were last reviewed or modified on July 1"

Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre start-up safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre start-up safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. A PSSR was conducted on April 25, 2019.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on March 28, 2018.\r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place. The program includes investigation requirements and reporting and would be implemented in the event of an incident. \r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:  The Facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations.
