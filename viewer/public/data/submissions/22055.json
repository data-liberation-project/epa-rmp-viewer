      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nThe Beatrice Cheese, Inc. facility located in Fredericksburg, Iowa is a subsidiary of the Con Agra Corporation.  The facility produces cheese products in various forms.  As part of the cheese making process, both heating and cooling of ingredients and process areas is required.  Cooling is achieved through the use of an ammonia refrigeration system.  The system feeds ammonia to brine and glycol heat exchangers, coolers, freezers and jacket-cooled silos.\n\nAmmonia contained within the refrigeration system is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At Beatrice Cheese the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\nBeatrice Cheese is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the Waterloo Hazmat team.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nBeatrice Cheese, Fredericksburg, Iowa facility has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single largest container over a ten minute period, assuming worst case meteorological conditions).  Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \n\nA release represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the design of system components (they are designed to withstand pressures well in excess of normal operating conditions) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at the Beatrice Cheese facility.\n\nIn fact, EPA release reporting databases and indus"

A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA \"credible\" alternate release scenario was formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance. This scenario involves the postulate of a one inch diameter hole in piping on the roof of the facility (liquid return line from condenser).  This warm ammonia will readily vaporize and was modeled using EPA RMP guidance and modeled using RMP Comp.  Results of this credible alternative event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected.  \n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible alternative scenario is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nCon Agra is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Plant Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Beatrice Cheese, Fredericksburg, Iowa facility maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving ammonia.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\nAmmonia gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\nProcess safety information to document the safe process design;\n\nProc"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major ammonia release that could have had adverse effects on the public.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nIn the event that a ammonia release does occur, the Beatrice Cheese facility has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Waterloo Hazmat team. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact Waterloo Hazmat who would dispatch specially train personnel to the facility. \n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n\nThe Beatrice Cheese continually works to safely manage the hazards of ammonia to protect the community we serve and the employees working for us.
