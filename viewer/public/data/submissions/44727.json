The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility ,which is located at 400 South Main, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1 - 12,000 gallon tanks, loading risres,associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia tha can be stored would be 120,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alterative-case scenario, however since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulation.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", p"
