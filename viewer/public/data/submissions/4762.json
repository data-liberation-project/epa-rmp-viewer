The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nThe Na-Churs Alpine Solutions (Na-Churs) facility located in Marion, Ohio complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our ammonia storage system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use.  The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia.  The ammonia storage process consists of two above ground storage tanks (20,000 and 23,000 gallons) and associated piping, valves, pumps, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential failure of the 23,000-gallon storage tank (the largest vessel) filled to 90% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each ammonia storage tank to 90% of capacity), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.  Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be 0.7 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include:  day care centers; schools; a nursing home; private residences; and, commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities.  The residential population within this 0.7-mile radius is approximately 4,971 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential releas"

      "SummaryText": "e of ammonia through the transfer hose (i.e., caused by a rupture of the connection between the ammonia unloading station piping and the ammonia delivery tanker truck), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.  The release rate of ammonia from the 3\" diameter transfer hose with an initial operating flow rate of 1,490 pounds per minute was determined, using RMP*Comp, to be 4,350 pounds per minute (32.7 pounds per minute to the outside air).  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 0.3 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 1,310 pounds of ammonia.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be <0.1 miles.  The only affected public receptors under this alternative release scenario are private residences and commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities.  The residential population within this 0.1-mile radius is approximately 101 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law at the Na-Churs facility in Marion, Ohio.\n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility has never had an accident involving its ammonia storage process.  This accident history includes no events resulting in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n7.  The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving the ammonia storage system, it is Na-Churs' policy to immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Marion Fire Department.\n\n8.  Planned "
