SER has one covered process under the Risk Management Program (LPG storage); the covered process may contain any of three \"regulated substances\" at any time (butane, propane, or flammable mixture).\r\n\r\nThe SER Evanston Refinery is a small petroleum refinery located approximately six miles east of Evanston, Wyoming, in a rural area of Uinta County.  The closest residence is approximately five miles away.  The facility processes up to 4,000 barrels per day of light crude oil into gasoline. The facility was built in 1989 and operated until 1991, when it was shut down.  Silver Eagle restarted the refinery in 1996, and has operated it since.  \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\r\n \r\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances Handled\r\nSection 3: Worst-Case Release Scenarios \r\nSection 4: Alternative Release Scenarios\r\nSection 5: Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nSection 6: Five-Year Accident History\r\nSection 7: Emergency Response Program\r\nSection 8: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSECTION 1: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nSER is committed to the safety of its employees, visitors, and the public and protection of the environment in the operation of the Evanston Refinery.  In addition to operating and emergency procedures, the refinery has implemented policies for: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permits, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.

      "SummaryText": "esponse Program is discussed further in Section 7.\r\n\r\nSECTION 2: OVERVIEW OF REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nAs part of the process of refining light crude oil into gasoline, the refinery produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is a mixture primarily of C3 and C4 hydrocarbons (referred to as \"C3/C4\"), which is used as fuel, blended into gasoline, or sold.  The refinery also purchases LPG (either nearly pure propane or butane) for use as fuel or for gasoline blending.  The LPG is stored in two pressurized bullet tanks (TK-111 and TK-112).  The bullets are adjacent to each other and are connected by piping with manually-operated gate valves that are normally kept closed.  Therefore, for the purposes of RMP, the tanks are considered a single \"process,\" as that term is defined in 40 CFR 68.3.\r\n\r\nThe type of LPG stored in each bullet varies, and at any time the bullets could contain nearly pure propane or nearly pure butane purchased from a supplier, or C3/C4 LPG produced by the refinery.  Based on sample results, the C3/C4 LPG produced by the refinery is a combination of approximately 48% isobutane, 35% propane, 11% n-butane, 4% ethane, and 2% other liquefied petroleum gases.  All of the LPGs stored in the bullets have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4.\r\n\r\nEach tank has a total volume capacity of 714 barrels (29,988 gallons), though maximum storage is operationally limited to 640 barrels (26,880 gallons).  LPG is stored at ambient temperature, and operating pressure is dependent on temperature, but typically is in the range of 75 to 100 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), although it may go as low as 25 psig in the winter.\r\n\r\nSECTION 3: WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\nThe worst case scenario for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi). The worst case scenario endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel"

      "SummaryText": "in a process filled to capacity resulting in a VCE. For the SER worst case scenario, it was assumed that that the valves connecting the vessels were left open and the contents of both vessels were released and both vessels contained pure butane (butane produced the greatest off-site consequence radius).  \r\n\r\nThe worst case distance to a 1 psi overpressure endpoint from a VCE, based on a release of two full vessels of butane and as calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp computer model, does reach off-site.  The only public receptor within the worst-case radius is a normally-unstaffed pipeline pump station, which is located on SER property.  \r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 68.25, no active mitigation measures were considered.  In addition, no administrative controls or passive mitigation were considered for this scenario.  \r\n\r\nSECTION 4: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were considered, including a pull-away explosion, piping break, pump releases due to seal failure, and overpressurization or venting through relief valves.  The alternative release scenario selected is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquids (primarily butane) from a 6 inch piping leak. Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within 10 minutes.  The distance to a 1 psi overpressure endpoint from a VCE, based on the alternative release scenario and as calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp computer model, does reach off-site.  The only public receptor within the worst-case radius is the same normally-unstaffed pipeline pump station that was described in the worst case release scenario above.  \r\n\r\nNo active or passive mitigation systems were considered for this alternative release scenario.  \r\n\r\nSECTION 5: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nSER has implemented an accidental release prevention program containing the following elements (with Standard Policies developed defining requirements for each element):\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: Standard Policy"

      "SummaryText": "10.1 addresses employee participation.  Employees assist in the development of process safety information (PSI), conduct of process hazard analysis (PHAs), development and review of operating procedures, management of change (MOC), pre-start up safety reviews (PSSR), incident investigation, and emergency response planning. Employees have access to information developed under the PSM and RMP rules through a shared drive available to all employees and an onsite library.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI):  Standard Policy 10.2 addresses process safety information.  SER will ensure that when any process equipment is ordered the following information is requested from the vendor:\r\n\u00bf\tEquipment Spec sheet\r\n\u00bf\tU1A form or equivalent\r\n\u00bf\tOriginal Engineering Calculations\r\n\u00bf\tVendors installation and repair manual\r\n\u00bf\tAll associated equipment drawings\r\n\u00bf\tEnsure that the equipment is fit for the service that it is in.\r\n\r\nSafety Data Sheets (SDS) or other relevant information about the hazards of the chemicals in the process are kept with the PSI, as are the safe upper and lower limits of the processes described in the Consequences of Deviation tables.  To ensure that all PSI is maintained and readily available for personnel that need the information, SER stores all PSI in the PSM database.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Standard Policy 10.3 addresses process hazard analysis conducted per PSM or RMP.  SER completed initial PHAs on processes covered by these standards and will revalidate PHAs in accordance with the 5 year revalidation schedule or sooner based on the complexity of changes per the MOC. \r\nPHAs are appropriate to the complexity of the process and will identify, evaluate, and control hazards in the process.  The process engineer reviews the MOC and decides if a simple PHA or What-If analysis is required.  The MOC Risk Assessment form determines which level of hazard analysis is required.  SER normally uses one of the following methodologies to conduct PHA's: hazard"

SER operation personnel and refinery leaders determine the scope of the operating procedures for each unit.  As procedures are developed SER determines the steps to perform the procedure correctly and safely.  All draft procedures are validated by at least two operators qualified in the process and go through the validation process. All SER employees involved with performing the tasks associated with any operating procedure are trained on the operating procedures.\r\n\r\nTraining: Standard Policy 10.5 addresses training.  All SER employees involved with performing the tasks associated with any operating procedures are trained as described in the Plant Operator Training Guide, which requires: assigning a mentor to each employee, providing each employee with their job training guide, and completing all training identified in the guide.  Training topics include the following prior to being considered qualified:\r\n\u00bf\tSER Safe Work Policies & Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tBasic Operator Topics & Tasks\r\n\u00bf\tProcess and Equipment Overviews \r\n\u00bf\tJob Specific Training:  Operating Procedures which include safety and health hazards specific to the unit\r\n\u00bf\tAffected-Level Employee Training\r\n\u00bf\tAwareness-Level Employee Training\r\n\r\nEmployees are trained on any design or MOC process changes prior to operating a modified process, as identified in the MOC Required Training document.  \r\n\r\nContractors: Standard Policy 10.6 addresses contractors.  SER has a contractor pre-qualification process, which includes a review of the contractor safety performance.  Before contractors begin work at the site, contractors attend a Site Safety Orientation and receive information about the Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) and the hazards in the areas they will be working.  All contractors who work in the facility must have awareness level safety training to the nationa"

The method used for the training is evaluated during the pre-approval process.  Contractor performance is observed and audited using a Contractor Safety Observation Checklist.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR): Standard Policy 10.7 addresses pre-startup safety reviews.  Upon completion of an MOC, SER completes a PSSR for all new facilities or any facility modification (or MOC) significant enough to require a change in the PSI.  The PSSR schedule is established by the MOC coordinator, with the assistance of the persons performing the PSSR.  SER selects a qualified team from each of the following departments: Maintenance, Operations, Technical, Management, and Contractors (if applicable).  The PSSR team validates that the equipment has been installed in accordance with specifications, and that construction was performed in accordance with specifications and the contract.  The PSSR team validates that the operating, maintenance, safety and emergency procedures are in place and adequate.  The PSSR team also validates all new or modified facility P&IDs been updated to show construction or process modifications.  The PSSR team also verifies that action items from the PHA are complete, employees have been trained, and safety systems (such as PSVs) meet proper criteria.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):  Standard Policy 10.8 addresses mechanical integrity.  SER includes all the following types of equipment in the MI Program: pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps (and other types of rotating equipment).  SER performs inspections and tests on the equipment identified above to insure the integrity of the equipment.  SER inspection and test procedures follow good engineering prac"
