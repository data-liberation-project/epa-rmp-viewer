It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements.
