The Dallas WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage\r\ncontainers. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management\r\nresponse team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts\r\nof accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Dallas WTP has prepared a detailed and\r\ncomprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to\r\nsafeguard both on- and off-site people. To date, we have had an excellent r"

      "SummaryText": "ecord in preventing accidents\r\nfrom occurring.\r\n\r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe Dallas WTP, operating since 1972, modified in 1992, and modified in 2008 is located at 16375 W.\r\nEllendale Rd. in the City of Dallas in Polk County. The plant, located on an acre of property, is about 1.2 miles\r\nwest of the city limits of Dallas. Water is supplied to the plant via Rickreall Creek from Mercer Reservoir.\r\nWater from the plant services Dallas and Ellendale Water District. Treatment processes used at the plant\r\ninclude preliminary screening, flocculation and settling, sand bed filtration and chlorination. The Dallas WTP\r\nproduces 8.5 million gallons per day (MGD).\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine in two, 1-ton steel storage tanks containing a maximum in each tank of\r\n2,000 pounds of chlorine. The facility has the capacity to hold two more 1-ton containers, but seldom does\r\nso. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the RMP regulation.\r\nChlorine gas is injected from chlorine containers into a solution that is used in a variety of plant processes,\r\nprimarily for final effluent disinfection. Gaseous chlorine, pulled from a storage container by an ejector, flows\r\nthrough chlorinators that control and measure the flow of gaseous chlorine. The gaseous chlorine is mixed\r\nwith plant effluent water, and the solution is distributed to several locations in the plant. Chlorine leak\r\ndetectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage area and in the chlorination room. Other alarms\r\ninclude feed and evaporator malfunction and low bulk storage tank weight. These alarms are annunciated at\r\nthe chlorine control panel, as well as, in the case of a leak an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on\r\ntop of the building.\r\nThe bulk storage tanks and the chlorinators are enclosed in separate rooms. Each room is equipped with a\r\nventilation system. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided outside the storage"
