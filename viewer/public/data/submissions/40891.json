ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nIn response to the federal Environmental Protection Agency requirement, and as stipulated in Section 68 of Title 40 in the Code of Federal Regulation, and the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r); this Risk Management Plan (RMP),  has been developed for the Nunes Cooling, Inc., Yuma, AZ  produce cooling and shipping facility.  The purpose of this RMP is to:\n* Increase the protection of public health and the environment by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling an acutely hazardous material (AHM).\n* Assist Nunes Cooling Inc. and the local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling an AHM.\nThis document addresses the proposed AHM system for the produce refrigeration process at the Nunes Cooling, Inc. facility.  The AHM to be used at the facility and for the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The devices that use and store this AHM will be the subjects of investigation throughout this RMP document.\n\nNunes Cooling, Inc. is located within the city limits of Yuma, Arizona, in a predominately business/industrial area, and is a produce pre-cooling, cold storage, and shipping facility established in the 1980's and in continuous seasonal operation since that time.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the closed loop system refrigerant for the pre-cooling and cold storage equipment and is the only acutely hazardous chemical used on the site in amounts over the reportable quantities.  The facility consists of approximately 52,500 sq. ft. of cold storage warehouse space and various types of fixed and mobile pre-cooling equipment on the approximate 9 acre site.\n \nThe risks to the community from this facility would come from an incident in which the ammonia normally contained within the refrigeration system was allowed to escape into the atmosphere.

      "SummaryText": "  The Offsite Consequence Analysis contained herein incorporates the worst-case scenario and an alternate release scenarios.   Events which were considered possible and able to cause a release of ammonia for the purposes of the Hazard Evaluation were: equipment failure, operator error, design deficiency, vehicular accident, acts of sabotage/vandalism, fire and earthquake.   It is expected that other specific events would have similar results as those listed above.   \n1. Mitigation of ammonia release is addressed as follows:\nA) System design and construction\nB) Administrative controls\nC) Operating engineer on-site daily\nD) Off-hours security service\nE) A release inside a building. This may involve closing the building doors.\n2.  Administrative controls and policies\nThe Administrative controls and policies to be used in the event of a release are contained in the existing \"Business Response Plan - 1999\".   The major topics covered by this document are:\nA) Emergency Contact List\nB) Emergency Action Team\nC) Notification Procedures\nD) Hazardous Material Inventory\nE) Site Plan, Facility Layout\nF) Personnel Responsibilities\nG) Evacuation Plan and Procedures\nH) Employee Training\nI) Employer Emergency Response Checklist\n3. Risk Reduction       \nRisk reduction steps have been, and are continuing to be, implemented by Nunes Cooling Inc. to minimize the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia, and in the event of an accidental release, to minimize the effects upon the community.   The essential risk reduction steps now in effect at this facility are:\nA) Regular daily equipment observations\nB) The weekly inspection and recording of equipment operating data\nC) Maintaining equipment maintenance records\nD) Maintaining records of previous releases and their causes\nE) Proper training of operators\nF) Mechanical and electrical system controls \nThese controls automatically maintain the correct system temperatures and pressures, and provide safety shut-down and pressure relief in"

Utility System\nThe facility is connected to Arizona Public Service (APS) and is subject to possible power failures.  The failure of a refrigeration system to operate during a power outage poses no risk of an ammonia release since loss of power simply stops the flow of ammonia within the system.   In the event of a post-earthquake fire at the site, firewater is drawn from the city water system.  The post-earthquake functionality of the city's water system thus depends on the vulnerability of the system to earthquake-induced failure, which is unknown."
