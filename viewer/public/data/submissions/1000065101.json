The Houston Chemical Plant's accidental release prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of operations from planning to operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to applicable standards and inspection is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system.  \n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called \"Plioflex\" rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Houston plant complies with all requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation. As detailed in site procedure HOU-SOP-0044 Process Safety Management Overview, the Houston plant manages all aspects of process safety through employee participation at all levels in the organization.

The corporate procedures for conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk include consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public.\n\n\n\n4) All operating procedures are developed, reviewed and kept current by personnel experienced in the operation of that portion of the unit or in that job or task.\n\n\n\n5) Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements and ongoing refresher training for experienced personnel on a frequency determined by individual need or on a maximum three-year cycle.\n\n\n\n6) The site Mechanical Integrity Program encompasses several functional groups of the Maintenance Department and includes written procedures for all maintenance activities as well as inspection and testing sc"
