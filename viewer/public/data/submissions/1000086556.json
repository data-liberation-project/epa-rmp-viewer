      "SummaryText": "COMPANY AND PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nKanto Corporation, Portland Manufacturing Facility (KC-PMF) was established in 1990 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kanto Chemical Company Ltd., Japan, a company which has been in business for over 58 years as a manufacturer of high purity chemicals and chemical distribution systems.  As a leading supplier of high purity inorganic and organic chemicals, KC-PMF is dedicated to leading the US semiconductor industry as the most advanced supplier of custom-made process chemicals and related services.  High purity is essential to KC-PMF's business.  This demand by industry for high purity requires advanced process equipment and processes that are provided for in a state-of-the-art, purpose-built facility designed to exacting standards established by KC-PMF's parent company. To meet these requirements, KC-PMF's process systems are for the most part fully contained or closed chemical systems, and all chemical handling and storage areas designed and built to achieve 100% spill containment with all floor drains connected directly to an OR-DEQ permitted Chaustic Waste Neutralization System.\n\n\n\nKC-PMF is located in the Rivergate Industrial District of Portland, Oregon.  KC-PMF began production in 1996, and includes both manufacturing/packaging and chemical warehousing capabilities.  KC-PMF's employees provide leadership to its vendors to ensure safety, quality, and customer satisfaction.  KC-PMF's employees are trained in applicable EPA-, OSHA-, and DOT- driven environmental and safety programs.\n\n\n\nThe processes covered by EPA's RMP requirements relate to the manufacture and temporary storage of ammonium hydroxide solution.  Other chemicals are also processed and stored on-site, some in similar volumes as ammonium hydroxide, but which are not covered by EPA's RMP rule.   The covered process requires on-site bulk storage of the precurser chemical anhydrous ammonia and the necessary process equipment to safely, and with high quality, combine i"

The latter is contained in on-site storage tanks from where it is subsequently repackaged into bottles, drums, Intermediate bulk containers (IBCs), and ISO containers.  In order to maintain a consistent supply for customers' needs, an inventory of ammonium hydroxide is maintained within the warehouse.  Since this storage is separate from the manufacture of ammonium hydroxide, it is considered a separate process for the pupose of the RMP rule.  The warehouse operations are limited to the temporary storage of fully closed containers and truck unloading/loading operations.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong, pungent odor, used largely in refrigeration systems and as a fertilizer, and also in aqueous solutions.  At KC-PMF the gas is stored under pressure as a liquid in an outside tank. During the (batch) process it is converted to a gas and dissolved in water to form ammonium hydroxide 29%.  Ammonia gas is an acute health hazard and can effect persons when inhaled and on contact.  The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) is 50 ppm, the NIOSH REL and ACGIH TLV is 25 ppm, and the NIOSH IDLH is 300 ppm.  It is considered a corrosive and causes burns to eyes/skin/respiratory tract  Exposures to high levels can cause blindness and may be fatal.  Lesser exposures may cause irritation to eyes/skin/respiratory tract and lungs, coughing and shortness of breath.\n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is a colorless liquid that is commonly found as household cleaner (as ammonium hydroxide 3%).  At 29% concentration it is used by KC-PMF's customers as an etchant or cleaner during the manufacture of silicon chips.  Although ammonia has a strong affinity for water, ammonia is released from ammonium hydroxide 29% and can affect persons in the same way as anydrous ammonia, albeit the airborne concentrations will invariably be much lower.           \n\n\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CONTROL HAZARDS\n\n\n\nA worst case scenari"

Additional presumptions include the poorest weather conditions relative to a release, and no allowance for engineered active safety systems.  The modeled worst case release for a release of ammonia would travel offsite and impact the neighboring community.\n\n\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed for each of the two processes covered buy the rule.  These scenarios are more realistic than the worst case prescibed, and allow for active safety systems.  A more likely (although still not probable) release of anhydrous ammonia would be from a transfer hose failure during delivery.  This release would be similar to a hose failure, or disconnection of the hose from the piping system.  This release could impact the immediate industrial neighborhood to some degree.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a spill of the largest ammonium hydroxide 29% container (1000-liter tote) inside the storage warehouse, as modeled taking into consideration containment within the warehouse, does not result in off-ste releases of ammonia vapors.\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION OF HOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\n\n\nTo prevent an accident related to the storage of any chemical KC-PMF has instituted a comprehensive environmental, safety and heath program, that includes management commitment, written programs, employee training, auditing, and accountability.  All personnel that transport or handle containers of chemicals are trained in chemical safety and handling, including OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.120 and DOT's 49 CFR 172.704.  Also the competencies of  forklift operators who transport chemicals are evaluated bi-annually.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia system was installed in 1999 is state-of-the-art and incorporates several layers of engineered protection.

Mechanical integrity and preventative maintenance programs compliant with OSHA's PSM rule ensure equipment is maintained and continues to operate as designed, and a contractor safety program ensures only qualified contractors are hired.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nKC-PMF has an excellent safety record, and to date there have been no incidents in the history of the facility that have resulted in a chemical release of ammonia with off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS HAZARDS\n\n\n\nExhausted anhydrous ammonia, including that resulting from activation of a pressure relief valve, are routed to scrubbers that utilize ammonia's affinity for water to reduce the airborne ammonia concentration to below 25 ppm.  If a leak occurs in process piping, excess flow instrumentation will sense the decrease in pressure and increase flow of chemical, and automatically and safely shut down the system.

They are in radio contact with each other.  As an added precaution, the area around the delivery truck and bulk tank is secured and off limits to everyone except the employees directly involved in the transfer, and area monitored by CCTV.\n\n\n\nThe storage warehouse was built in 1998 to receive incoming non-bulk (bottles, pails, drums) precursor chemicals, and to temporarily store and ship customers' products, either in non-bulk containers or in IBCs (totes).

HAZMAT certification that can be activated in emergency response situations. Because of the comprehensiveness of this training, both small and large spills and releases may be immeditely dealt with.\n\n\n\nAmmonia system operators are specially trained to take limited energency actions to prevent a release from escalating (such as close a valve or shut down the process via Emergency Machine Off (EMO) activation).  With the engineered automatic operation and shutdowns, and ability for limited operator actions, a sustained and on-going ammonia release is highly unlikely.\n\n\n\nFor large, uncontrolled spills or releases the facility relies upon response and assistance from the Portland Fire Bureau HAZMAT team and HAZMAT response contractors (already pre-selected).  While these services have to date never been necessary, the partnership and preplans with the fire bureau and contractors are in place should the services be required.  Drills continue to be routinely conducted, some of which involve the participation of the fire bureau and the emergency response contractors.  Emergency plans at the facility have been developed with the input from the outside responders to ensure a smooth, coordinated response, mitigation, and recovery from an emergency should one occur."
