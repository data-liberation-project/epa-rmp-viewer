      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for RMP Submission to EPA\nCity of Lompoc Water Treatment Plant\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Lompoc Water Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass treatment of municipal potable water.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used for disinfection of the municipal potable water supply.  The maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 8,000 pounds at present.  (If necessary, the inventory can be increased up to 12,000 pounds of chlorine to accommodate public health needs.)\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables and/or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the two chosen scenarios the worst case scenario and the alternative scenario.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine in the disinfection process.  In this scenario 2000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-centimeter deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Fo"

      "SummaryText": "r this scenario, the released quantity has not been limited by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l).\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe selected alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a vapor release from a break in the flexible 3-16-inch tubing.  Since the system is under vacuum, a break alone would result in only a small release of chlorine gas from the tubing downstream of the regulator and upstream of the break.  However, if the break occurred and was accompanied by failure of the vacuum regulator, a release could occur from a valve.  The opening would be about 3/16-inch and potentially 5 lbs of chlorine per minute could be released.  This scenario would result in the release inside the chlorine building.  We conservatively assume the duration of the release is 30 minutes.  The leak detectors would notify an operator and the automatic controls would activate the emergency scrubber.  Standby help would arrive within minutes.  The leak would more likely be 15 minutes, the estimated maximum response time from detection and alarm to securing the leak.\nA caustic scrubber is activated that can neutralize 1 ton of chlorine in 2 hours and reduce concentrations to less than 1 part per million (ppm) in 3 hours.  Assuming 99.9 percent efficiency on the scrubber, we estimate that 0.2 pounds of chlorine would be released in 30 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l of chlorine is less than 0.1 miles.  This is the minimum distance on the reference tables.  We anticipate that the release will not go offsite and there will be no impacts.\n4.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLompoc Water Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on April 30, 1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lompoc Water Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLompoc Water Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLompoc Water Treatment Plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment t"
