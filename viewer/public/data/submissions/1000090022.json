Watco, LLC is committed to maintaining the high levels of safety and operational performance of its rail yard. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Watco, LLC rail yard receives, stores and ships butane, isobutane, propane and propylene via rail tank cars at its rail yard. Propane and propylene are blended.  There is no operation that involves the product in the railcars therefore there is no actual process that is carried out on site.\n\n\n\nToxics:\n\n\n\nThere are no listed toxic substances above EPA threshold quantitates.\n\n\n\nFlammables:\n\n\n\nButane (CAS 106-97), Isobutane (CAS 75-28-5), Propane (CAS 74-98-6) and Propylene (CAS 115-07-1).  Propane and Propylene are stored in railcars as a mixture.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help the railyard effectively manage the potential hazards posed by this product to its employees, the community and the environmental by our storage of these substances.  The following is a summary of the accidental release prevention programs in place for the covered process at the facility. The facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management plan (RMP) regulations and classed as a Program Level 3. This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\n\n\nTeam members are trained on the requirements of the PSM Manual for the Propylene/Butane Storage and have been included in the Facility Risk Assessment for the Storage Operation.  Each morning a Job Briefing is held with the team on what operations will be conducted during the shift that day and any recognized and"

Job Briefings and/or Job Safety Analysis are documented on the Watco Job Briefing and/or JSA/Risk Assessment Forms which are then available for review by any visitors to the facility. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\n\n\nThe process safety information for the WIRP railcar storage of Propylene/Butane includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals stored in the railcars at the Watco WIRP facility. This information shall be provided by P66 Wood River Refinery in the form of current Safety Data Sheets (SDS) meeting the requirements of 29CFR1910.1200(g) for each of the products. The current SDS's shall be maintained in the SDS Binder located in the facility operations office.  As there is no process involving the Propylene/Butane railcars within the WIRP facility there is no information pertaining to the technology of the process required. \n\n\n\nEquipment used in the operation are railcars that are built to AAR requirements based on the railcar specifications in effect as of the date built. Railcars that are used for the storage of Propylene/Butane are Pressure type railcars that are DOT105 and/or DOT112 railcars. Railcar specification sheets for applicable railcars are included in the appendix of the PSM Manual. The build dates are stenciled on the side of the railcar located just to the left of and below the Railcar Qualification Stencil. The DOT specification is located just above the Qualification Stencil located on each side of the railcar.  Qualification Stencils are visually checked for ensuring that all dates are current and within the qualification due dates for those railcars being used for the Propylene/Butane storage for the Watco WIRP customer, P66 Wood River Refinery. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis:\n\n\n\nAs this is a Propylene/Butane Railcar Storage \"ONLY\" ope"

The Site Manager conducts daily, when on duty, visual inspections of the railcars in storage to visually verify there is no evidence of tampering, product leak or release of any magnitude of product stored in the railcars within the facility.  \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that should a leak occur on a loaded railcar, it would in all probability occur at one of the product or vapor valves not being tightened to the appropriate tool tight condition as per 49CFR173.31(d)(1)(iv). In the event a leak is discovered by and/or reported to the Watco WIRP Site Manager, he will immediately notify the customer, P66 Wood River Refinery, of the railcar number and the condition so appropriate action can be taken to have the leak secured. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nThe Watco WIRP facility is a switching yard and is operated through the Watco Transportation Services LLC. division. All switching operations are conducted as per FRA (Federal Railroad Association), GCOR (General Code of Operating Rules), and ABTH (Air Brake Train Handling) regulations in addition to Watco SSI's (Special System Instructions) and any current General Orders for Watco Switching Operations.

      "SummaryText": "co WIRP Site Manager and Divisional Safety Manager will review the PSM Manual every 5 years at a minimum to verify that the procedures and practices as described in the PSM Manual and per the standard are adequate and being followed.  All findings during the audit of the covered storage operation shall be documented, corrective actions identified during the audit, and create an action plan to correct deficiencies in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nNo fires or loss of containment within last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nWatco WIRP has an Emergency Action Plan for the facility that identifies all anticipated emergencies that can be reasonably expected to occur. All facility personnel are trained on the Emergency Action Plan and expected team member responses to the identified emergencies. The team at the Watco WIRP facility are not subject to the hazardous waste and response provisions contained in 29CFR1910.120(a), (p) and (q), also known as the HAZWOPER regulations, as the team do not participate in clean-up operations but use 3rd party contractors.\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that should a leak occur on a loaded railcar, it would in all probability occur at one of the product or vapor valves not being tightened to the appropriate tool tight condition as per 49CFR173.31(d)(1)(iv).  In the event a leak is discovered by and/or reported to the Watco WIRP Site Manager, he will immediately notify the customer, P66 Wood River Refinery, of the railcar number and the condition so appropriate action can be taken to have the leak secured. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Watco, LLC facility is coordinated with the Wood River Fire Department and the Madison County Local Emergence Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee. The facility will conduct periodic reviews and orientation with local responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
