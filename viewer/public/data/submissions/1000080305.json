Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nHarcros Chemicals Inc. is committed to the safe operation of its plants for our employees, the public, and the environment.  We have demonstrated this commitment through a system of management practices, which help to ensure safe operations at this facility.  The Risk Management Program is a part of our system, which helps us manage risks.  The requirements of the Risk Management Program can be found in the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Program (the RMP Rule).  \n\n\n\nAt this facility, we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, which are hazardous substances.  The same properties that make ethylene oxide and propylene oxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  Harcros Chemicals implements controls to help prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  If a release were to occur, we will determine for each situation whether evacuation of our employees is required.  Public and private response agencies will be notified and we will assist them in their response activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nEthylene oxide and propylene oxide are received by rail car.  The chemicals are transferred to reactors where they are consumed in the process to make less hazardous commerc"

The use of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in this process are subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The process that uses ethylene oxide and propylene oxide is not only subject to the Risk Management Program Rule but is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The following addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHarcros Chemicals encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Employee participation ranges from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as members of a process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Information created as part of our plant accident prevention program is available to all employees.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nHarcros Chemicals maintains a variety of technical documents and information concerning process chemicals and equipment, which is essential to an effective process safety management program and to process hazard analyses.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response, is included in Safety Data Sheets.

Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The process hazard analysis is conducted by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process and makes recommendations for improvements.  All approved mitigation improvements are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures are prepared and used to address various modes of process operations such as start up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shut down, normal shut down, and startup of a new process.  Procedures are reviewed periodically and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nEach employee involved with operating the process is trained in an overview of the process, the standard operating procedures, and the properties of the chemicals used.  New operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years.  All training is documented including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nHarcros Chemicals has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of the work place, (4) understand what they should do in an emergency, and (5) understand the site safety rules, including notifying Harcros Chemicals pe"

This is accomplished by completing a contractor safety checklist and providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency action plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning any work.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review is done for new or modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHarcros Chemicals has practices and written procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition.  Maintenance employees involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment are provided an overview of the process and its hazards.  Training is also provided in the procedures applicable to employees' job tasks to assure employees can perform tasks in a safe manner.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practice\n\nHarcros Chemicals has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of entry and exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of residual ethylene oxide and propylene oxide before equipment is opened, (4) a permit procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit procedure to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with personnel training, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n"

Incident investigations are initiated as soon as possible after the incident but no later than 48 hours after the incident.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consists of persons knowledgeable of the process and other persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  Responsibilities are assigned to assure recommendations developed to address investigation findings are followed through and documented.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help assure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Finding of deficiencies in the program are documented and corrected.\n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThrough process safety management, the hazards associated with the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide process are managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to covered processes at Harcros Chemicals.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Harcros Chemicals has safety features on the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide process to help contain a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.
