      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Nestle Pizza Division facility in Little Chute, WI, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia). This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system. This system uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  An electronic training database is used to ensure all personnel receive applicable training. \n\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the Little Chute Fire Department and LEPC (Outagamie County Emergency Coordinator) in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\n\nNestle manufactures frozen pizza products at the Little Chute, WI, plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 31141.   Nestle has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the, Little Chute, WI, plant \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf ammonia. The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades. \n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 175,500 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989. Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities. Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrati"

The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThis facility is regulated under PSM, and has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, Nestle's ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \n\nThere are several key aspects of the prevention program:\n\n1. The facility employs a dedicated and full-time PSM coordinator to ensure the facility\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs program elements are in compliance and procedures are being followed.\n\n2. Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\n\n3. There is a plant-wide ammonia detection system that alerts utility personnel which is staffed continuously.\n\n4. Most of the ammonia pipe work is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release.\n\n5. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n\n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History\n\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: June 11, 2004 - June 10, 2009.  There have been zero accidental releases at the Little Chute facility according to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\n\n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan, including, but not limited to, steps to address the following topics:\n\n oAccidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous"
