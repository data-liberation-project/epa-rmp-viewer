(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nONEOK owns and operates a natural gas liquids (NGL) fractionation plant and underground cavern storage facility located near Bushton, KS.  The Bushton Fractionator receives raw natural gas liquids via pipeline, which are then fractionated into various products.  These products include ethane/propane (E/P mix), propane, iso-butane, normal butane, and 14# gasoline.  The storage facility receives products from the fractionator as well as from incoming pipeline and stores the substances in underground storage caverns.  From the storage caverns, products are sent to customers via outgoing pipeline.  Additionally, propane is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  The RMP flammable substances and mixtures stored or processed at the facility are E/P mix, propane, iso-butane, normal butane, refinery-grade butane, Y-Grade (raw feed), and 14# Gasoline.  There are no toxic substances "

The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Bushton Fractionator and Underground Storage Facility is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Providing overpressure relief valves on all pressurized vessels.\n\n-    Providing level transmitters and alarms on all vessels to help prevent overfilling.\n\n-    Conducting preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical   Integrity program to help ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \n\n-    Ensuring hydrocarbon vapor is removed and burned by installing degassifiers at the north and south brine systems.\n\n-    Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors throughout the gas plant and at every well in the storage facility.\n\n-    Minimizing the potential for a catastrophic event by providing a utility water system th"

This incident occurred in December 2008 and involved the release of a flammable mixture and one on-site injury.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Emergency Response Program\n\n    \n\n    The facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the Ellsworth and Rice County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Ellsworth and Rice County Sheriff Departments and the Bushton Fire Department.  The Bushton Plant Manager or Manager, Storage Operations is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions depending on where they occur within the facility.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n    \n\n\n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    \n\n    Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
