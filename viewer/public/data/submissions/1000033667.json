The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been filed with the USEPA as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  In addition, a RMP has been filed with the cognizant Administering Agency, Sutter County Emergency Management, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations at 19 CCR Sections 2735 - 2785.  This is an initial submission as required by Federal and California regulations.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe S&P/D-10 Receiving facility is located at 896 O Banion Road, Yuba City, CA in Sutter County, and uses anhydrous ammonia, an RS, to charge the refrigeration system.  The anhydrous ammonia charge in the system is greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  There are 32 full-time employees at this site.  There are up to 25 seasonal employees as well.  The plant is normally manned on the day shift Monday through Friday, and a telephone dial"

The entire plant site is enclosed by a chain link perimeter fence, and all gates are kept locked when the plant is not manned.\r\n\r\nBulk anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and charged into the high pressure receiver under pressure.  The ammonia refrigeration system serves the evaporators for storage room air and product cooling.  The system is totally self-contained, and the only losses of ammonia are minor in nature, from periodic oil draining operations, minor valve packing leaks, and the like.  Additional ammonia added to the system to replace losses has not been required.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration process operates generally as follows.  Compressors raise the pressure and temperature of ammonia vapor to hot gas condition, approximately 150 psig and 140 deg. F.  The vapor is condensed to liquid in evaporative condensers located outside the building, transferring heat to circulating water which evaporates.  Fans operate as necessary to increase the rate of water evaporation.  The condensed liquid ammonia drains into the high pressure receivers. The liquid is transferred to surge accumulator vessels in the storage room bulkhead walls by pressure differential. Liquid level in the surge vessels is controlled by liquid level floats on the vessels.   In the surge vessels, the high pressure liquid is reduced in temperature from approximately 85 deg. F to approximately 20 deg. F, and reduced in pressure from 150 psig to approximately 33.5 psig. The liquid in the surge vessels (recirculation accumulators) feeds to the bottom of refrigeration coils located in the bulkhead walls. The coils remain in a state of full saturated liquid. The liquid ammonia in the coils absorbs the heat from the circulated air. The heated ammonia is then returned to the surge vessels (recirculation accumulaotrs) where the liquid and any formed vapor are separated. The liquid remains in the vesse"

In order to accomplish this goal, S&P/D-10 Receiving has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by S&P/D-10 Receiving are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nS&P/D-10 Receiving has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA requierments at 8 CCR 5189 covering the ammonia refrigeration process.
