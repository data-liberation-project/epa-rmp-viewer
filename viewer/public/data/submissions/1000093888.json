This facility is known as the Kenton Plant and is located on US Highway Route 68 South.  The facility consists of one unit that manufactures phenolic resins.  The facility also conducts warehousing and shipping operations to support manufacturing.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 60 full-time employees.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source ( 68.155(a)):\r\n\r\nDurez is committed to operating the Kenton facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best management practices.  As part of this commitment Durez has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Kenton facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection AgencyA\u00bfs (EPAA\u00bfs) regulation 40CFRpart 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule.  This also provides the public with a description of the risk management program at the Kenton facility.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP at the Kenton facility consists of the following three elements:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tA hazard assessment program to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).

Each project is thoroughly reviewed in an MOC or PSSR (for all changes or new systems) before approval. These reviews include HES, engineering, operations, maintenance and management personnel.  In addition, Durez requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees (including call-ins) with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment piping, and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nDurez goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release, the Kenton facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Durez utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Durez trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental release.  In addition, Durez works with the Kenton City Fire Dept., 911, BKP Ambulance Service, Kenton City Police Dept., and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.

The plant reviewed OSHAA\u00bfs fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.
