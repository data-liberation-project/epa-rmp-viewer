This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and eight (8) 31,000 - gallon railcars.\n\n\n\nPelham Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Butane transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58, manufacturer's instructions and Sunoco Logistics specifications.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Washington Terminal's Butane transloading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Pelham Fire Department and request their assistance.   The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team, but outside services may be called in to assist.  The facility emergency action plans are coordinated with the Pelham Fire Department and the Mitchell County LEPC. The Pelham Fire Department is aware of the system, available protection systems (site fire extinguishers, emergency shut-off devices) and Emergency Response Procedures in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Sunoco Logistics Pelham Terminal looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.
