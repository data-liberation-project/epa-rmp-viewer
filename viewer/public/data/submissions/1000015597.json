Monsanto Luling Plant\nLDEQ Agency Interest Number 1096\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nMonsanto is an agricultural company.  We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world produce more while conserving more.  We help farmers grow yield sustainably so they can be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment.\n\nTo facilitate these efforts, Monsanto developed a A?PledgeA? several years ago.  The Monsanto Pledge is our commitment to how we do business.  It is a declaration that compels us to listen more, to consider our actions and their impact broadly, and to lead responsibly.  It helps us to convert our values into actions, and to make clear who we are and what we champion.  One aspect of the Pledge is A?respectA?, which states: A?The safety of our employees, the communities where we operate, our customers, consumers, and the environment will be our highest priority.A?  Thus, MonsantoA?s strong commitment to chemical safety begins at the upper level of the corporation.\n\nThis commitment extends to MonsantoA?s chemical manufacturing facilities, including the Luling facility.  As evidence of this strong commitment, the Luling Plant received certification as a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) A?StarA? site in 1994, and has continuously retained this rating since then.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Monsanto Luling facility is located in St. Charles Parish in Louisiana at 12501 River Road, Luling.  The facility manufactures RoundupA? brand herbicide and ACLA? brand active chlorine.  As part of its operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of Chlorine, Formaldehyde, Phosphorus Trichloride (PCl3) and Isopropylamine (IPA) to make it subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule.  \n\nThis Risk Management Plan report is being updated in response to a change in facility cont"

Monsanto is also taking this opportunity to conduct the full five year review of the plan earlier than is required by law.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Luling plant is also subject to the provisions of the OSHA PSM regulation, whose provisions align closely with the major RMP prevention program elements.  Accordingly, the Luling Plant employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation to comply with these rules.  Some examples include:\n\nA?    A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at a minimum of every 5 years.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material, and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made, and priority is placed on implementing them in a prompt manner.\n\nA?    Our mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices, and other systems utilized in handling regulated materials.\n\nA?    Instructions have been developed to provide detailed actions for employees operating the equipment.  These procedures are developed and reviewed with active involvement from operating personnel, and are certified annually.\n\nA?    A change management system is utilized for changes in equipment, operating parameters, and personnel.  Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\nA?    The site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services. Our Contractor/Guest program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria, and open communication exists between Monsanto and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\nA?    Process alarms and interlocks,\nA?    "

      "SummaryText": "Area monitors to quickly detect leaks,\nA?    Water sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\nA?    Excess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow under certain conditions.\n\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no RMP-defined accidental release events.  The most recent event meeting these criteria occurred on November 14, 2002 when approximately 0.8 pound of PCl3 was released from a faulty meter.  As a result, one employee received second-degree burns to his forehead and left arm.  This incident, classified as an OSHA recordable injury, did not have discernable community impact. The incident was subsequently investigated according to established Monsanto procedure, and all corrective recommendations made by the investigating committee have been completed.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nIn accordance with the provisions of the RMP and PSM rules, Monsanto's Luling facility has a documented Emergency Response Plan that includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of events, including inclement weather, fire, and toxic chemical releases.  Personnel responsible for implementing this procedure are available onsite at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations. \n\nThe following actions take place in the event of an emergency:\n\nA?    DEP is notified immediately;\nA?    Plant personnel respond immediately; and\nA?    DEP determines possible community impact and takes appropriate action.  These actions could include no action, shelter-in-place, evacuation, or continual communications.  Methods of communicating to the public include a siren syste"

The ERT consists of 86 members; however, the number can fluctuate with personnel changes over the year.  Emergency response equipment in the plant is routinely inspected and maintained to ensure a state of readiness, and is summarized as follows:\n\nEmergency Vehicles\nAmbulance\nHAZMAT Truck\nFire Truck\nMobile Emergency Control Center\nRescue Truck\nRescue Boat\n\nEmergency Trailers\nHAZ MAT Trailer\nPCl3 Foam Trailer \nFire Fighting Foam Trailer\nAir Bottle Trailer\n\nAll of this equipment is maintained in the Fire Bay, except that the fire fighting foam trailer is maintained in the Emergency Equipment Bay (also known as the Project Warehouse).\n\nOther equipment is placed throughout the plant for quick response and includes (but is not limited to) fire hose houses and monitors, sprinkler and deluge systems, spill response kits, absorbent materials, Industrial Hygiene monitoring equipment, bunker gear, SCBAs and other equipment.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nOver the next 5 years the plant plans to continue to improve safety through continuation of participation in programs such as VPP, continuing internal initiatives such as the Behavior Based Safety program, as well as conducting audits required by PSM and RMP.\n\nThis brief summary provides some insight into the extensive system Monsanto utilizes to maintain safe operations.
