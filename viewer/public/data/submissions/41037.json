Some of these products involve the use of propylene oxide to produce hydroxy propyl guar.  Propylene oxide is both toxic and flammable.  \n\nBPP has worked very close with Huntsman Chemical, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, the Dalton Fire Department, and Midsouth Metal to insure that the system was installed properly and meets and complies with all local, state, and federal safety and environmental regulations.  The process consists of a tanker unloading system, storage tank, weigh tank and a reactor.  The storage tank has a storage capacity of 10,000 gallons; however, inventory controls and safety procedures allow no more than 7,000 gallons of propylene oxide to be stored at any time.  \n\nPROCESS SAFETY DEVICES\n\nThe following devices are used throughout the system to ensure safe operation and quick response if an incident should occur:\n\nSTORAGE TANK AND TANKER UNLOADING AREA\n\u00bf Concrete dikes and berms around both the tanker unloading station and the storage tank to contain any accidental spills.\n\u00bf The storage tank area is equipped with a foam system for vapor suppression and fire protection should an accidental spill occur.\n\u00bf Both the storage tank and tanker unloading headers are equipped with dry disconnect valves to prevent spillage.\n\u00bf The pump transfer system is equipped with an emergency shutoff to ensure quick shutdown should a problem arise during the transfer from the tanker truck to the storage tank.\n\u00bf A nitrogen blanket of 5-10 psi will be maintained at all times on the storage tank.\n\u00bf Nitrogen will be used to purge all lines after unloading.\n\nREACTOR AND REACTOR AREA\n\u00bf The reactor will be pressurized (low pressure) and inspected for leaks on each and every Monday.\n\u00bf The reactor is equipped with both high pressure and high temperature process control alarms.\n\u00bf"

      "SummaryText": "The reactor is isolated from all other production processes.  All electrical equipment located within the reactor area is rated for hazardous locations (explosion proof).   This eliminates any possible ignition source should an accidental spill or vapor release occur.  \n\u00bf The reactor is also equipped with a computer system that will allow reactor activities to be monitored from any computer screen in the plant (engineer\u00bfs office, plant manager\u00bfs office, general manager\u00bfs office).\n\u00bf The reactor area is also equipped with several explosion proof exhaust fans which would ventilate the reactor and prevent the buildup of flammable vapors should an accidental spill occur.\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY TRAINING\n\u00bf Employees have participated in all aspects of the development and installation of the HPG reaction system.\n\u00bf All employees are trained in the proper safety and handling procedures of the propylene oxide.\n\u00bf All employees involved in the use of propylene oxide have received training which includes:\n      - Classroom training and discussion.\n      - Written exam and testing.\n      - On the job training.\n\u00bf All employees have been trained in emergency response and evacuation procedures should an incident occur.\n\nLOCAL AGENCY WITH WHICH FACILITY\u00bfS ER PLAN OR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ARE COORDINATED:\n Name of Agency: Dalton Fire Department\n Telephone Number: (706) 278-7363\n\nRMP Validation Error/Warnings --- No Data to Report"
