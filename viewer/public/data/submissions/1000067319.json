The majority of its products are sold in both the retail and institutional market places.  Due to the frozen nature of the food products that are produced, Request Foods utilizes a series of coolers, spiral freezers and storage freezers to maintain the integrity of its products and raw materials.  The chemical that is used at the facility to perform the cooling and freezing of the environment and products is Anhydrous Ammonia. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\n\r\nRequest Foods is committed to maintaining safe manufacturing operations for our employees and the surrounding community. We follow all industry codes and standards, including the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68). Our priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.\r\n\r\nOur RMP program includes elements addressing:\r\n\r\n-Management System: An assignment of responsibilities of the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n-Process Safety Information: A compilation of manuals, designs, information, etc. of refrigeration components that inform employees and contractors working with the system.\r\n\r\n-Process Hazard Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\r\n\r\n-Operating Procedures: We maintain written directions for the safe operation of our process.\r\n\r\n-Management of Change: We review all modifications to the process to ensure they will not change the safety of our operation.\r\n\r\n-Prestar"

(See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\r\n\r\nRequest Foods looks continuously for improved safety in our facility through the Risk Management Program."
