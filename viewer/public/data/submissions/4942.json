General accidental release and prevention policy of Alliant Foodservice.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\nthe environment.  \nIt is our policy at Alliant Foodservice to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nAlliant Foodservice, 27000 Wick Road, Taylor, Michigan operates a refrigeration system utilizing\nanhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic\nprocess where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired\ntemperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation,\ncompression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the\nquantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are designed to\nchange the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process.\nThe ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure an"

This vessels normal operating level is 6,800 pounds of\nliquid ammonia,  approximately 25% of it's total capacity. Although the recirculator is capable of\nholding 27,000 pounds, this exceeds engineering controls which limit the liquid level.

The\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: Four screw compressors, one evaporative\ncondensers, one high pressure receiver, two recirculators, one liquid transfer vessel, one\nthermosyphon tank, thirty cooler/freezer evaporators, a floor warming heat exchanger and a\nsystem purger.
