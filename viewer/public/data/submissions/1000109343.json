This commitment is demonstrated by FP Lancaster\u0092s\ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program. It is the facility\u0092s policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such releases do\noccur, there are highly trained employees on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the\nreleases.\n\nThere is one (1) regulated substance present at this facility. This substance is ammonia\n(anhydrous). The highest expected inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) at this facility is 26,000\npounds (rounded to two significant digits for reporting purposes).\n\nThe facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part(\u00a7) 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The ammonia (anhydrous)\nprocess is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process\nSafety Management (PSM) Standard under 29 CFR \u00a71910.119. In addition, the facility is also\nsubject to the EPA\u0092s Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release\nprevention program that are in place.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nInformation related to the hazards of the ammonia refrigeration system installed at the\nfacility has been compiled. Prior to conducting the initial and subsequent hazard analyses,\nthe process safety information was reviewed and utilized in identifying and mitigating\nrecognized hazards. The process safety information was also used in the development of\nthe operating procedures.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nComprehensive studies were conducted to ensure that hazards associated with the\nammonia refrigeration process were identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology\nused to carry out these analyses was the \u0093what-if/checklist\u0094 approach. The studie"

These procedures address the various\nmodes of operation of the ammonia refrigeration system such as initial start-up, normal\noperations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal\nshutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is readily accessible to\noperators involved in the process.\n\nTraining:\nA training program is in place to ensure that employees operating processes are competent\nin the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive basic\nclassroom training in process operations, followed by on-the job supervision until they are\ndeemed competent to work independently. Refresher training on operating procedures is\nprovided as required.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nDocumented maintenance checks are conducted on process equipment to ensure proper\noperation. Process equipment examined during these checks includes pressure vessels,\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance\noperations are carried out by qualified personnel. Any equipment deficiencies identified\nby the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology,\nequipment, and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations are\npromptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modification of established\nprocesses are conducted as a regular practice.
