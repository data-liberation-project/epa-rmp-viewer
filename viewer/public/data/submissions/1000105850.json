To ensure this safety, we have a thorough accidental release prevention program that includes all aspects of our facility's operation, such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Our policy is to take necessary measures to prevent any potential releases of regulated substances. We have implemented a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) program to ensure the highest level of safety.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAt our facility, we specialize in producing agricultural chemicals such as phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizer. It is important to note that we handle one regulated substance, which is anhydrous ammonia. This chemical is specifically utilized in the production of granular phosphate fertilizer.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) \n\nAccurately documenting offsite consequences is crucial in effectively communicating potential hazards associated with stationary sources. Itafos Conda LLC has performed offsite consequence analyses in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines. These analyses were conducted to establish a practical emergency response plan and to inform the community about potential hazards. The EPA has received comprehensive information on release scenarios, projected off-site impact, and the estimated population in the affected area.\n\n?\n4.
