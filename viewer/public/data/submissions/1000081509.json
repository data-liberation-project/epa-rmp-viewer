Introduction and Policies\n\nNouryon is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for their employees, contractors, the public and the environment. As part of this commitment, Nouryon has established a system to help assure the safe operation of chemical processes at the facility. One part of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that is required by the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68. One of the requirements of the regulations is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which descriptions the risk management programs at the facility for review by the EPA and the public.\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Nouryon Houston plant stores regulated substances for use in oxylation, which chemically transforms those substances into less hazardous products. \n\n\n\nFor the oxy"

The Houston facility does not have any EPA RMP-regulated flammable chemicals. The facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and regulated under EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 - Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe hazards of the process operated at the Nouryon Houston facility are managed through safety programs developed at the facility. For ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO), numerous process controls such as sensors, alarms and interlocks detect and prevent hazardous upset conditions. Automatic shut-off valves prevent EO/PO from being added unless the process conditions are safe. Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank, unloading, and reactor areas to absorb leaks. Dikes are provided for the storage tanks. All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves, and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere. The EO/PO suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the facility to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials towards that goal.\n\n\n\nSeveral regulated chemicals-sulfur dioxide, isopropylamine and ammonia-were discontinued at the facility in a effort to make the process inherently safer by utilizing alternate process chemistry. \n\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards adopted by Nouryon.  These standards include:\n\n\n\n?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n?    Operating and maintaining the assets such that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a man"

Correcting findings identified in regular audits of the facility.\n\nNouryon is committed to environment, worker, and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if a release does occur, trained Nouryon personnel will respond, to control and contain the incident. Details on the emergency response program are outlined in Section 6.\n\n    \n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release, Nouryon personnel will respond by shutting down operations, and/or by applying water mitigation to absorb and dilute the release of water-soluble chemicals. As necessary, onsite personnel will be evacuated and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department and police will be notified to help handle the emergency and warn the public. Additionally, the facility has an automated system in place to contact potentially affected members of the community by telephone to provide communication of a potential chemical hazard.\n\n\n\n4.  Prevention Program\n\nThe Nouryon Houston facility is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and emphasis on safety has contributed to process safety.  The facility has had no RMP chemical release accidents over the last five years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases, as part of a detailed prevention program.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Providing preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program to ensure that loss of c"

Nouryon maintains an emergency response team whose members are specifically trained and equipped to respond to emergencies such as leaks, spills, fires, etc.\n\n?    Response is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community.\n\n?    Nouryon maintains a community emergency notification plan.\n\n?    Emergency response personnel are regularly trained to comply with federal, state, and local requirements.\n\n?    An automated community telephone emergency notification system is available to provide concise emergency information to neighbors if an event that could affect them were to occur.\n\n    \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement plans, which fall into three primary areas:\n\n\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis: Identification of potential hazards, and prompt implementation of corrective action are done in accordance with applicable regulations and as a matter of company policy.\n\n?    Incident Investigation: Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses are conducted and findings are shared across the company.\n\n?    Benchmarking: The facility continually evaluates its safety program and processes against the best in the world, with the goal of continual improvement.\n\n\n\nThe plant has received recognition by OSHA under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), including its process safety programs. As part of ongoing efforts to improve safety at the facility, several RMP regulated chemicals at the facility have been removed or substituted for safer chemicals. As a result of this, the number of RMP covered chemicals in use at the facility has decreased from five to two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Knowledgeable operators write or review operating procedures and are included in process hazard analyses. Employees attend monthly safety meetings that begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement. Operators are assigned to project teams to review and comment on new designs, to train on new processes and to train others on major process changes prior to implementation.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe facility maintains updated information regarding its chemical hazards, processes, procedures, and equipment, which is used by employees as needed to help them do their jobs safely.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nNew and existing processes, and any changes to existing processes, are examined using OSHA PSM recognized process hazard analysis (PHA).
