Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement plans, which fall into three primary areas:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis: Identification of potential hazards, and prompt implementation of corrective action are done in accordance with applicable regulations and as a matter of company policy.\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation: Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses are conducted and findings are shared across the company.\r\n\u00bf\tBenchmarking: The facility continually evaluates its safety program and processes against the best in the world, with the goal of continual improvement.\r\n\r\nThe plant has received recognition by OSHA under the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), including its process safety programs. As part of ongoing efforts to improve safety at the facility, several RMP regulated chemicals at the facility have been removed or substituted for safer chemicals. As a result of this, the number of RMP covered chemicals in use at the facility has decreased from five to two."

For ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO), numerous process controls such as sensors, alarms and interlocks detect and prevent hazardous upset conditions. Automatic shut-off valves prevent EO/PO from being added unless the process conditions are safe. Leak sensors provide alarms if leaks are detected and deluge systems are provided for tank, unloading, and reactor areas to absorb leaks. Dikes are provided for the storage tanks. All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves, and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere. The EO/PO suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the facility to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials towards that goal.\r\n\r\nSeveral regulated chemicals-sulfur dioxide, isopropylamine and ammonia-were discontinued at the facility in a effort to make the process inherently safer by utilizing alternate process chemistry. \r\n\r\n3.
