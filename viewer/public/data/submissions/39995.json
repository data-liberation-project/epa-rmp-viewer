Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Colusa County Farm Supply's Williams facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 5837 Freshwater Road, Williams, California, 95987 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000-gallon and one 20,000 gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 164,700 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight)  is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 200,000-gallon and two 100,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 3,000,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is  900,000 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to the Clean Air Act, the description covering the worst-case release scenario has been eliminated from the executive summary.\n\n4.
