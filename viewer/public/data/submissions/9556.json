The worst case release is\r\ndefined by EPA as the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest\r\nvessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  For the worst case release, EPA specifies the\r\nparameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its  toxic endpoint. \r\nThe alternative release is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario, such\r\nas a pipe leak.  \r\n \r\nUtilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 4.3 miles was calculated for the worst case\r\nrelease toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA regulations, the\r\npopulation is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic endpoints. \r\nThese population values are 53,398 for the worst case and 140  for the alternative release.  It is noted\r\nthat if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario, the population at risk\r\nwould be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of an elliptical pattern\r\nmoving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point source. \r\n \r\nThe use of chlorination for wastewater treatment has yielded enormous benefits in this County related\r\nto preventing the spread of water borne diseases.   The City, like virtually every modern treatment\r\nfacility, understands the value and risks of this treatment procedure. The City has an exceptional track\r\nrecord of no accidental releases in its history and remains ever vigilant in its attention to safety\r\nregarding chlorine.  The City supports t"

In service to the community, the City  has a history of adhering to proactive\r\napproaches for the prevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances. \r\nCurrent prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's\r\n(EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68\r\nregulations. \r\n \r\nThe Facility is located in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida and utilizes chlorine gas in the wastewater\r\ntreatment process.  The Facility maintains a semi-enclosed (two side walls and roof, open at both\r\nends), chlorination area and chlorination distribution system on-site.   For modeling purposes, the\r\nchlorine facility is assumed to be not enclosed due to the aforementioned  construction. Chlorine is\r\ndelivered to the central area and stored on-site in cylinders containing  2,000 pounds of liquefied\r\nchlorine under pressure when full. The chlorine facility holds a maximum of six (6) 2,000 pound\r\ncylinders. \r\n \r\nThe Facilities have an outstanding performance history in conjunction with the handling, storing,\r\nmaintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since the system\r\nwent into service in 1980.  The  wastewater treatment plant is manned 16 hours/day, seven (7)\r\nday/week, 365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe handling,\r\nmaintenance and operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The\r\nchlorination system is designed utilizing latest technologies and industry specific design codes and\r\nstandards.  The current emergency response"
