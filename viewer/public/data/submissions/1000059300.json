This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  The personnel at the facility work closely with our public emergency responders so that they can respond safely and appropriately to an emergency that may occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant is located 46 miles east of Rock Springs, Wyoming  and 4.5 miles south of Interstate 80.  The facility operates several processes including compression, dehydration, cryogenic liquids recovery, and hydrocarbon fractionation to recover hydrocarbon liquids from the gas supplied by multiple wells in the area.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue methane gas stream, ethane, liquefied propane, liquefied butane and liquid condensate containing pentanes and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not use, produce or store any reportable quantities of materials considered toxic.  \n\n\n\nThe plant does store hydrocarbons in pressurized storage tanks in excess of 10,000 lbs.  Using the RMP Comp program, the predicted radius of 1 lb overpressure is 0.5 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the 1 lb overpressure endpoint.  For this reason, this facility is considered a Program "

      "SummaryText": "level 1 facility under the guidelines of the RMP program.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases that did or reasonably could have caused offsite impacts in the past five years as described in the Risk Management Rule (40CFR68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. \n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations.    \n\n"
