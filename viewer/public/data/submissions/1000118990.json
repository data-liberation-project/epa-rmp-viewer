Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSchoep's Ice Cream Division Street Facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and action procedures.\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\nSchoep's Ice Cream Company, Inc. process Ice Cream Products.  The facility utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperatures of milk, cream, and ice cream at 514 Division Street Madison, WI 53704.  Ammonia, a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, is used in an anhydrous form liquefied under pressure in a two stage process.  The refrigeration system consists of a High Pressure Receiver, evaporators, compressors, condensers, vessels, piping, heat exchangers, and numerous types of valves.  Schoep's Ice Cream, Division Street facility has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) was updated in December 2024 prior to this resubmission. ALOHA was used to model the worst and alternate-case scenarios.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\nThe Schoep's Ice Cream, Madison, WI - Division Street facility has an emergency action plan that addresses the actions necessary in the event of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.
