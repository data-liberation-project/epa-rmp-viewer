This commitment is demonstrated at the Lake County Water Treatment Facility East by consistently meeting and exceeding, the many stringent regulatory requirements, and standards we face daily for water quality and safety.\n\nOur facility's primary activity is the treatment and disinfection of potable water.  Our current treatment technique uses chlorine as the main disinfectant.  It is delivered by semi-truck in one ton containers.  Once it arrives onto our property, trained and qualified employees follow simple procedures to safely unload and store the chlorine.  Using proper safety equipment & techniques, the cylinders are unloaded by crane from the truck into a specially designed enclosed storage room where they are stored until they are needed for the treatment process.  The storage and feed room are constructed of fire resistant materials and are designed to help contain the material in the unlikely event of a leak.  All material and equipment in the process are specifically designed and installed for the express purpose of handling the regulated substance.  There are also specially designed sensors in the storage and feed rooms that are connected to various alarms that are conveniently located throughout the facility to alert plant personnel if a leak were to occur.   \n\nIn order to meet EPA inventory requirements, we have no more than four (4) full containers on site at any given time.  Two (2) of these containers are kept on scales connected to the chemical feed process at any given time to ensure proper disinfection of the water our customers and their families consume. \n\nIt is our responsibility and commitment to our communities, employees, families, and environment, to im"

This is covered in our accidental release prevention program, which is part of our Emergency Operating Procedures and the plant's Operating and Maintenance manuals.  The program covers areas such as hazard communications, facility and equipment design, equipment installation, operating procedures, chemical hazard awareness, maintenance, and employee training associated with the various processes at our facility.  Our employee's participation and input have led to the refinement of these procedures.  As a result of the expertise of our employees and the procedures they use, we have had an excellent record with no accidental releases exceeding reportable quantities over the last fifteen (15) years.\n\nOur responsibility to safety is further demonstrated by continually reviewing options which may reduce risks; we have conducted a Vulnerability Assessment and a plant regulatory audit.  From these two studies, we have concluded that we will be converting our disinfection system from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite in the near future.\n\nUnforeseeably, if a release would occur, we are completely coordinated with Painesville Township Fire Department in conjunction with the Lake County Hazard Intervention Team, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel, to control and mitigate the effects of any such release.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\nName: Ken Stoneman\n\n\n\nSignature:\n\n\n\nTitle: Superintendent\n\n\n\nDate signed:"
