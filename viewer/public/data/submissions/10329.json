These regulations deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In this way we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as wells as fire, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs are in place to prevent potential accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage.\n\nThese safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels that are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary.  All information is communicated to all employees of John Morrell, Springdale through training and documentation.\n\nJohn Morrell, Springdale is a meat processing, and packaging company which utilizes approximately 32,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping areas.  126,000 Pounds of propane are stored on-site as a backup to the Natural Gas for emergency use as a boiler fuel.

However this scenario is highly unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n7 Worst case weather conditions are uncommon...\n7 The vessel is in a protected area clear of vehicular and pedestrian traffic...\n7 Industry standards for construction and quality control of pressure vessels...\n7 Safety relief valves preventing over-pressurization of the vessel ...\n7 Accident prevention programs in place  ...\n7 Mechanical integrity programs in place ...\n7 Emergency alerting alarms integrated into the process system  ...\n7 Emergency response and action plans in place at the facility...\n\n In an alternative release scenario under worst case weather conditions (Wind Speed (meters/sec) 3, Stability Class D), a 3/8\" equalizing line hit or ruptured on the High Side Trap could release 944 pounds of ammonia (Liquid Spill and Vaporization) over a 10-minute period before no longer posing a significant threat or hazard. The vapor could travel as far as .09 miles.  This alternative release scenario was chosen because of its more probable likelihood that it could occur.  This scenario even though potentially possible is unlikely because:\n\n7 Emergency shutdown procedures are in place   ...\n7 Inspection and rounds made daily on the process system to ensure safe operation ...\n7 Emergency response plan and refrigeration personnel on-site around the clock ...\n\nPropane Scenarios:\n\nIn a worst-case scenario that uses a vapor cloud explosion and an over pressure of 1psi, a tank containing 30,000 gallons of propane would release approximately 130,000 pounds of vapor over a 10 minute peri"

This scenario even though potentially possible is unlikely because:\n\n7 Administrative controls are in place\n7 Propane operating personnel are on-site 24 hours per day\n\nJohn Morrell, Springdale's accidental release prevention programs for ammonia and propane are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, American National Safety Standards, and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration 2-1992. Key elements of this prevention program are comprised of:\n\n7 Equipment design, installation, and operation of ammonia process systems (ANSI/IIAR 2)\n7 Emergency Response and Action Plan Program (OSHA 29CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, and EPA 40CFR Part 68.)

      "SummaryText": "ental release prevention programs for Propane are based on safe work practices as referenced by the Environmental Protection Agency/CEEP Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (40 CFR PART 68)\n\nJohn Morrell, Springdale has experienced no accidental releases of ammonia (Incident-Investigation-Qualifying) or propane.\n\nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA regulations for emergency action plans in instructions (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (1910.120).  John Morrell, Springdale has an on-site trained emergency response team and maintains a written emergency response plan that is reviewed annually. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Fire Department, Police Department, and area emergency medical facilities to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release.\n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews, and audits, John Morrell, Springdale continuously improves upon its process system, procedures, programs, and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment, and organizational changes remain consistent and in force. Through this initiative, we can ensure the utmost safeguards are utilized as it relates to its process system and programs for the overall safety and well being of the employees, facility, and environment."
