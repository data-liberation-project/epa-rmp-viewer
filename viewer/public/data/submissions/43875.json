As part of this commitment, Ohio Refining Division has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Ohio Refining Division and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Ohio Refining Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Ohio Refining Division.\n1.2.1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOhio Refining Division is committed to the safety of Ohio Refining Division workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Ohio Refining Division implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  Ohio Refining Division evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities and training, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders including the local fire department to help control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  Ohio Refining Division, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and the fire department have also established a system to use for warning the commun"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Division Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Division Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the division organization chart maintained by the Division Manager's staff.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the division process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Division PSM Coordinator.  The division emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Division Health Environment and Safety Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other division personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n1.2.2.\tThe MPC LLC Ohio Refining Division Regulated Substances\nOhio Refining Division is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Canton, Ohio.  We use crude petroleum as our feed material and make a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, asphalt, sulfur and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane.  Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 lb.  In total, we have thirteen process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.

These initiatives include safety meetings and a health and safety committee to promote both process and personal safety. All division personnel attend the safety meetings and the health and safety committee has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, safety and division management.\n1.2.3.2.\tProcess Safety Information\nThe Ohio Refining Division keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Ohio Refining Division are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written process safety information plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Ohio Refining Division has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) as part of the operating procedures.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, refinery evacuation plans and accounting for refinery personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the management of change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\nThe overall emergency response program for the Ohio Refining Division is coordinated with the Stark County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Ohio Refining Divis"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\nThe Ohio Refining Division primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team has considered offsite effects of potential accidental releases as part of all PHAs conducted since 1996.\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original desig"

The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n1.2.3.4.\tOperating Procedures\nThe Ohio Refining Division maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Ohio Refining Division operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n1.2.3.5.\tTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ohio Refining Division has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process unit. When an employee is assigned process unit operation responsibility they receive basic process operator training.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn unit process-specific duties and tasks.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n1.2.3.9.\tSafe Work Practices\nThe Ohio Refining Division has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other hot work activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n1.2.3.10.\tManagement of Change\nThe Ohio Refining Division has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n1.2.3.11.\tIncident Investigation\nThe Ohio Refining Division promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explos"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Ohio Refining Division management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n1.2.3.12.\tCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Ohio Refining Division periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Ohio Refining Division management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n1.2.4.\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe processes at the Ohio Refining Division have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Ohio Refining Division. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could"
