In addition, the Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  The Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one (1) additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  The Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.

The ERP is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the NGL extraction, LP-Gas handling and storage operations, the ERP will be followed. Activation of this ERP sets in motion a pre-planned series of events that notify all area emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies are notified on the 911 system and directly.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices:  The Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC):  The Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implem"

The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\r\n\r\nTraining:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:  The Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work."

      "SummaryText": "ach process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  The Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and a"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the Facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The Facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  The Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Because the processes at the Facility are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).

An overpressure of one (1) psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario for flammable substance release, was also considered for this Facility. The Alternate Release Scenarios would result in a vapor cloud explosion from the loss of NGL from the 30,000-gallon NGL surge tank or the loss from propane from the 18,000-gallon propane tank due to a four-inch puncture of a tank and a release of 47,350 pounds of NGL (as ethane) in 5 minutes or of 49,100 pounds of propane in 5 minutes. Using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosions could cause an overpressure of one (1) psi would be approximately 0.2 mile (1,055 feet) for the NGL and approximately 0.2 mile (1,055 feet) for the propane. These incidents could occur if a truck backs into the tanks or piping is broken off of the tanks in the event that a truck drives off while load lines are still connected. Additionally, these scenarios would also account for any potential releases from process piping including flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals. Any releases from vessels including drains, bleeds, cracks, seal failures, plug failures, overfiling, overpressurization, and venting would also be accounted for in these scenarios. As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques. \r\nMidcoast has discussed these potential flammable gas releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Rusk County, thereby further reducing the possibi"

(Midcoast), is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, Midcoast follows a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with Midcoast's recurring safety improvements. Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that Midcoast sets.\r\n\r\nThe Facility, located in rural Rusk County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (i.e., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from field gas. This Facility consists of a cryogenic processing plant (Plant I) and a hydrocarbon dewpoint plant in (Plant II). Plant I's cryogenic processing plant includes a front-end amine treating unit, a glycol dehydration unit, and outlet compression. As inlet gas enters the plant it flows through an inlet separator where pipeline liquids consisting of water and hydrocarbon condensate are dropped out and sent to condensate or produced water storage tanks. The gas from the inlet separator flows to the amine treating unit for carbon dioxide (CO2) removal. The gas then flows to a glycol dehydration unit. From the glycol dehydration unit, the partially dried process gas flows to a mol sieve regenerator for additio"
