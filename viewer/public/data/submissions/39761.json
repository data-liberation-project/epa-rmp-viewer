      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIntroduction\nJohnson County operates nine wastewater treatment facilities and thirty-nine pump stations.  Only one of the treatment facilities, the Tomahawk Plant, utilizes chlorine for disinfection.  Tomahawk is a 4 million-gallon per day facility serving the central Johnson County Kansas area.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the chlorine system maintained at the Tomahawk facility, referred to herein as the Plant.  The County has replaced other chlorine systems with UV treatment and plans the same type of modification for the Tomahawk Plant within the next five years.  \n\nPlant Description\nThe Plant maintains only one regulated substance on Site: chlorine.  The maximum storage capacity is approximately 18,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold of 2,500 pounds.  A description of the chlorine system is provided in this section.  \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe Worst case release scenario for chlorine was calculated as the loss of a single one-ton cylinder in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  Only passive control systems were taken into consideration, such as the containment provided by the storage building.  Engineered control systems, such as the scrubber, were not considered, as mandated by the EPA.  The conditions of the scenario, including release time and weather status are those provided in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Determination of the area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp modeling software developed by the EPA.\n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the chlorine would travel approximately 4,750 feet (0.9 mile) under the specified weather conditions before dispersing in the atmosphere to a harmless concentration.  Within that radius of the Plant, an estimated 2,806 persons could potentially be affected.  Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impa"

Potential receptors include:\n\n- One major commercial and/or industrial area\n- A major interstate highway\n- One recreational area\n\nThis type of release would only occur if the cylinder valve were broken off or the cylinder were breached.  Historically, there have been no recorded releases arising from thr failure of a fusible plug on a stationary chlorine tank (White 1999).  The likelihood of such an incident occurring is minimal.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case.  Engineered controls, such as the chlorine detection system, alarm and scrubber, are considered in the analysis.  The type of system failure selected for the alternative release was the loss of chlorine due to a break in the flexible tubing leading from the cylinder to the vacuum regulator.  The chlorine would leak from a 3/8 inch opening.   The leak would continue until the chlorine detection alarm sounded and the valve on the cylinder could be closed.  Because chlorine would have leaked into the chlorine storage room, response would be made by the City of Leawood Fire Department under an agreement with the Plant.  The time for response was estimated at 10 minutes.  Once on Site, the fire response personnel would enter the room in protective clothing and manually switch the chlorine feed to the unaffected tank.\n\nThe chlorine system includes a 99.999% efficient scrubber.  The alternative release scenario takes this scrubber into account.  Because of this the amount of chlorine released is only 0.0048 pounds per minute.  If it is assumed that the fire department takes 10 minutes to respond, a total of less than one pound of chlorine is released.  In Section 3.5 of the RMP submittal forms, the quantity released has been rounded to one pound for reporting purposes.  IN Section 3.6, the release rate has been rounded to 0.1 pound per minute due to li"

Within that radius of the Plant, an estimated 25 persons could be potentially affected.  Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis section.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\nA process hazard assessment (PHA) was performed of the chlorine system beginning with the unloading of cylinders (receiving) and ending with the chlorine in solution (chlorine injection).  A combination checklist and \u00bfWhat If\u00bf type of analysis was used.  General questions regarding the storage and use areas as well as practices and protocols routinely associated with the management of the chlorination system were addressed.  A copy of that checklist is included in this RMP.  Following the checklist and using process flow diagrams, each valve, line and piece of equipment in the system was assessed from the cylinder to the point of chlorine injection.  The valves and other points in the system where chlorine could be released are numbered on the flow diagrams.  The assessment is formatted in accordance with those numbers.  Compliance with applicable codes, consideration of potential failure, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system.  Comments are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment Section.  In July, 2004 the PHA was reviewed as part of the 5-year update and re-submittal effort. There were no findings and the equipment had not been modified since the initial RMP submittal.\n\nPrevention System\nThe Plant has an operation, maintenance, and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorination system routinely.

There are operation and maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on any part of the chlorination system.  \n\nAt the beginning and end of the daily operating period and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for loading, unloading and changing cylinders.  The SOPs are written and posted in the appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.\n\nThe chlorine storage area is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that indicate leaks.  The tanks are stored and used inside a building.  The storage and injection areas are separated.  Ventilation is provided in the chlorine feed room only when a worker is present. \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nPlant personnel are allowed and trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by turning off a valve.  Any release requiring an entry into a dangerous atmosphere or use of a chlorine repair kit is managed by the City of Leawood Fire Department.  The Plant has an agreement with the Fire Department, which is included in this Plan.  A complete copy of the Emergency Response Plan is also included in this Plan.  \n\nAccident History\nThere have been no accidents involving the chlorine system at the Plant."
