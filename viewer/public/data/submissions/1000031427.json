This program consists of process safety issues, which includes following information:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the standard operating procedures associated with all equipment and systems.\n\n- Procedures and programs to develop, maintain, and control key program elements such as process operations, equipment mechanical integrity, employee training, management of change, hot work permits, incident investigation, and contractor activity.\n\n - Initial and regular review of new or modified processes that include Process Hazard Analysis study and pre-startup review. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps \n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide 1-ton cylinders are stored in designated areas. The containers have fusible metal plugs designed to melt between 158 - 165? F (70 - 74? C) to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of exposure to high temperat"

Forklifts are used to unload and load the cylinders and are done one cylinder at a time.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe AOC-Rosenberg facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of all covered chemical processes over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and have access to a map identifying the exit routes. The Rosenberg Fire Department agency has a listing of the hazardous materials at this facility and a facility map identifying the production and storage areas for these materials. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAOC-Rosenberg constantly improves the safety of the processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and safety suggestions from the employees. There are currently no major planned changes to improve safety.\n\n"
