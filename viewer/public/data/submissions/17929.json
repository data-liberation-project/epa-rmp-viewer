The maximum quantity of propylene that can be stored at this facility is 400,000 pounds. \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has incorporated a company policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propylene storage tanks to 80% at 60:F.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 140,000 pounds of propylene from a 34,000-gallon rail car.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp\u0019, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 140,000 pounds of propylene released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.4-mile from the location of the rail car.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is a t"

Therefore, the propylene released would be limited to 8,200 pounds of propylene, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\nThe scenario assumes the entire quantity of propylene in the transfer hose and iron piping is released.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the propylene process. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Rail Terminal facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.

Rail Terminal facility, we handle propylene, which is considered a hazardous flammable gas by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propylene to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle propylene, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Gas Sales, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe facility stores propylene in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum amount of propylene stored at the facility is administratively limited to 80% of the facility capacity.  Propylene is delivered to the facility via rail cars and is transferred from the facility via pipeline.  The pipeline runs between the facility and a Diamond Shamrock gas processing facility.  The largest rail car typically unloaded at the facility has a maximum capacity of 34,000 gallons.  Access to the"

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of propylene.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n Employee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin Gas Sales, Inc., that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin Gas Sales, Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a propylene occur.\n\t\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.
