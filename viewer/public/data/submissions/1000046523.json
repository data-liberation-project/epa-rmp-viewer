It is bordered by the NuStar Terminal to the north, and an undeveloped area to the east. To the south is a 300- to 600-foot undeveloped area (property maintained as buffer areas between the active or developed portion of the refinery and adjacent land uses), beyond which is the Bayo Vista residential area. San Pablo Bay borders the refinery to the west.\r\nInterstate Highway 80 and San Pablo Avenue run north-south through the refinery property. The property is zoned as heavy industrial. Land uses to the northeast of the refinery are a combination of industrial and open space. To the east is primarily open space, and a combination of residential, light commercial, and light industrial uses are found to the south and southwest. The nearest sensitive receptor is a day-care facility in the Bayo Vista residential area, near the southern property boundary, south of the undeveloped buffer zone. \r\nThe refinery consists of refining processes and support units that produce fuels, sulfur, and petroleum coke.

These materials range in flammability from pentane (with a flash point greater than -40 F) to hydrogen (with a flash point of -100 F). Higher flash points indicate less flammability. Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions. For comparison, gasoline has a flash point of -45 F and diesel fuel has a flash point of 125 F. \r\nAs part of refining crude oil to motor fuels, some regulated toxic substances are generated in addition to the flammables. Hydrogen sulfide and aqueous ammonia are present at the refinery at quantities exceeding their regulatory limits. Hydrogen sulfide, with its characteristic rotten egg odor, is created in the processing units that remove sulfur and nitrogen from the refining streams. It is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas and its odor can be readily detected at concentrations below concern. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored at the refinery. As soon as it is generated, it is immediately sent to the Sulfur Complex for processing. In addition, minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide may evolve from spills of sour water. Ammonia is also created and treated by the same processing units. Ammonia is a colorless, corrosive, toxic gas with a sharp irritating odor. Its odor is also readily detectable at concentrations below concern. The SFR uses aqueous ammonia for nitrogen oxide emission control. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are hazardous principally through inhalation. \r\nThere are several other regulated substances present at the refinery at quantities below their regulatory thresholds, and thus not subject to RMP requirements. These chemicals include carbon disulfide, hydrochloric acid, vanadium pentoxide, and cyclohexylamine. In addition, the sulfuric acid stored and used in the refinery is not subject to RMP requirements because it does not meet"

The SFR processes San Joaquin Valley Crudes diluted with feedstock produced by the Santa Maria Refinery. San Joaquin Valley Crudes are heavy oils, rich in sulfur and nitrogen. This heavy oil must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels. In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce less smog upon combustion by cars and trucks. The refinery also processes lighter, sweeter crudes from overseas. Crude oil is brought to the refinery via pipeline and marine tanker. Tankers dock at the refinery's Marine Terminal, located at the northwestern edge of the facility.\r\nNumerous chemicals, materials, and utilities are required to produce useful products from the crude oil. Some chemicals, such as hydrogen, are produced at the SFR or supplied by Air Liquide, which operates a hydrogen Production Plant adjacent to the refinery.

It processes diluted San Joaquin Valley Crude into three fractions: naphtha, gas oil, and vacuum resid. The heaviest fraction, resid, is composed of very heavy hydrocarbons and is a solid at ambient temperatures. This material is sent to the Coker, where the large molecules are thermally cracked into smaller ones. These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels. The Coker also produces petroleum coke, which is shipped offsite.\r\nThe gas oil fractions from the crude units and the Coker are still too large for use as motor fuels. These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Unicracker Unit (Unit 240) and the heavy gas oil Hydrocracker Unit (Unit 246). These units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. Hydrocracking is more selective than thermal cracking. Olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during this hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds. Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of smog during engine combustion; therefore, they must be removed.\r\nThe diesel and naphtha hydrotreating units (Unit 250, Unit 2290, and Unit 230) remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating hydrogen sul"

The applicable program level is dependent upon the complexity, accident history, and potential impact of releases of regulated substances. The applicability requirements are as follows:\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 1\r\no\tFor the 5 years prior to submission of an RMP, the process has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance has led to offsite death(s), offsite injury(ies), or response or restoration activities for an offsite exposure of an environmental receptor;\r\no\tThe distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint for a worst-case release assessment is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\r\no\tEmergency response procedures have been coordinated between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response organizations.\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 2\r\no\tThe covered process does not meet the eligibility requirements of Program 1 or Program 3.\r\n\u00bf\tProgram 3\r\no\tThe process is in certain predefined North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code categories;\r\no\tThe process is subject to the federal or state OSHA PSM standards; or\r\no\tThe administering agency determines that the accident risk posed by the regulated substance in a process above the threshold quantity as listed in 19 CCR 2770.5, because of the nature and quantity of the regulated substance involved, requires the additional safety measures afforded by Program 3 requirements.\r\nThe SFR has both Program Level 1 and Program Level 3 processes.

The Health, Safety & Environmental Manager has the overall responsibility for the management of the RMP. The facility has developed a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit program (Policy 14.0-6) to help ensure compliance with the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and federal RMP programs, as well as the state and federal PSM programs. The California OSHA (Cal-OSHA) PSM regulation addresses process safety at industrial facilities. CalARP and PSM regulations are similar in their requirements. \r\nWhile Senior Management has overall responsibility for the management of the risk management elements, personnel who have the responsibility for the elements periodically evaluate the effectiveness of their program, through internal audits, and make changes as the need arises. Senior Staff also periodically review each program for effectiveness. Senior Management sets goa"

      "SummaryText": "HISTORY\r\nThe RMP regulation requires a listing of accidents for the past 5 years from covered processes that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The SFR has had one accident involving a covered process that met these criteria in the last 5 years. \r\nOn June 15, 2012, an over-pressure occurred on Tank 294 causing an approximately 20-foot separation in the roof-shell seam, resulting in the release of a combination of the natural gas blanket, hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulfide vapors. The overpressure was caused by a large volume of light hydrocarbons being directed to Tank 294 due to flow reversal in the line between Tank 267 and Tank 294.\r\nPhillips 66 promptly initiated its emergency response procedures, which included emergency response team members responding directly to Tank 294 and activation of the Refinery Incident Management Team and Emergency Operations Center. The Community Warning System (CWS) was activated promptly and all required agencies were notified. Representatives from the Contra Costa County Health Services (CCCHS) Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Division and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) responded to the incident and participated in strategic decisions made to manage the incident.\r\nThroughout the day on June 15 and 16, numerous actions were taken to mitigate the release and reduce odors. Representatives from the refinery Health & Safety Department conducted offsite monitoring using a RAE Systems Multi-RAE 5-gas meters. Additional measurements were taken by BAAQMD and CCCHS-Hazmat Division. Odors were detected in the surrounding community; however measured levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were below 2.0 ppm and hydrogen sulfide were below the toxic endpoint (TEP) of 30 parts per million (ppm). No injuries occurred as a result of the incident.\r\nAt 8:30 a.m. on June 17, 201"

In addition, guidance from regulatory agencies provides standards for the program elements. Any changes to the program are communicated through a variety of methods. Communication between the element stewards is encouraged and expected for changes that could impact other element areas. Changes are also communicated through the Management Chain to all parties affected. In addition, if the program change is significant, the changes will be communicated to all personnel at the refinery through any number of communication channels, such as the intranet, email, bulletin board postings, hard copy distribution, safety meetings, etc.\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe refinery has a number of safeguards that are used to protect personnel and property from the hazards of the covered processes. These safeguards were either originally constructed in the unit or implemented as a recommendation from a PHA, audit, or other avenue. These safeguards are examined during a PHA for their adequacy in detecting, preventing and/or mitigating any potential hazards of the process. If the PHA team determines that the safeguards do not adequately protect against a particular hazard, corrective actions are recommended.\r\nAs part of the PHA study, potential hazards and their safeguards are examined in a rigorous, methodical fashion for a variety of scenarios. The primary focus is on prevention of release. The following are examples of safeguards designed for prevention of a potential hazard:\r\n\u00bf\tExcessive pressure: high pressure alarms, pressure safety valves, thermal relief valves, piping/flange/equipment pressure ratings, water separation facilities, and safety valves;\r\n\u00bf\tExcessive temperature: high temperature alarms, manual shutdowns, and automatic shutdowns;\r\n\u00bf\tLow temperature: insulation and heating;\r\n\u00bf\tExcessive flow: high flow alarms, fail to safe position control"

It is estimated that approximately 42 pounds of hydrogen sulfide was released during that time.\r\nNo other accidents from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe emergency response program is described in a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which consists of organization, procedures, and equipment for an emergency response. This program addresses emergency responses for fires, explosions, releases of hazardous materials and medical emergencies. The ERP addresses coordination with local agencies and the public. \r\nThe ERP has been prepared in coordination with the local emergency response area plan (the Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials Area Plan).  In addition, the ERP contains a number of annexes, including the SFR Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan and the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan. The ERP is revised at least annually; however, it may be revised more frequently if any of following activities indicate the need for a change: applicable federal, state or local regulatory changes, the ERP fails in an emergency, significant changes in facility operation occurs, the emergency contact list changes, changes occur in emergency response equipment or procedures, or a review reveals a deficiency in the ERP. \r\nThe ERP is an important resource tool that includes sections on the Incident Command System, roles and responsibilities, alarm and notification systems, response procedures for specific emergencies, internal and external resources, training and drill requirements, medical surveillance for emergency responders and ERP review and updating procedures.
