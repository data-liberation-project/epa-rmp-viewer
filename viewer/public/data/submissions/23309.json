      "SummaryText": "Seymour Fertilizer\nBevington, Iowa\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\nThe accidental release prevention policy at Seymour Fertilizer involves, but is not limited to technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the ANSI K-61.1 - 1989 revision of the Safe Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, as adopted by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are adhered to.  Our emergency response policy involves the emergency response services available in our community and is part of the Warren County Emergency Response Plan.\n\nThis facility is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia storage tank with a total capacity of 18,377 gallons water capacity.  The storage tanks, eighteen anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks, risers for filling nurse tanks, and a vapor pump for transferring anhydrous ammonia are all parts of this facility's anhydrous ammonia operation.  The facility is manned during the season and is operational through normal business hours. During the off season all the tanks are empty or nearly empty.\n\nThe off-site consequences analysis includes two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as worst-case release and alternative release scenario.  The first scenario is defined by EPA and shall assume the maximum quantity of a vessel is released as a gas in 10 minutes due to a catastrophic break.  The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely accidental release of anhydrous ammonia caused by a transfer hose failure.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic failure of the tank releasing the entire 85,879 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The off site consequences were calculated using TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers.  The worst case scenario used EPA's recommended wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an F atmospheric stability class."

      "SummaryText": "A rural topography was selected as typical.  The distance to the endpoint was 2.34 miles. It is estimated that 340 people would be affected by this release.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed a 1inch hose breaks and leaks 2900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The EPA recommended wind speed of 3.0 meters per second with a D atmospheric stability class was used in this scenario.  Using rural topography and TFI's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Retailers the toxic endpoint is .64 mile.  The population with in that area is estimated to be 293 people.  The assumption is that the duration of the release is 2 minutes because equipment, excess flow valves, and human intervention will stop the leak.  \n\nSeymour Fertilizer has had no anhydrous ammonia leaks within the past five years. \n\nThe key elements in Seymour Fertilizer's accident prevention plan include:\n1. The anhydrous ammonia system adheres to the laws and regulations that are based on the 1989 revision of the ANSI K61.1 adopted in 1990 by the State of Iowa.\n2. Annual training is required of all personnel on handling, transferring, or transporting anhydrous ammonia.  The training consists of a video describing the properties of ammonia, safe handling practices, first aid, and emergency response. Hands-on training is done at the riser with demonstration and observation as the method of testing.\n3. Annual inspections by IDALS fertilizer inspectors include safety equipment, tanks, and handling equipment.\n4. Use of proper anhydrous ammonia personal protective equipment and safety equipment.\n5. Changes are made in the system when necessary or when required by regulation change."
