It is Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 6001 Snow Road.  Bakersfield is the closest city to the Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC facility.  The plant was constructed in 1970.  The refrigeration system has been upgraded several times, with the last modification completed in 2000. \n\nAt Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC, anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system which provides process cooling for the cold storage rooms.  The system consists of a high pressure receiver, three evaporative condensers, five compressors, a glycol chiller, hydro"

The recirculation accumulators and flooded evaporators provide cooling to the majority of the cold storage rooms, the pre-cooler rooms and the fumigation chamber.  The loading dock and the remaining cold storage rooms are cooled by the glycol chiller and evaporators. In the bin hydrocooler, fresh water is pumped over the refrigeration coils to chill the water before the water contacts the fruit.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be \u00bfpumped down\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 60,200 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\u00bf An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00bf Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and imple"
