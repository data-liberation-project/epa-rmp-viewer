It is Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC?s policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC?s objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 6001 Snow Road.  Bakersfield is the closest city to the Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC facility.  The plant was constructed in 1970.  The refrigeration system has been upgraded several times, with the last modification completed in 2000. \n\nAt Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC, anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system which provides process cooling for the cold storage rooms.  The system consists of a high pressure receiver, three evaporative condensers, five compressors, a glycol chiller, hydro"

      "SummaryText": "cooler accumulator and refrigeration coils, and numerous recirculation accumulators and evaporators.  The recirculation accumulators and flooded evaporators provide cooling to the majority of the cold storage rooms, the pre-cooler rooms and the fumigation chamber.  The loading dock and the remaining cold storage rooms are cooled by the glycol chiller and evaporators. In the bin hydrocooler, fresh water is pumped over the refrigeration coils to chill the water before the water contacts the fruit.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 60,200 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n? An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n? Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n? Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and imple"

Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n? A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n? Pre-startup safety reviews are performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n? Audits are conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the RMP regulations.\n\n? Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n? A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n? Hot work permits are issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system.\n\n? A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, Bakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBakersfield Cold & Dry Storage, LLC has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release pr"
