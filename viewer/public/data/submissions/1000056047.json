      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2016 RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM UPDATE\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Arkema Inc., Houston, Texas production facility (Houston Plant) to reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.\n\n\n\nARKEMA POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are core principles at Arkema. Arkema is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reduce risks to health and the environment. Commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO. Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters.  Emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions and strive for continuous improvement. Arkema's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill Arkema's commitment to health, environment and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to assist our facilities to prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  Should an accidental hazardous substance release occur, we also have implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Program to promptly respond, address, and minimize the consequences of the release.\n\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES \n\n\n\nThe Arkema Houston Plant is located at 2231 Haden Road, Houston, Texas. The facility manufactures mercaptans and sulfides.  Two substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk management Program (RMP) rule, specifically Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and  Carbon Disulfide (CS2). These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP"

      "SummaryText": " applicability. Hydrogen Sulfide is manufactured onsite and is a raw material to produce mercaptans. Carbon Disulfide is a product produced onsite. Both are listed toxic substances.\n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Arkema Houston facility has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of 29\n\nCFR 1920.119, Process Safety management (PSM) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program addresses processes that handle the regulated substances. The accidental release prevention program includes the following components and activities:\n\n\n\n  ? In depth hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel;\n\n  ? Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n  ? Operators, mechanics and contractor personnel are qualified and trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n  ? A management of change system is in place to ensure that process-operating changes are managed safely;\n\n  ? Pre-start up reviews are performed to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n  ? Incidents are investigated and actions taken as part of a continuous improvement effort;  Routine audits are conducted to ensure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n  ? Storage vessels are designed and constructed in accordance with American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessel standards using industry-standard practices of construction. As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, pressure vessels and transfer lines are inspected and tested according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standards;\n\n  ? Critical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to "

      "SummaryText": "ensure proper operating condition;\n\n  ? Operators are trained to monitor level indicators and metering devices to prevent overfilling of storage tanks;\n\n  ? Relief valves and administrative controls are designed to prevent vessel and tank over-pressure;\n\n  ? Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to tanks and vessels by vehicular damage or sabotage;\n\n  ? A safety permitting system is used to ensure routine and non-routine work is carried out after identification and implementation of safe work practices.\n\n  ? A written employee participation plan is in place; employees participate in development of process hazard analysis and on the development of the process safety management plans; employees also have access to process hazards analysis and to all other required information.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Houston Plant has had one RMP accidental release in the past 5 years. In September, 2014, a Unit 180 process line failed, releasing less than 100 lb. each of H2S and CS2. In an abundance of caution, an adjacent plant was notified and requested to shelter in-place. In-plant emergency response actions prevented offsite impacts, as verified by onsite monitors at the time that were activated. \n\nManagement and facility personnel strive for continuing improvements in accident reduction. The training, qualification standards, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are key elements in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Response plan is maintained at the facility. The plan was developed in cooperation with civil authorities and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also includes documentation of proper first aid and medical treatmen"

The plan also includes a description of the training program for all employees in relevant emergency response procedures and procedures for review and update, as appropriate, of the response plan, to reflect changes at the facility and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nChemical safety has been a part of the working culture at the facility for many years. Chemical exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts as well as regulatory requirements.  Improvements to the safety program have include implementation of behavior based safety and additional accident investigation training.  Additional facility improvements include upgrades in the process control systems of a production unit and enhancements to security measures."
