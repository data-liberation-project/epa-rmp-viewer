The facility has an established, and tested, method for notifying our employees and surrounding community of an event which could, or would impact them.  The complex has standard operation procedures in place which define responsibilities and reporting requirements, depending upon the nature of the emergency.  The manufacturing complex has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to respond to fire, hazardous materials, medical and rescue emergencies.  Additionally, the complex is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid organization and can call upon all of their expertise, manpower and equipment if needed.  Linde Gas falls under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Our facility has adopted these recognized 14 components of PSM to govern how we run all our processes, not just those required by regulation.\n\nLinde Gas produces several final products at the LaPorte facility including methanol and syngas (which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  Methanol is sold into the merchant market as well as being a feedstock for the production of acetic acid. Syngas is separated into carbon monoxide and hydrogen and sent via pipeline to other facilities for consumption.  Linde Gas has one chemical which falls under the RMP regulations, which is propylene.  The total amount of propylene in the system is 55,000 pounds.  \n\nLinde Gas has conducted an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential impact to offsite environmental receptors and the public for an accidental release of a regulated substance.
