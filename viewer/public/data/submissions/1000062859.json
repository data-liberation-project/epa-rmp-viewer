The facility operates at the intersection of 131st Ave. SW and 38th St. SW and has a legal location indicated as the NW1/4 NW1/4 Section 17, Township 139N, Range 99W.\n\n\n\nProcess Description:\n\nTesoro Logistics operates the Belfield Gas Plant located in Stark County, North Dakota (ND). The gas plant is located 2 miles south of Belfield, ND on US Hwy 85 and ? mile west on 38 Street SW. The facility runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The site is manned 24 hours a day by operators located at the plant site. \n\nThe plant processes natural gas delivered from production wells. The natural gas enters the plant via gathering pipelines. The gas then flows through the inlet receiver process to remove all free liquids.  The inlet compressors gather the inlet field gas coming into the plant at between 10-50 psig and compress it to the H2S removal process before going to the NGL plant of approximately 450 psig.  The compressed gas is then routed through a Refrigeration Plant with ethylene glycol injection which seperates water and NGL friom the stream.  The rich EG is routed to the dehydration still column, which is heated from the facility hot oil heaters, to assist in driving off the water and regenerating the lean EG.  The gas stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor, which is condensed and sent to storage tanks and vapors can be burned at a Steffes Flare.  All flash vapors off of the EG flash tank are captured by process and routed back to the facility inlet slug catcher.  At the NGL plant outlet, the gas"

Extensive natural gas liquids (NGL) are produced from the NGL plant and are routed to two (2) pressurized NGL storage tanks.  \n\n\n\nThe extracted NGLs (Y-Grade, Propane, Butane and Natural Gasoline) are collected in tanks then transported, via tanker trucks/pipeline, for additional processing and/or marketing. \n\n\n\nProgram Level:\n\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 1 facility.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the range of the worst case release scenario.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and agency personnel will have a chance to tour the facility.  Tesoro Logisitcs takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nThe facility contains a fractionated NGL product storage and shipping process.  Ethane, propane, butane, and pentane are the primary components of the NGL inventory listed in the RMP rule.  Propane is used as refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n All of the chemicals above the RMP threshold are classified as flammable and not toxic. As such, only a flammable release scenario has been analyzed for the Belfield Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nThis is a relatively new facility and, therefore, has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has established and mainta"
