OxyVinyls, LP, referred to as \"OxyVinyls\", is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation and The Geon Company.  This facility, part of OxyVinyls Houston Operations is located in Deer Park near Highway 225 and is entirely within Shell's chemical complex.  The VCM Site 3 is used for storage of vinyl chloride.  From here, it is pumped by pipeline to the OxyVinyls Pasadena PVC plant where is used in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride.  This facility was constructed in 1980 and was purchased from Shell in 1986.  This facility is operated 24 hours per day and is staffed by a total of four persons.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a))\n\nOxyVinyls is committed to operating the VCM Site 3 in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyVinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the VCM Site 3.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the VCM Site 3.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the VCM Site 3 consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accide"

In fact, the VCM Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyVinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the VCM Site 3, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the VCM Site 3, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the VCM Site 3, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry"

OxyVinyls also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, the facility requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.  The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyVinyls' goal is to minimize impacts from accidental releases should they occur.  In the event of an accidental release, the VCM Site 3 controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled by OxyVinyls facilities.  OxyVinyls also has established a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office and at the facility to assistant workers, their families, and the public during and after all emergencies. In addition, OxyVinyls has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative combining the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area.  Participating in this organization ensures emergency response capabilities far greater than an individual plant can provide.

If the emergency extends beyond or could potentially extend beyond the plant boundaries, the Deer Park Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is notified and a statement of the type of emergency and any community protection factors are recommended.\n\nThe facility employees are active participants in the community.  As part of OxyVinyls' Responsible Care. efforts, the Houston Operations had a leadership role in establishing the Citizen's Advisory Council to Deer Park industry in 1990.  The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets monthly and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nThe facility has implemented a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) in which employee participation at all levels is required in designing, implementing and maintaining safety programs.  Safety is a primary concern in our facility and is demonstrated by our selection by OSHA in Sept.1997 as an OSHA Star facility under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, OxyVinyls has established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n2.

VCM Site 3 contains only one substance, vinyl chloride, which is covered by the RMP rule as the process quantity of vinyl chloride exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.   The largest vessel inventory of vinyl chloride is 9 million pounds.  Five (5) vinyl chloride storage tanks of equal size are located on this site.  Vinyl chloride from these storage tanks is pumped to an OxyVinyls PVC plant.  As the vinyl chloride storage area is inter-connected by piping, it is considered a single Vinyl Chloride Storage process.  Based on the RMP criteria for process program levels, this is considered a Program 3 process.\n\n3.   The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (' 68.155(c))\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate potential affects to the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\".  OxyVinyls does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario.  The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are based on more likely potential accidental releases.  These have been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.  \n\nDistances to flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.

This flammable substance release scenario assumes that the entire contents of the tank (9,000,000 lbs.) is released and vaporizes to form a vapor cloud that subsequently ignites.  In this scenario, an endpoint of 1-psi over normal atmospheric pressure would extend to a distance of 1.3 miles.  U.S. Census data indicates that approximately 4,700 persons live within this distance from the storage tank.  Potential public receptors include schools, residences, recreation areas, and industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance from the release point.\n\nAn alternate release scenario for vinyl chloride that was selected involves a 2-inch hole in the discharge piping on the VCM Storage Tank Pumps.  This would be expected to release approximately 13,000 lbs. of vinyl chloride before the vapor cloud ignited.  No credit is taken for active or passive mitigation in the analysis. In this scenario, an endpoint of 1-psi over normal atmospheric pressure would extend to a distance of 0.09 miles.
