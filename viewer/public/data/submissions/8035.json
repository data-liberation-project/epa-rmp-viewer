The facility is located at 6000 SE 2nd St. Overall, the facility employs 220 full-time employees.\n\n1.    The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\nUCB is committed to operating the Tecumseh Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, UCB has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Tecumseh Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Tecumseh Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the RMP at the "

      "SummaryText": "Tecumseh Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program at the plant.  The Tecumseh Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nUCB limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Tecumseh Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, UCB considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nUCB strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  UCB implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, UCB requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure for all new or modifications to existing process.  UCB's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nUCB's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release. In the event of an accidental release, the Tecumseh Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  UCB utilizes emergency response plans as required by federal "

The specific hazards of Carbon Disulfide are as follows:\n7 a flammable liquid, a toxic liquid (only on \"toxic\" list under RMP)\n7 irritating to the eyes, ears, nose, and throat\n7 a suspected reproduction hazard\n7 adversely affects the heart and central nervous system\n\n\n3.    The Worst-case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Case Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (68.155(c))\nThe Tecumseh Plant performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The off-site consequence analysis evaluates a \"worst-case release scenario \" and an \"alternative case release scenario\".

The EPA-recommended Landview III Program, available from the U.S. Census, was utilized to estimate the number of people living within worst-case and alternative case distances from the location of the storage tank and the public and environmental receptors located within these distances.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by the Tecumseh Plant:\n\n3.1.    Program 2 Process(es) - Toxic Substance(s)\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for Carbon Disulfide is based on a full release of the largest tank (10,800 gallons or 112,000 pounds).  It was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.49 miles.  The U.S. Census indicates that 44 people live within this distance from the location of the tank.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance including residences, commercial areas, and recreation areas.  No environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nAs required by the EPA, this worst-case analysis discounted the presence of all active mitigation systems, including the water mote beneath the carbon disulfide tanks.  Under an actual worst-case release, the water would float on top of the denser carbon disulfide, providing a blanket that would capture the vast majority of chemical vapors.\n\nThe \"alternative case release scenario\" for Carbon Disulfide is a liquid release of the full contents of the transfer hose during delivery.  To be conservative, it was assumed that the liquid spill would occur outside the diked area onto an impervious surface.  The total liquid spill was calculated at 43 pounds.  Vapors would be emitted from the resulting pool at a rate of 1.3 pounds per minute, for 34 minutes (until the liquid pool is evaporated).  Based on this data, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 0.03 miles.  No people, "

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(d))\nSince 1997, the Tecumseh Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1999, the plant formalized this prevention program for the cellophane manufacturing and storage process.\n\nIn 1996, the EPA RMP rule established another level of prevention requirements:\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Tecumseh Plant's Program 2 prevention program that addresses EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n4.1.    Program 2 Prevention Program\nThe Tecumseh Plant's Program 2 prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n4.1.1.    Safety Information\nThe Tecumseh Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  The plant ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees, the LEPC, the Tecumseh Fire Department, the St. Francis Hospital, and the Shawnee County Sheriff's Office.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes. The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n7 Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits \n7 Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point) \n7 Reactivity and corrosively data \n7 Thermal and chemical stability data\n7 Hazards of mixing substances in the process\n\nMSDSs for hazard"

The available information includes:\n\n7 Operating parameters\n7 Block flow or simplified process flow diagrams\n7 Process chemistry\n7 Maximum intended inventories\n7 Safe upper and lower limits for parameters such as temperature, pressure, or flow\n7 Consequences of deviations from established operating limits\n7 Design basis and configuration of equipment\n7 Piping and instrumentation diagrams, including materials of construction\n7 Electrical classification\n7 Safety systems\n7 Applicable design codes and standards\n7 Design basis for relief and ventilation systems\n\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analyses of the process.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used to (1) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, and (3) help maintain the equipment.\n\n4.1.2.    Hazard Review\nThe Tecumseh Plant performs and updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.
