All required repairs are performed at that time.  Further inspections are performed semi annually by the Missouri Department of Ag.\n\nEmergency response policies are as described below:\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThis facility is located just outside of Boonville, Missouri.  It has 2 anhydous ammonia tanks, 26,000 and 12,000 gallons capacity.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case scenario for the anhydrous ammonia operation envisions a catastrophic failure of the storage tank, possibly preceded by failure of the relief valves.  Regulatory and procedural controls limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank to 80% of capacity.  Using RMP*COMP, the toxic endpoint was calculated at 3.6 miles.  This would include virtually the entire town of Boonville.\n\nAlterrnate release scenarios could involve a hose failure allowing product to escape.  The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia would be 0.5 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with 29 CFR 1910.111 (anhydrous ammonia)\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility is located just outside of the city limits of Boonville, Mo. Employees will notify the fire department in the event of a major release.  Trained employees are authorized to take appropriate actions to stop small releases by shutting off valves, etc.  Other employees will notify the fire department and evacuate the area as necessary.  There is a written emergency respone plan in place"
