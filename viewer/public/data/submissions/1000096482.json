In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST AND ALTERNATE CASE DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Worst and Alternate Case Scenario's used in the RMP were decided to be the most likely to occur are the facility. Additional scenario's that were considered: but are not limited to; are Transfer Hose Ruptures, Passive Mitigation, Valve Failures, Pump Failures, and Mishandling or Ruptured Vessels and/or Containers.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Brewster Cheese - Stockton, IL facility is located at 300 W. Railroad Ave. in Stockton, Illinois. The facility has an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n\n\nThe system uses approximately 13,805 pounds of ammonia to provide refrigeration for cooling dairy products.  The majority of the system including vessels and compressors are located inside and outside of the facility building. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nBrewster Cheese - Stockton, IL ammonia refrigeration system has ma"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\n\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shutdown button that kills power to engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Brewster Cheese accident history showed that there had been no reportable accidents with ammonia in the last 5 years. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBrewster Cheese - Stockton, IL has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Facility Safety Manual located in the Safety Coordinator's office. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)
