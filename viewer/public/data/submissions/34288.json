      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAqua Chlor provides chlorination for recreational swimming pools in the Tracy, California area.  Aqua Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1993.\n\nAqua Chlor's general manager and owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The general manager administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, hazardous materials business plans, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1993.  The process is located at15885 Altamont Pass Road, Tracy, California, 95391.  The chlorine transfer process for Aqua Chlor consists of chlorine one-ton containers (maximum of 8 one ton cylinders and 90 full 20 lb. cylinders).  The one-ton cylinders are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from a one ton container through a filling manifold to 20 pound cylinders.  The system also includes a scrubber water tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 17,800 pounds.  The filling station is located outside. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAqua Chlor has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutralize displaced chl"

Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAqua Chlor has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (May 2003) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (June 2004).  All recommendations from the audit will be addressed by August 2004.  All recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation have an estimated completion date of December 2004. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
