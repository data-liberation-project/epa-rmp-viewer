We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and emergency response planning to help ensure the safety and health of our employees, the public, and the environment.  This Executive Summary provides an overview of the comprehensive risk management and process safety procedures and practices that we have designed and implemented at the Indian Orchard Plant and includes information on the following:\n\n-  A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.\n-  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n-  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP rule.\n-  An overview of our emergency response programs\n-  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the surrounding community, or the environment.\n\n\nFACILITY (STATIONARY SOURCE) DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Indian Orchard Plant was originally established by the Fiberloid Corporation in 1904 and purchased by Monsanto Company in 1938.  In 1963, Monsanto acquired the Shawinigan Resins facility on the opposite side of Grochmal Avenue, creating the current site.  The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982 and following a spin-off from Monsanto in 1997, Solutia Inc. was formed.  The site includes manufacturing units producing high-value specialty products that include Saflex interlayer, Gelva adhesives, Butvar resin, and Resimene coatings.  The site also includes a Technical Center, complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities, finished product"

In addition, IneosNOVA and MassPower own and operate facilities within the borders of the Indian Orchard site.  Under current site operations, the Resimenes Department, and all associated assets, is owned by Ineos Melamines and the Adhesives Department, and all associated assets, is owned by Cytec Industries, Inc.  However, the processes in both of these departments continue to be operated and maintained by Solutia employees, they are included in SolutiaA?s process safety management programs, and they have been reported in this Risk Management Plan.  The entire plant occupies approximately 250 acres and Solutia currently employs approximately 460 people from the greater Springfield area and surrounding communities.  Additional employees for IneosNOVA, MassPower, Ineos Melamines, and Cytec Industries also work at the site.  \n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nIn our current production processes, we use two chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM)\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped by our suppliers as a liquid in approved railcars.  An average of 3 railcars are typically present at the site at any given time, however, a maximum of 5 railcars may be stored at the site to support plant operations.  These railcars are unloaded into an aboveground storage tank that has a capacity of approximately 200,000 gallons and is filled to 80% capacity or 160,000 gallons.  This tank is located inside a concrete containment structure designed to hold the entire contents of the tank in the event of an accidental release.  The facilityA?s Adhesives Department uses vinyl acetate in the production of numerous gelva adhesive products for various applications while our South Butvar Department utilizes vinyl acetate as a key raw"

Significantly smaller A?Day TanksA? of approximately 5,000 gallons capacity are utilized in each department to support daily production needs.\n\nFormaldehyde\n\nFormaldehyde in an aqueous (water-based) solution, also called A?FormalinA?, is shipped to the site by our suppliers in approved tank trucks that are unloaded upon arrival into one of two bulk storage tanks.  One tank has a capacity of 83,000 gallons and can be filled to a maximum volume of 80,000 gallons while the other has a capacity of 35,000 gallons and a maximum fill volume of approximately 33,000 gallons.  Under current plant operations, the smaller tank is not being used.  An additional A?Day TankA? of approximately 7,000 gallons capacity is utilized in the process area to support daily production needs.  The inventory of Formalin is used exclusively by the Resimenes Department of the Indian Orchard Plant in the production of metal coatings used in automotive paints and other industrial applications. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic and proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals at our facility.

His primary responsibilities include implementation of SolutiaA?s corporate process safety and risk management requirements and initiatives as well as enhancement of the existing programs at the site.  Our Process Safety Lead functions as the Indian Orchard Plant representative on SolutiaA?s company-wide Process Safety Core Team, Facility Siting Task Force, and Management of Change Team.  A great deal of progress has been made in the continuous improvement of the process safety and risk management systems at the Indian Orchard Plant, and within Solutia as a whole, during the last two years.  Some examples of these improvements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFacility Siting:  SolutiaA?s Facility Siting Task Force developed and issued the final version of the Solutia Corporate Facility Siting Procedure in 2008.  This document specifies the requirements for evaluating and controlling the potential risks to personnel in permanent, portable, and temporary buildings at all Solutia-owned sites worldwide.  During the course of 2008 and 2009 thus far, several tasks related to facility siting were conducted by the Indian Orchard Plant including: building occupancy surveys; portable and temporary building inventories; development of dust explosion and toxic release scenarios; and initial facility siting evaluations of all Solutia operations at the facility.\n\nCompliance Auditing:  SolutiaA?s Process Safety Core Team made several improvements to the companyA?s compliance auditing program for process safety and risk management over the last year including a complete revision of the audit methodology, staffing requirements, and checklists to be used by all U.S. sites when conducting process safety management and/or risk manag"

The team also established company-wide requirements for the timing and approval of resolutions to recommendations generated during PHAs and LOPAs.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):  Members of SolutiaA?s PSCT, including our Process Safety Lead, volunteered to create an MOC Sub-Team to evaluate MOC practices and develop a set of minimum standards to provide a thorough and consistent approach for managing changes of all types within Solutia.  The team developed a common workflow and flowchart, drafted a specification for the evaluation and purchase of MOC software, evaluated 7 different electronic MOC packages through online demonstrations and webinars, and prepared and presented a recommendation for purchase to Solutia senior management.  \n\nContractor Safety:  Solutia and the Indian Orchard Plant began the implementation of a new contractor qualification program for all U.S. sites that utilizes a third party administrator, called BROWZ, to conduct thorough and consistent evaluation of contractors in accordance with SolutiaA?s requirements.  Training was provided to all of the siteA?s Contractor Management Representatives in 2008 and additional training is being conducted during 2009.\n\nSafety Instrumented Systems:  The programs and practices for Safety Instrumented Systems, known as A?Instrumented Protective SystemsA? (IPSs) at the Indian Orchard Plant, continue to evolve and improve.  In 2008, the plantA?s E&I Technical Specialist was designated as the IPS issue owner for the site.

Our IPS issue owner is also a member of SolutiaA?s IPS Network, tasked with the development of company-wide standards and work practices related to instrumented systems and alarms.\n\nAs part of the IPS program, four different computer-based training (CBT) programs were deployed for site employees in 2008.  The content of each CBT was tailored to address the needs of a specific group of employees and their responsibilities related to IPS.  Each employeeA?s training requirements are based on job function, with more in-depth training required for those employees who are directly involved with production processes, such as operators, supervisors, electricians, and mechanics.  The four training programs developed include:  Instrumented Protective Systems Overview, Management Responsibilities for IPS, Operations Responsibilities, and Maintenance Responsibilities.  In addition, the siteA?s Process Safety Lead completed training on SolutiaA?s method for conducting Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to facilitate the evaluation and classification of any new instrumented protective systems proposed for the plant operations.\n\n"
