Bayway Chemical Plant\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Infineum USA L.P.Bayway Chemical Plant has had a long-\r\nstanding commitment to protecting their employees, the public,\r\nand the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the\r\nresources invested in accident prevention such as: providing\r\ncomprehensive initial and refresher personnel training,\r\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation,\r\ninspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting\r\ndrills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to\r\nimplement controls to minimize the potential for releases.\r\nHowever, if a release occurs, our trained personnel will respond\r\nto control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\r\n\r\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system\r\nentitled OIMPS, Operations Integrity Management PracticeS, and a\r\nTotal Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the\r\nprevention of incidents. Our Operations Integrity Management\r\nSystems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our\r\nsafety-related systems.  These systems are evergreen and are in a\r\ncontinuous state of improvement, usually through many small\r\nimprovement steps.  Some examples are the recommendations from\r\nour hazard reviews and any incident investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Bayway Chemical Plant has been recognized by the Occupational\r\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a VPP STAR Facility\r\n(Voluntary Protection Program - Safety Through Accountability and\r\nRecognition) for its effective safety and health management\r\nprograms.
