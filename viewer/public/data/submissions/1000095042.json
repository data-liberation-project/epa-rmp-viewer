This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.

Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Layton Bakery processing operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Layton Bakery is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nLayton Bakery has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Layton Bakery has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \r\n\r\n- Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Layton Bakery has had no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years. \r\n \r\nEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nLayton Bakery current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance from local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, fir"

The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nLayton Bakery currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Layton Bakery personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
