The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\nOn August 21, 2013, an equipment failure at the Sterlington Terminal resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Based on engineering estimates, approximately 365 pounds of ammonia were released.  There were no onsite or offsite deaths, injuries or property damage.  However, traffic on Solvent Avenue, south of the Terminal, was briefly diverted as a precautionary measure.  The cause of the release was an unpredictable mechanical failure of a pump seal.
