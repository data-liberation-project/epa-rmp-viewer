If an emergency were to occur, it is KF's policy to notify the Louisiana State Police and Ouachita Parish Emergency Operations Center.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Koch Fertilizer, LLC - Sterlington  Ammonia Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in and distributes it from two refrigerated cylinder tanks (20,000,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per tank), three bullet tanks (one 200-ton bullet tank (400,000 pounds), and two 20 ton bullet tanks (40,000 pounds per tank)).  The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 40,480,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The facility complies with EPA's chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\nOn August 21, 2013, an equipment failure at the Sterlington Terminal resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  Based on engineering estimates, approximately 365 pounds of ammonia were released.  There were no onsite or offsite deaths, injuries or property damage.  However, traffic on Solvent Avenue, south of the Terminal, was briefly diverted as a precautionary measure.  The cause of the release was an unpredictable mechanical failure of a pump seal.  The seal has since be"
