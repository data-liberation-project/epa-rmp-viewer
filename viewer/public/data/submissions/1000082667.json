In addition, we are committed to continuous improvement through the chemical industry's Responsible Distribution Program (RD) through the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  \r\n\r\nAs part of our Quality Assurance, CFATs and RD commitments, we make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new operations, products, processes and facilities.  \r\n\r\nWe have had ZERO reportable releases in the previous 5 years.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances.  \r\n\r\nSAL Chemical's operations include warehousing, repackaging, and distribution of municipal and industrial type chemicals.  SAL Chemical maintains an inventory of chlorine that exceeds the EPA's threshold.  \r\n\r\nSAL may have up to 51,000# of chlorine stored outdoors in both 2000# and 150# cylinders.  Maximum inventory of 70% HF will 5,000#. These products are NOT repackaged; they are stored, inventoried, and shipped to the customer in the original containers.  \r\n\r\nThe chlorine storage and distribution operation is regulated by OSHA's PSM rule and therefore is a Program 3 process.  The worst case release of chlorine at the facility would be a catastrophic release of 2000# of chlorine from a one ton container over a 10 minute period.  The extent of the release was calculated without taking credit for any mitigating factors, which are in accordance with EPA requirements for calculation the effects of a worst case release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/L is 1.3 miles, which would potentially impact a residential population of 2700.  EPA's model RMPComp was used in estimating the distance to the toxic endpoint.

It is estimated that the leak could continue for 60 minutes before being stopped.  Although unlikely to occur, this release scenario is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario described above.  This release would be mitigated by Sal Chemical's storage and inspection programs.  The containers are stored away from vehicular traffic, and the containers are inspected daily.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is .1 mile, which would not reach a public receptor.  The release rate was derived from EPA's RMP guidance for wastewater treatment plants, and the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated using RMP Comp.  The residential population was estimated from the US census bureau's internet site.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHF storage is a program 1.  A worst case release of HF would be 350# released inside a 10,000 Foot building.  The release rate to the outside air is .21 pounds per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of .016mg/L for this release is .1 mile, which would not reach a public receptor.
