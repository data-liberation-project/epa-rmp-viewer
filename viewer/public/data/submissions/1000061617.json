MVSD furnishes potable water to the Cities of Youngstown and Niles, and it acts as an agent for these cities in supplying the Village of McDonald. These cities then supply water to the surrounding metropolitan areas including Girard, Canfield, Mineral Ridge, and portions of eight townships. MVSD presently serves 220,000 people and produces an average flow of 22 million gallons per day.\n\n\n\nChlorine is the chemicals used in the treatment process to produce water that is safe to drink. Chlorine is listed under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)Title 40 Subpart F, (68.115 Threshold Determination) and (68.130 List of Substances) as a requlated toxic substance and the threshold quantities for accidental release prevention are 2,500 lbs. Since the quantity of Chlorine (48,000 lbs.) stored at the WTP is greater than the threshold values, MVSD must comply with CFR Title 40 Part 68 which requires the development and implementation of a risk management program.\n\n\n\nChlorine is toxic when inhaled or ingested. MVSD is aware of the dire consequences that exposure to this chemical, even in the smallest amount, can have on the environment, the public, and our employees. MVSD is committed to handling Chlorine, and all other chemicals in the safest manner possible. The philosophy and objuctives behind this commitment are:\n\n\n\n1. The safety and health of all District employees is a prime priority.\n\n\n\n2. The only acceptable level of safety and health performance is one that prevents injury and accidents.\n\n\n\n3. Safety and health are an integral part of the daily business functions.\n\n\n\n4. Safety and health are a responsibility that must be shared equally and without exception by everyone in the organization, and;\n\n\n\n5. Management and those with supervisory responsibilities will be held accountable for the safety and health of the personn"

All employees will be required to make their safety and the safety of their fellow workers a prime priority.\n\n\n\nMVSD is committed to the safe storage, use, and handling of Chlorine, especially during the transfer of this chemical, to minimize the potential for accidental release to the environment.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program consists of MVSD's and its employees commitment to the safe handling, storage and use of Chlorine.\n\n\n\nMVSD's WTP is included in Trumbull County's Emergency Response Plan and MVSD's Emergency action Plan contains the appropriate mechanism to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. Additional information of importance of dealing with emergency response can be found in the Vulnerability Assessment Plan.\n\n\n\nThe District is pursuing several capital improvement projects which will increase security and may result in the removal of chlorine as a chemical stored at the Water Plant.\n\n\n\nThere were no accidents in the past five (5) years, and no changes to the safety program are planned.\n\n"
