The company stores and\ndistributes anhydrous ammonia in pressure vessels.\nCHS believes that the health, safety, and the preservation of our environment are critical components of\neffective management and business success. As a company, we are committed to:\n??A? Providing a secure and health conscious work environment for employees and visitors\n??A? Conducting our business with always having value for the communities in which -we operate and in the\nspirit of a good neighbor\n??A? Meeting or exceeding the requirements of the environmental, health, & safety laws and regulations\n??A? Training employees on the environmental, health & safety requirements of their jobs\n??A? Working with government and other stakeholders to identify and solve problems\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in pressure vessels on properties. It is transferred into the vessel from either\nsemi-transports or rail cars and then placed into application equipment or nurse tanks. The application\nequipment and/or nurse tanks are then transported to the farmer's field where the anhydrous ammonia is\ninjected into the soil.\nAn anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety release valves that are designed to release\npressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized. The tanks are also equipped with excessive flow\nvalves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should happen.\nThe worst-case release scenario is created to show how far a plume of ammonia with a concentration greater\nthan 200 parts per million (PPM) would travel before being dispersed to a safe exposure level.\nA complete discharge of the storage vessel would be a very unusual event. We are also required to create an\nalternative or more likely release event. Although we will continue to do what we can to ensure no\naccidental release occurs, we have chosen a 2-inch pipe or hose rupture to meet"

      "SummaryText": " this requirement. Again,\ncalculations show the extent of the plume with an ammonia concentration greater than 200 PPM.\nWe have used RMP Comp to calculate the area these types of releases would impact. RMP Comp is supplied\nto us by the EPA. It tends to over exaggerate the plume, which in turn adds a good safety factor into the\nplanning process. Our written programs are continually updated and are available for review at the ammonia\nstorage locations.\nIn the event of a release from a storage facility that could impact the community, we advise those in the\naffected area to shelter in place until the plume dissipates. Shelter in place involves everyone in the affected\narea seeking shelter indoors, shutting the windows and turning off the air conditioning and other ventilation\nsystems.\nCHS operates over 100 storage sites across the country. In the past five years we have had very few releases\nfrom fixed storage facilities. No one was injured or evacuated due to those releases. Vandalism and theft\nfrom nurse tanks has accounted for the majority of our releases.\nOur employees are trained in the characteristics and proper handling procedures for anhydrous ammonia.\nThey are equipped with the proper personal protective equipment for routine handling of the product. The\ntraining also covers the basics in responding to emergencies involving ammonia releases and is available to\nassist the community first responders with technical information and advice.\nCHS provide training, training material and emergency response information to each fire department with\njurisdiction over our fire department. We also meet with concerned citizen and other interested parties\nabout our risk management program and anhydrous ammonia safety in general.\nCHS continually updates the training provided to its employees. Employees are trained in proper handling,\nfacility inspections, ammonia characteristics; emergency procedures and must review the emergency\nresponse plan, emergency action plan, and site "
