The facility takes gaseous hydrogen from the Linde Gulf Coast pipeline, which we then purify and liquefy. The final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product is stored in an insulated storage tank and is shipped by truck throughout the US. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances \n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\nLiquid and gaseous Hydrogen - Manufactured on-site and shipped to customer by truck.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\n \n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy calls for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and communities where we operate. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs. \n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and endorses ACC's program of Responsible Care; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n \n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the La Porte, TX Hydrogen Production facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n\n\n-    Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parame"

Following is a description of some of these safety features. \n\n\n\nHydrogen liquid storage and Hydrogen gaseous operations\n\n \n\nStorage area is monitored by plant personnel; Operators monitor storage area via remote video monitoring equipment. System has automatic shutdown of fill valves. We also have lower explosive limit atmospheric monitoring and deluge systems.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Linde La Porte, TX hydrogen production process is a new process.  The La Porte facility currently has three on-site Bulk Air Gases Production facilities and the accident history indicates continuous safe operation of these non-covered chemical processes over the last five years. There have been no non-covered process releases that resulted in a recordable accident. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n \n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the publi"
