Our safety, health, and environmental policy calls for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and communities where we operate. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs. \n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and endorses ACC's program of Responsible Care; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n \n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the La Porte, TX Hydrogen Production facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n\n\n-    Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to control these substances, and the critical operating parame"
