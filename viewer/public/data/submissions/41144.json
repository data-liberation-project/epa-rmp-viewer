      "SummaryText": "Superior operates a chemical distribution facility located at 400 West Regent Street, Indianapolis, Indiana.  The primary operations consist of unloading, storage, repackaging, custom blending, and distribution of chemicals to retail and wholesale customers.  A wide range and variety of solvents and industrial chemicals are handled at the facility.\n\nCurrently, Superior has the potential to store methyl formate (CAS 107-31-3) at levels in excess of EPA?s threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum anticipated amount of this material in storage is 60,000 pounds.\n\nThe Indianapolis facility is identified as a stationary source, based on the criteria that Superior owns the property, the processes are contained within the property boundary, and no other companies operate on the property.  Therefore Superior is required to comply and file a RMP for all covered processes within the facility boundary that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The substance listed above is not subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s accidental release prevention rule (40 CFR ?68) and with other applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with various NFPA standards, the most relevant is NFPA 30, the Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code.\n\nTraining is conducted as part of various regulatory and voluntary programs, such as ISO 14001 and the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) programs.  This training consists of classroom and on-the-job training.  \n\nThere have been no accidents or releases involving methyl formate at the facility to date.\n\nSuperior has an Emergency Action program and does not respond to major releases.  However, the Emergency Action Plan has been sent to local agencies in order to coordinate any necessary response actions.\n\nThe off-site consequnce analysis indicates that the worst case scenario - a vapor cloud explosion for the v"
