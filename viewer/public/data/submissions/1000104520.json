The following is a list of improvements that are being evaluated or implemented at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n- Continue to perform root cause analyses on mechanical reliability issues.\n- Continue to improve centralized corporate initiatives for application of training across North\nAmerica.\n- Identification and implementation of process safety best practices from Celanese sites to the\ncorporation through common work practices and an integrated management system."

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. We are a m"

The release duration is 10 min, as required by 40CFR68.25(c)(2).   RMP*Comp\u2122 an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances of 23 miles to reach the 0.09 mg/l (ERPG-2) endpoint.  Meteorological conditions for worst-case scenarios are defined in 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour).  No other toxic scenario from a covered process resulted in a greater distance to an endpoint nor covered different public receptors from the selected scenario.\n\nOne Alternative Case Scenario was included for each of the toxic substances held on site.  Meteorological conditions for these alternative case scenarios were atmospheric stability class D (stable atmosphere), wind speed of  3 meters per second (6.7 miles per hour) and 77F. \n-\tA release of EO from a 2\u201d hole on the Ethox loop pipe that resulted in gas release.
