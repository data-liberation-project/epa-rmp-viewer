Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring proper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\n?    Assist Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont and local government agencies in their communication and coordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThis document addresses Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont's administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks.  The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia.

Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the Plant Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont facility is located at 43960 Fremont Blvd., in Fremont, California, at the intersection of Auto Mall Parkway and Fremont Boulevard, approximately 0.6 miles west of Freeway 680 and 1.0 mile east of Freeway 880. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.   \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Arctic Glacier USA - Fremont is the production and storage of ice. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and storage of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 140 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).

Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n?    Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n?    A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n?    A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n?    A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n?
