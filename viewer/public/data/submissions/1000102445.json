This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been assembled in order to satisfy the requirements set forth within Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Slack Chemical's stationary source subject to this RMP is located at 21 Grande Blvd, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 and the regulated substance present in more than a threshold quantity is Chlorine as a liquefied gas stored in 150 pound cylinders and 2,000 pound containers.\n\nThe worse-case release scenario is a total release of regulated substance from the largest storage container on-site, that being a 2,000 lb (ton) container. A puncture or breakage of a 150 lb cylinder has been considered as the alternative release scenario. For both scenarios, only passive mitigation measures apply, as the regulated substance is stored inside the facility.\n\nThe regulated substance, mentioned above, subject to this RMP is covered by Prevention Program 3. The elements within Program 3 have been satisfied and implemented as described further in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe Saratoga Springs facility has been handling and storing chlorine cylinders and ton containers for nearly 20 years and has, to date, not had any incident involving the release of regulated substances from a covered process nor have any possible incidents occurred that may have resulted in a release of regulated substances.\n\nProcedures concerning an emergency response plan or action plan have been created and applied in accordance with OSHA standards. The plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of all chemicals stored on-site.  Slack Chemical Company employees will work hand in hand with emergency first responders as advisors and technical support in the event"
