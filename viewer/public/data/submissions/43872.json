      "SummaryText": "The City of Lawton owns and operates a Wastewater Treatment Plant that uses/stores chlorine (CL2) gas as a disinfectant in its plant discharge before it is discharged into Nine Mile Creek.  The concentrated form of this disinfection agent, before it is mixed with water, can be extremely hazardous if a sudden release/ spill of a 1-ton container occur.  Chlorine gas is stored both inside and outside of the Chlorine Building #43 out of direct sunlight with overhead protection.  The WWTP also uses Sulfur Dioxide for removal of chlorine from the effluent prior to discharge into Nine Mile Creek.  The Sulfur Dioxide is stored both inside and outside of building #47.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes the chemical hazards of chlorine (CL2) and sulfur dioxide gas and explains what the Lawton WWTP is doing to prevent an accidental release/ spill.  This plan has been developed and implemented in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Provisions regulations (40 CFR 68) and guidelines.  \n\nThe following regulated substance at the Lawton Wastewater Treatment Plant is stored in quantities above the applicable EPA RMP threshold quantity:\n\nSOURCE NAME CHEMICAL City of Lawton WWTP BUILDING 43\nCHEMICAL NAME: CHLORINE\nCAS NUMBER:  7782-50-5\nMAXIMUM NVENTORY QUANTITY (IN POUNDS):  28,000\n\nSOURCE NAME CHEMICAL City of Lawton WWTP BUILDING 47\nCHEMICAL NAME: SULFUR DIOXIDE\nCAS NUMBER:  7446-06-5\nMAXIMUM NVENTORY QUANTITY (IN POUNDS):  24,000\n\nThe Lawton WWTP currently has two stationary sources subject to EPA RMP regulations.  The WWTP chlorine feeder room consists of chlorinators that inject chlorine (CL2) gas into its final discharge, for disinfection, before it is discharged into Nine Mile Creek.  The chlorine feeder room is equipped with a ventilation system that, under normal operations, is on standby.  A chlorine detector monitors the air within the room for chlorine gas.

The feeder room as well as 1-ton container storage/ usage room is heated for temperature control.  The feeders and containers are housed under one roof, with concrete block walls to protect from the sun and elements.  The 1-ton containers are placed on wooden chocks mounted to the concrete floor this prevents rolling of containers.  The Chlorine 1-ton Container Storage/ usage Building, (building #43) is used to store up to (12) twelve 1-ton containers, normally (10) ten are kept on hand with  at least one (1) being hooked-up all the time.  Two (2) are in use, two (2) are in standby/ ready to use as other two (2) empty. These 1-ton containers may be all full at any given time.  The containers are hooked-up to a manifold toward the north end of building #43, in the middle of the building.  The chlorinators/ feeders are located in the East side room of building #43, with entrance from the East side door.  The 1-ton containers on the inside of buildings #43 and #47 are maintained at a constant temperature between 60 and 80 degrees F by a ventilation/heating system.\n\nThe temperature of the chlorination/dechlorination system area (feeders, containers that are hooked up and in use or in standby mode) should never reach the critical temperature for CL2 or SO2 gas (290 degrees F).  However, at these temperatures chlorine and or sulfur dioxide will only exist in a gaseous phase.\n \nBecause the WWTP does not meet the criteria for the Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) it becomes mandatory to manage the process under Program 2 requirements of the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nLawton is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.

The ERP outlines activities and programs which eliminate and/or reduce the likelihood of a disaster, programs developed to save lives and minimize damage, actions taken to provide emergency assistance, and the activities which return the facility to normal or improved standards.  Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.  \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO    \n\nDispersion modeling was performed to estimate areas that could be affected by a worst-case chlorine and sulfur dioxide release scenario under the least favorable weather conditions.  Prevention and control measures were no considered in evaluating the worst-case scenario.\nAccording to the RMP guidelines, a worst case scenario would involve a rupture of a full 1-Ton container of Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide with a release time of approximately 10 minutes.  The entire content of the container would be released with a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  As a result of the pressure of the released gas, the building would fail and all 2000 lbs of the gas are released into the environment.  Using data prod\\vided above, the air dispersion modeling software calculated a total plume distance for the worst-case scenario of 3.0 miles for Chlorine and of 3.1 miles for Sulfur Dioxide.  The worst-case scenario represents the maximum conceivable impact for a release.  Release reporting databases and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario is so unlikely that it should not be the basis for emergency planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nDispersion modeling was also performed to estimate the effective areas for at least one alternative release scenarios for each regulated substance in a regulated process.  The alternative release scenario is based on a split or the decoupling of a 0.375-inch"

If the building is assumed to fail (as a result of buildup of internal pressure), the distance to the toxic endpoint (plume distance) was estimated to be approximately 0.10 miles (176 yards) downwind of the WWTP.\n\nThe most effective reduction in any risk to the community is achieved by focusing emergency planning on responding to the alternative release scenarios. \n\nTRAINING\n\nWell-trained operators/maintenance operators are integral to prevention and mitigation of the effects of accidental releases/spills of hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe City of Lawton, Assistant Director of Public Works and the RMP team are responsible for maintaining the written Employee Training Program and associated training material and training records.  The WWTP Superintendent is responsible for ensuring that all personnel involved in the handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide at the WWTP complete and maintain all training requirements for his or her position, and that all supporting documentation is filed.  The WWTP Superintendent plans classroom training for all personnel and periodically reviews training records to insure that all employees receive the required training.  \n\nThe City of Lawton WTP encourages employee participation and input in maintaining a safe work environment though an Employee Participation Plan.  All new employees will be trained in Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide handling safety, alone with any updates to (SOPs) Standard Operating Procedures.  The City of Lawton WWTP Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Manuals and RMP will be used as the primary guidance during training.
