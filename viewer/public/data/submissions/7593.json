Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\n4/9/99      Contaminated sodium chlorate resulted in a decomposition in the generator and an estimated 0.1 pound of chlorine dioxide being released.\n\n3/23/99    The pipe suppling scrubbing medium to the bleach plant scrubber plugged.  The residual chlorine dioxide from the bleaching process was not being scrubbed out.  This resulted in a release of an estimated 8.9 pounds.\n\n9/7/98      The packing in a manual valve in the No. 2 Bleach plant failed allowing a ver"

We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces bleached pulp, fine papers and unbleached corrugating medium using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The bleached pulp uses a kraft pulping process and supplies fiber to the fine paper manufacturing facility.  The corrugating medium uses a combination of semichemical and recycled pulp.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nA 1% solution of chlorine dioxide is stored in 140,000 gallon tanks and is used to bleach hardwood kraft pulp.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is stored in 1000 gallon tanks and is used to fuel the material handling equipment on site.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThis scenario assumes the rupture of a full, 140,000 gallon tank containing a 1% chlorine dioxide solution and the vaporization of the released solution.  The tank has dikes present to mitigate the extent of the release.  The model suggests the off site consequences would be in the area defined by a circle with the radius of 4.78 miles form the source (mill).  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThis scenario assumes a 1% chlorine dioxide solution process pipe leak.  This leak results in the release of the contents of an eight (8) inch pipe, 250 feet in length. This scenario assumes no mitigation, and a release of 55 pounds of chlorine dioxide that is vapoized from the liquid release.  This model suggests the area impacted by the off site consequences would be defined by a circle with the diameter of 1.3 miles from the release site (mill).\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis scenario assumes that a 1000 gallon propane storage tank has a leak that results in a vapor cloud explosion. It also assumes no mitigation is present.  The model suggests there would be no off site consequences since the model endpoint would be 663 feet (0.12 miles) from the source and the nearest off site receptor in 1850 feet away (0.35 miles)\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis scenario assumes a pool fire resulting from a pipe failure/tank contents release of a 1000 gallon propane storage tank.  The model suggests the effects would be"
