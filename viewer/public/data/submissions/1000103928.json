This review ensures all requirements are met before the introduction of any highly hazardous chemical into a new or modified process.  This review is done before startup to verify that safety issues have been addressed. This final pre-startup review aids in ensuring that changes in the system are properly installed and tested before startup.  \n\n\n1.4.8    Compliance Audits\n\nAt least every three years, Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC Fernandina Plant evaluates the effectiveness of the PSM/RMP system.
