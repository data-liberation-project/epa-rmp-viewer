In service to the community, the City  has a history of adhering to proactive\r\napproaches for the prevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances. \r\nCurrent prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection\r\nAgency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the\r\n40 CFR 68 regulations. \r\n \r\nThe Facility is located in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida  and utilizes chlorine gas in the\r\nwastewater treatment process.  The Facility maintains a semi-enclosed (three walls and a roof,\r\nexcept that the side walls are constructed with vented block), chlorination area and chlorination\r\ndistribution system on-site. For modeling purposes, the chlorine facility is assumed to be not\r\nenclosed due to the aforementioned construction.  Chlorine is delivered to the central area and\r\nstored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine under pressure when full.\r\nThe chlorine facility holds a maximum of four (4) 2,000 pound cylinders.  \r\n\r\nThe Facility  has an outstanding performance history in conjunction with the handling, storing,\r\nmaintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since the system\r\nwent into service in  1985.  The wastewater treatment  plant is manned 16 hours/day, seven (7)\r\nday/week, 365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe handling,\r\nmaintenance and operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The\r\nchlorination system is designed utilizing latest technologies and industry specific design"

The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the\r\ncommunity emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee\r\n(LEPC).  Operational staff are trained according to these response plans. \r\n \r\nThe EPA 40 CFR 68 requires offsite consequence analysis of two (2) release scenarios for toxic\r\nsubstances identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The \"worst case release\" is\r\ndefined by EPA as \"the owner/operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest\r\nvessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For the worst case release, EPA specifies the\r\nparameters to use in calculating the distance the chlorine will travel to achieve its  \"toxic endpoint.\" \r\nThe alternative release is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\", such\r\nas a pipe leak.  \r\n\r\nUtilizing the EPA's RMP* COMP Model, a  distance of 4.3 miles was calculated for the worst case\r\nrelease toxic endpoint and 0.30 miles for the alternative release.  As per EPA regulations, the\r\npopulation is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic\r\nendpoints.  These population values are 51,323 for the worst case and  936 for the alternative\r\nrelease.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario,\r\nthe population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of\r\nan elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point\r\nsource. \r\n\r\nThe use of chlorination within water treatment and wastewater treatment has yielded enormous\r\nbenefits in this County related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.  The City, like\r\nvirtually every modern treatment facility, understands the value and risks of this treatment\r\nprocedure.  The City has an exceptional track record of no accidental releases in its history and\r\nremains ever"
