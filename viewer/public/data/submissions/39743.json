This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond and have the ability to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center, located in Borger, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce motor fuels, heating oils and solvents. The NAICS Code is 32411.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Borger Refinery and NGL Center.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as members of audit teams, to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Borger Refinery and NGL Center Employee Safety Process Man"

Health, Safety, and Environment Management System Standard.  In addition, Borger Refinery and NGL Center has a number of initiatives that address process failures, process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams including: HAZOPS, Root Cause Failure Analysis, Total Involvement Committee and PSM committee.  In addition, a hazard reporting system has been developed and administered by hourly personnel to identify, report and track employee reports of specific safety hazards.\n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). The OSHA VPP Steering committee is a group of hourly and management personnel working to maintain VPP STAR status.  Borger Refinery and NGL Center achieved OSHA VPP STAR status in October 2002.  People Observing Work Eliminating Risks (POWER), is an employee driven process designed to eliminate behaviors, which will result in employee injuries.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining current PSI documentation.  PSI reference documents are readily available as part of the written employee participation.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response medical treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS?s).

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard and risk evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least most every 5 years until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  All documentation is made available to all plant personnel.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nBorger Refinery and NGL Center maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revisiting them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Unit emergency drills are conducted regularly to evaluate emergency procedures.\n\nIn addition, the Borger Refinery and NGL Center maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.

A culture that drives towards zero accidents and incidents is the focus of ConocoPhillips? Health, Safety, and Environment Management System Standard.  In addition, Borger Refinery and NGL Center has a number of initiatives that address process failures, process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams including: HAZOPS, Root Cause Failure Analysis, Total Involvement Committee and PSM committee.  In addition, a hazard reporting system has been developed and administered by hourly personnel to identify, report and track employee reports of specific safety hazards.\n\n\n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the employee behavioral safety process and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). The OSHA VPP Steering committee is a group of hourly and management personnel working to maintain VPP STAR status.  Borger Refinery and NGL Center achieved OSHA VPP STAR status in October 2002.

For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit specific PSI document.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Borger Refinery and NGL Center has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Borger Refinery and NGL Center evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance, through audits and regular work site visits, to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSR'S)\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe Borger Refinery and NGL Center has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
