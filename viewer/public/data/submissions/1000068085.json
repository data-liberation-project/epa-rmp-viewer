Franklin Water Treatment Plant (Franklin WTP) in Charlotte, North Carolina.  This program continues The City of Charlotte's commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.  To date, so such release has occurred at the plant. The Franklin WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, The City of Charlotte has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\n\n1) Protection of public health and our employees is The City of Charlotte's highest priority.\n\n2) Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n\n3) Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent releases, including management commitment to:\n\n    a) Make all important information readily available.\n\n    b) Routinely define training to employees\n\n    c) Clearly define roles and responsibilities.\n\n4) Fulfilling his or her role in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, The City of Charlotte has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n1) The City of Charlotte's plant maintenance or operation staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\n\n2) The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures.\n\n3) The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Hot Work Permits.\n\n4) The City of Charlotte maintains a routi"

      "SummaryText": "ne Inspection and Compliance Audit schedule.\n\n5) The City of Charlotte is in the process of developing a program that requires all Contractors to pre-qualify for any work conducted for The City of Charlotte.  The Pre-Qualification process  identifies contractors that can perform site activities without compromising the safety or health of The City of Charlotte's personnel.\n\n6) Frequent employee training on the operation and maintenance of all the chlorine facilities.\n\n7) Detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all chlorine operations and maintenance have been developed and shall be adhered to.\n\n8) Pipelines that contain chlorine or chlorine solution shall bear a yellow \"chlorine\" label.\n\n9) All work on chlorine-labeled or chlorine-containing equipment must follow the SOPs and will proceed only after notification of the Plant Supervisor.\n\n10) Only those persons trained in chlorine safety shall be present during any work that could produce a release.\n\n\n\nThe City of Charlotte's emergency response program uses an external emergency response team and focuses on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the mechanical equipment and contract emergency services control the chemical release. When an employee observes a release he/she shall secure the area, if possible, immediately notify the inside plant operator, make sure the inside operator notifies one of the emergency coordinators, and leave the area.\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety, however our program is under constant review for ways to improve safety and if any planned changes come out of said reviews it will be added to the RMP executive summary or they would be noted in the MOC (Management of Change) records.\n\nWithin the last five years we have had one incident with the chlorine system.  It involved less than a pound of chlorine and was contained on site. Our commitment is to continue to review ways to improve safety and update the plan whenever necessary."
