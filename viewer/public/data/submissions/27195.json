The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Methyl chloride.  In this scenario 61500 lb. of Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to ___% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.82 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] involves a release from Vinyl Acetate.  The scenario involves the release of 1886 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of _________________.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.22 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) involves a release from Hydrochloric Acid (37%).  The scenario involves the release of 437 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

These active mitigation systems have the effect of _________________.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.82 mg/L of Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is 0.14 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Isobutylene.  In this scenario 35000 lb. of 2-Methylpropene  [1-Propene, 2-methyl-] is released.  The release quantity has been limited to ___% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.26 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Methyl vinyl ether.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 22505 lb. of Flam. Mix.: Vinyl methyl ether  [Ethene, methoxy-] in  minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is <0.06 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Isobutylene.
