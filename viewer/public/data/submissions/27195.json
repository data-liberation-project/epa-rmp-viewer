In this scenario 61500 lb. of Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to ___% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.82 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] involves a release from Vinyl Acetate.  The scenario involves the release of 1886 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of _________________.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.26 mg/L of Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 0.22 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrochloric Acid (conc 37% or greater) involves a release from Hydrochloric Acid (37%).
