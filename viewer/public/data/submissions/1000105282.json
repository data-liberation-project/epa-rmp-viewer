As of this date all recommendations have been addressed.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Paterson, Washington facility plans to respond to releases of the covered process chemical, anhydrous ammonia, and therefore has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP has been reviewed with the Paterson Fire Department and Benton County Emergency Services.  The purpose of the plan is to establish policies and procedures for protecting the health and safety of employees, contractors, and visitors, and to comply with all applicable federal and state regulations.  Training of employees and contractors includes providing a copy of the plan upon initial employment at Lamb Weston, Inc. and reviewing it for their specific assignment, annual refresher training for current employees, and review for all whenever the plan is changed. In addition, plant evacuation drills are conducted on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nThe plan is comprehensive enough to deal with all types of emergencies specific to the Lamb Weston Paterson, Washington facility and defines the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tPreferred means for reporting fires, hazardous materials incidents, medical, and any other emergencies;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency escape routes and assembly areas;  \r\n\u00bf\tProcedures to account for all employees including contractors and visitors; and\r\n\u00bf\tNames of agencies and persons to contact.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nSafety systems and preventative maintenance measures will be constantly evaluated and improved.  The facility will evaluate recommendations from Process Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequence of an unintentional release."

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP plans work together to assure that potential on-site hazards and off-site consequences are identified and controlled.  All 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program, the EPA requirement for developing an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the RMP submittal are included within the facility's prevention program.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Paterson, Washington processing facility processes various vegetables such as peas, carrots, beans, and corn.  The plant site consists of a main processing plant, refrigerated cold storage, office building, and scale house.  Activities are conducted at this site during all months of the year.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable processing cycle includes a wide array of steps.  The plant purchases the majority of its vegetables from local growers.  Prior to processing, the vegetables are separated by specifications.  The inspected, washed and peeled vegetables are cut, blanched and frozen, then packaged in large totes for transport to a repackaging facility.\r\n\r\nThe covered processes at the facility are closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems.  The ammonia refrigeration systems allows the finished products to be quickly cooled and frozen.  There are two independent refrigeration systems at the facility, both of which have more than the Threshold Quantity (TQ) of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe OSHA PSM component elements are organized as follows: 1) Employees participate in the elements of this safety and release prevention program whenever possible; 2) Ammonia awareness and PSM training is provided to all employees, operators and maintenance personnel receive additional training; 3) Process Safety Information (PSI) is maintained on the covered processes; 4) Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) of the covered processes were conducted and will be periodically reviewed to ensure adequacy of controls; 5) The Mechanical I"
