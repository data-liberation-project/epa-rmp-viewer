Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: TreeHouse Private Brands maintains a\n\ncomprehensive safety, health, and environmental program at the plant. The program includes engineering,\n\neducation, and enforcement provisions for hazard communication, spill prevention and response, hazardous\n\nwaste, universal waste and waste oil management, waste water and storm water management.\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Program: This TreeHouse Private Brands facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance\n\nemergency action plan. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.\n\nDepending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders\n\nand equipment. The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies. The facility has\n\ncommunicated hazard of ammonia with the local fire department and LEPC. The incident commander has\n\nultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n3. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance: TreeHouse Private Brands is a processing plant located at 1905 Country\n\nClub Drive, Carrollton TX. The facility houses a processing plant used for manufacturing, packaging, warehousing and \n\nshipping of refrigerated products. The products require refrigeration for the processing and storage of these products.\n\n\n\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and\n\nalternative release scenarios for the process.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However,\n\nthe facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of anhydrous ammonia quantity\n\nreleased into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety: Based on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia,\n\nlists of action items were developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure th"
