Our isobutane inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs. In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 68 (Risk Management Program Regulations - RMP), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate vapor cloud explosion of, the contents of the isobutane storage tank.  The impact of this explosion was evaluated using EPA's RMP Comp software and resulted in an area of concern which extends 0.3 miles from the storage tank, which is beyond the facility's property boundary and does affect public receptors.  Two alternate release scenarios were also evaluated using RMP Comp-the rupture of a 1 inch pipe from the tank to the process and the rupture of a 4 inch unloading hose caused by truck driver pull away during unloading.  The pipe rupture resulted in an area of concern which extends 0.07 miles from the storage vessel, which is beyond the facility's property boundary and do affect public receptors.  The truck hose rupture area of concern is confined with the facility's property boundary.  The isobutane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58, state law and the Company's insurance carrier.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of a flammable substance, the facility's Plant Emergency Organization policy requires immediate notification of the proper authorities and evacuation of the affected area.  Facility personnel will only take defensive measures prior to evacuation.  This facility's emergency response and contingency plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and loc"

All employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by EPA, OSHA and DOT standards and regulations.\n\nBecause this is a new facility, there have been no accidents with regard to spillage of substances at this facility within the last five years. Nor have there been any accidents with regard to spillage of substances at the parent facility in North Carolina.\n\nNo changes to the procedures or methods of pollution prevention are to be made at this time.  Procedural changes may be implemented in the future if revaluation deems them necessary.\n\nThe PTI facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program as required by 29 CFR 1910.119, and Standard Operating Procedures which outlines various manufacturing steps. This PSM involves training, maintenance, inspections, process safety, chemical information, accident prevention and emergency response procedures."
