The management and employees of the Phoenix facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the storage and distribution of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride is received and stored in high pressure tube trailers that contains 3,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride in each tube.  The hydrogen chloride is then distributed into various DOT containers such as cylinders.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of  a high pressure tube that contains a maximum of 3,000 lb . The results would be a maximum release of 3,000 lbs of refrigerated anhydrous hydrogen chloride over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.03mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 2.4 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 45,953 residents and several special receptors which  the Arizona state Sanitarium, Arizona State Hospital Farm and several schools based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land View III\".

The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and urban topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include several public receptors and businesses based on actual observations.

No passive or active mitigation systems were considered.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and testing of the DOT containers.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of hydrogen chloride.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.  \nWritten process safety information was developed for the hydrogen chloride system to enable managers, supervisors, and employees to identify and understand the process hazards.  This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of hydrogen chloride.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.

Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms.
