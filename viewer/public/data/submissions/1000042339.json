This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  The personnel at the facility work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and appropriately to an emergency that may occur at our facility.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant is located 46 miles east of Rock Springs, Wyoming  and 4.5 miles south of Interstate 80.  The facility operates several processes including compression, dehydration, cryogenic liquids recovery, and hydrocarbon fractionation to recover hydrocarbon liquids from the gas supplied by multiple wells in the area.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue methane gas stream, ethane, liquefied propane, liquefied butane and liquid condensate containing pentanes and heavier liquids.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not use, produce or store any reportable quantities of materials considered toxic.  \n\n\n\nThe plant does store hydrocarbons in pressurized storage tanks in excess of 10,000 lbs.  Using the RMP Comp program, the predicted radius of 1 lb overpressure is 0.5 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors "

For this reason, this facility is considered a Program level 1 facility under the guidelines of the RMP program.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases that did or reasonably could have caused offsite impacts in the past five years as described in the Risk Management Rule (40CFR68.10(b)(1)).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\n \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP), the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant provides and requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee include all aspects of the PSM standard including, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, writing procedures, participating on a process hazard analysis (PHA) team, reviewing Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews, accident investigation, management of change (MOC) emergency response drills, mechanical integrity inspections, writing permits to work and surveying the area for the issuance of hot work permits.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program and is maintained at the gas plant. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues.  These include an observation program requiring "

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals and written procedures.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant uses the Haz-Op and What if/Checklist hazard techniques to perform the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to perform these evaluations.  These reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All recommendations are approved and implemented, modified and implemented or rejected with an explanation of why and what other measures will be implemented to address the teams concerns.  The final resolution of all findings or recommendations is documented and retained with the PHA.  \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Patrick Draw Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations fundamentals and how those apply to the specific processes in the Patrick Draw Gas Plant.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through testing and skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with; 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, and 5) safe and hot work permits as required. Plant personnel evaluate and document the safety performance of all contractors while they are on site. In addition the Patrick Draw Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor using a company run Contractor Assessment Program.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new process or modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Patrick Draw Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  One OEM or better parts are ordered to assure that repairs or maintenance activities do not diminish the intended use of the equipment.  Management of change procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are used to document any deviation from replacements in kind.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Patrick Draw Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
