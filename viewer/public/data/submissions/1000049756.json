Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with NORTH CHARLESTON FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products. We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Chlorine, Aqua Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide Solution) and Ethylenediamine. Chlorine and Ethylenediamine is received prepackaged in containers, warehoused and resold to our customers. Aqua Ammonia is packaged at this facility in drums and totes directly from our vendor tanker trailers.  Aqua Ammonia containers are stored on-site at our facility for subsequent distribution to our customers.   The maximum intended inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 15,000 lbs., Aqua Ammonia - 175,000 lbs. and Ethylenediamine - 75,000 lbs. \r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at\r\nour stationary source. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Informatio"
