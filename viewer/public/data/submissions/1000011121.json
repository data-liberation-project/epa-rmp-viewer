      "SummaryText": "Trident Seafoods Corporation has implemented the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP, which included written descriptions of all elements for these program requirements.  To strive for a coordinated and effective program particular persons have been identified and assigned responsibility for carrying out the requirements of each element.  There is a single person identified as having overall responsibility for these programs.  Most all of the program elements are reviewed annually to keep the program current with personnel training and system requirements.  The entire program is reviewed at least every 3 years in a complete documentation compliance audit review.  A follow-up report of the audit is generated to improve any program elements found, or felt to need improvement.  A process hazard analysis is done for the entire system every five years.  A follow-up report is also generated for the hazard analysis to further improve the safety and integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Trident Seafoods intent that the PSM/RMP for the Wrangell, Alaska facility be a living document that is used, reviewed, and improved as needed to assure the safety of the employees, the public, and the environment.  \n\nRelease Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a A?Worse CaseA? release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.  The alternative releases were in most cases releases that were of potential concern as determined in the A?Process Hazard AnalysisA? of the system and facility.  The information generated from the consideration of the worse and alternative releases is used in developing the emergency action plan for the facility, and for coordination with local emergency responders.  \n\nFive year release history A? No Releases\nThis system has not had any reportable releases of ammonia in the last five year period.  If any actual release occurred,"

      "SummaryText": " or even a near miss, an incident investigation would be done to determine the cause, and to find means or methods to reduce the possibility of a similar future occurrence.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nTrident Seafoods Wrangell, Alaska facility has a written A?Emergency Action PlanA? that will be followed in the event of any type of emergency, including an ammonia release.  Many of the operating personnel have been trained to the Hazmat Technician level, and do receive annual refresher training, but they will only do A?defensiveA? actions in the event of an ammonia release.  The facility works with the local emergency responders on an annual basis to assure good coordination between on-site and off-site resource for an ammonia release as well as other emergency.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvement\n This facility holds monthly safety meetings with all Management Staff, Lead Personnel and other team members where all aspects of safety are discussed in regards to improving and maintaining a safe work environment.  Minutes of these meetings are kept and used to monitor progress toward safety improvement of any items discussed and agreed upon.  Systems and procedures are reviewed and updated; in many cases at least annually to assure that all operations are being done is a safe and effective manner.\n"
