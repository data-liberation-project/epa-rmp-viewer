      "SummaryText": "THATCHER COMPANY OF NEW YORK began operations in Williamson New York in 1990.  Initially, the company started out with only a handful of employees.  Operations have expanded over the years and currently the company employs about 30 people.  Most of the employees live in the immediate area.\n\nThe facility itself is an old fruit processing plant that was formerly owned by Seneca Foods.  The facility building has ample room for continued growth with over 140,000 square feet under roof.  \n\nTHATCHER COMPANY OF NEW YORK is a diversified growing chemical business which provides its employees with many opportunities to advance.  The company has four major business areas: (1) chemical manufacturing, (2) chemical distribution, (3) chemical compounding, and (4) chemical repackaging.  Our products include a variety of chemical specialties such as construction industry additives, water treatment chemicals, and photo chemicals.  We also blend, compound, and repackage for our customers.  Our products are sold throughout the USA and Canada.\n\nThe facility currently uses sulfur dioxide in the manufacturing process for some of its photo chemicals.  Even though the facility does not currently use anhydrous ammonia, it has used it in the past and has plans to begin using it again in the future.  It will also be used in the photo chemical manufacturing process.  Because of the toxicity of these two chemicals, the EPA and OSHA have promulgated addition regulations in an effort to avoid accidental releases from occurring that would have an adverse effect on the general population and environment.   These regulations involve a detailed analysis of the process, equipment, training, and procedures used for handling and storage of these materials.  The analysis involves technical people and members of management as well as the operators that actually work with the materials.  Thatcher Company of New York has invested a large amount of resources in order to comply with these regulations.  In add"

      "SummaryText": "ition to the large amount of time invested by its own employees, the company also retained a consultant to help compile all of the necessary data and documentation.  \n\nAs a result of the process hazard analysis (PHA) of the two chemicals mentioned above, several redundant safety systems were installed.  The safety systems are both manual and automatically activated.  The safety systems consist of sensors that are capable of detecting the anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide when they are present in the work area or scrubber system.  These sensors are connected to valves that are located on the supply side of the process and will automatically shut down the supply if certain limits are exceeded.  The valves can also be activated manually at seven different locations throughout the plant and office.  \n\nIn addition to the gas sensors, there are pressure sensors and temperature sensors that have been installed at different locations in the process to detect conditions that would be outside of the normal operating range.  These sensors, like the gas sensors, are also tied into the valves located at the supply source.  \n\nThere is also constant visual monitoring of the anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide supply sources whenever they are used in the manufacturing process. \n\nMany standard operating procedures (SOP?s) have been written that cover every aspect of the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.  These SOP?s include topics such as training, hooking up and unloading of the chemicals, manufacturing practices, equipment operation and maintenance, analytical and QC procedures, and specific safety requirements.  \n\nIn addition to the many SOP?s, there are many hours of classroom and on-the-job training that are given to all operators that work with these processes.  All employees receive orientation classroom training that covers the basic safety information and procedures needed to work around hazardous chemicals.  Each of the operators that work w"

      "SummaryText": "ith anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide, receives an additional 40-hour hazardous materials training class and 8-hour refresher trainer each year after that.  These operators also maintain first aid and CPR certification by the American Red Cross.   \n\nThe company is committed to providing a safe environment in which its employee?s work and its neighbors live.  It maintains a proactive and positive relationship with the town officials and LEPC.  Every year as part of the Community Awareness Program (CAP), the General Manager or one of the company officers provides a report at a scheduled town meeting.  This report summarizes our current business status, accident history, current regulatory compliance status, emergency contacts, safety improvements, and site security.  In addition to the CAP report, a representative from the company regularly attends the LEPC meetings and joint training sessions.  A copy of the company?s emergency response plan (ERP) is maintained on file at the LEPC as well as the local fire department.  \n\nThe company has an excellent safety record handling both anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide.  There have been no reportable releases of these two chemicals in the last 5 years.  In an effort to insure that this continues, the company regularly reviews and updates both SOP?s and the training given to its employees.  With the development of recent world events, it also is acutely aware of the importance of site security.  This will continue to be a focus of attention for the company in the future."
