      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required by both federal and state requirements for the chlorination system used at the City of Springfield Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  Water treatement uses chlorine as a disinfectant to purify the City's drinking water.  Chlorinators, used in the process, are designed to control and meter the flow of chlorine gas, mix the chlorine with water and deliver the resultant water solution to the point of application.  Chlorine is stored in 1-ton cylinders, which are specifically designed to prevent leaks.  The cylinders are equipped with protective valve caps to prevent an inadvertent release and the valves are recessed into the end of the cylinder to protect them from being damaged during shipment or unloading.  On the average, six (6) cylinders are stored in the chlorine process room.  Only two (2) of these cylinders are actually connected to the chlorinators at any one time.  The remaining four (4) cylinders are nested in cradles designed to prevent their movement.  The cradles are backed up against a brick wall to prevent a cylinder from self-propelling should a valve malfunction.  The two (2) cylinders connected to the chlorinators are controlled electronically by a central computer system, which regulates the amount of chlorine mixed in the water.  The chlorinator operates under a vacuum produced by the flow of water.  Chlorine gas under pressure enters the chlorinator where it is electrically heated to reduce deposits of impurities and to prevent reliquefaction of the gas when the chlorinator is shut down with the chlorine supply turned off.  A chlorine gas detector continuously monitors the chlorine process room.  A sample of air is continuously withdrawn from within the room for the presence of chlorine.  In the event of a chlorine gas leak, which gives rise to the presence of as little as 1ppm chlorine, the chloralert will activate the alarm circuit, all interconnected safety devices which includes the ventilation system, alarm"
