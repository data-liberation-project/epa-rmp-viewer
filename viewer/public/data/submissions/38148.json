The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine is a 3/8\" pipe break resulting in a release of 1,560 pounds over a 120 minute period.

Plant personnel blocked in the disconnect and the truck to prevent additional release.  There were three inhalation and eye-related injuries to two Terra personnel working the area and to the driver of the truck who was waiting in the loading area for the truck to be loaded.  No off-site impacts occurred.  Upon investigation of the incident it was discovered that the check valve in the loading hose did not operate properly and changes were made to the process to use an excess flow valve in the piping just prior to the loading hose.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Woodward Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Response Program which includes a written plan that is coordinated with local authorities, a 60-plus member emergency response team, and emergency notification system that utilizes both in-plant sirens and the Community Alert Network telephone system.  Woodward Plant personnel are active members of the Woodward County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
