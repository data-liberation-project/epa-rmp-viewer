The Ohio River borders the site on the north. The area south of the site is wooded hillsides. The nearest residence is approximately one half mile away. There are no schools or hospitals within three miles of the site. \n\nCurrently, there are 206 NOVA employees working at the site, in manufacturing, technology and administrative jobs, in addition to contract employees working at the site in a temporary capacity.   \n\nThe Beaver Valley site is a global leader in the production of plastic resin for polystyrene foams and heat resistant engineering resins. The major products are expandable polystyrene (EPS) and Dylark engineering resins.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nNOVA Chemicals is a member of the American Chemistry Council and is a Responsible Care Company.\n\nThe Beaver Valley site's approach to chemical safety and accidental release prevention is best described by the NOVA Chemicals Responsible Care Policy which states: \n\nNOVA Chemicals is committed to being a leader in achieving and maintaining superior Responsible Care performance.  The following principles reflect the ethic of Responsible Care and guide our conduct worldwide.  We will:\n\nA?Operate in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and adhere to the    following: NOVA ChemicalsA? internal health, safety, environmental and security standards; local health, safety, environmental and security standards; and the chemical industryA?s Responsible Care requirements.\nA?Manage our business on the premise that all incidents that could result in harm to people, property or the environment can be prevented.\nA?Provide leadership to ensure all employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and are provided with the training and support necessary to integrate Responsible Care principles into t"

Expandable Polystyrene (EPS) and ARCEL are the main products manufactured at the Beaver Valley Site.\n\nN-pentane and iso-pentane are used in the D3 / D4 process areas to produce EPS.  The D2 process area uses iso-pentane to produce ARCEL.  The D2 process area is on the East Side of the site and the D3/D4 process area is on the West End of the site. Both n-pentane and iso-pentane are delivered to the site in nominal 30,000-gallon capacity rail tank cars.\n\nIn the D2 area, iso-pentane is stored in a maximum amount of 8,500 gallons (44,200 pounds) in a 10,000-gallon capacity storage tank.  This tank supplies the D2 area with all of its iso-pentane requirements.\n \nIn the D3/D4 area, n-pentane is stored at a maximum amount of 130,000 gallons (682,500 pounds) in a 250,000-gallon capacity storage sphere. In another tank farm area adjacent to the D3/D4 process area, iso-pentane is stored at a maximum amount of 11,200 gallons (58,300 pounds). In the same tank farm area, cyclopentane is stored in a 20,000-gallon capacity storage tank at a maximum amount of 16,000 gallons (84,000 pounds). A third tank, also in the same storage area, contains a mixture of iso-pentane and cyclopentane in a 20,000-gallon capacity tank at a maximum amount of 16,000 gallons (84,000 pounds). \n\nFacility Accidental Release Prevention Programs, Emergency Response Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes previously described are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. All 14 elements required under the PSM Standard are in place at the site and have been integrated into the prevention plan requirements under the Risk Management Program. Compliance with the PSM Standard provides the foundation for compliance with the Risk Management Program, and there is a continuous effort to maintain and improve our compliance programs related to PSM.\n\nSome of the specific prevention measures in"

There are on-going equipment inspection programs in place to monitor mechanical integrity. The tanks are protected by firewater deluge systems. Area classifications are required to guard against the introduction of ignition sources into the processes. There are hydrocarbon sensors and alarms in the area to detect pentane releases.  The site's liquid handling technicians continuously monitor pentane unloading operations.  \n\nIt should be noted that all of our storage vessels are included in our Mechanical Integrity Inspection Program.  Procedures are in place to conduct inspections periodically by qualified personnel to reduce the risk of vessel failure.\n\nTo further improve site safety and emergency preparedness, the Beaver Valley Site coordinates its emergency response plan with the Beaver County Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). The site conducts emergency response training that incorproates support from outside agency responders, including several volunteer fire departments.  The site's Process Safety Engineer maintains close communication with the Beaver County LEPC coordinator on a regular basis and is a member of the LEPC.\n"
