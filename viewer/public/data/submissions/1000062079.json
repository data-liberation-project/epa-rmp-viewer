The facility was built in 1987; an expansion and upgrade project was completed in the latter part of 2011.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables (produce) and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage. The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and subsequent short-term storage is on-site generally four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods beginning in mid-November and finishing in early April. \r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves. At certain times of the year portable cooling equipment is required to augment the fixed equipment at the facility. Due to the seasonal operation of the Plant, the majority of ammonia refrigerant is removed and placed in storage vessels at the end of each season.  The vessels are provided shade, traffic barriers and a water sprinkler syste"

Production workers contracted by YEX2 are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant's Emergency Action Plan. Only the Yuma Fire Department would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards. Emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS. Written ammonia emergency procedures are detailed in the facility's Thirty Minute Plan. Appropriate written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis. Local Emergency Response capabilities have been verified.  The Yuma Fire Department performs periodic facility reviews and interviews to coordinate emergency response.\r\n  \r\n \r\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nMechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\r\n - Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\r\n - Compliance Audits;\r\n - Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\r\n - IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections  (IIAR minimum safety criteria for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration process);\r\n - WPS Inspection Protocol\r\n - Incident Investigation Reports\r\n\r\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.

Tasks are then tracked to completion through the service call system.  Through a regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, YEX2 and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the potential for releases.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now used as a permissive for oil drain flow. If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated. The facility uses these types of valves at each  oil drain point.\r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at YEX2 - Site #2:\r\n - The facility has fencing and gates to limit access to the facility and to increase the security of the facility from potential wrong-doers.\r\n - A Security Service is employed on-site to control casual visitors (truck drivers reporting to pick-up produce).  \r\n - CCTV's are employed for site monitoring\r\n - An ammonia monitoring, sensing and warning system is installed.\r\n - An Ammonia-Water Diffusion System was installed under supervision of the Yuma Fire Dept.\r\n - There is a controlled pressure receiver installed for daily operational swing capacity.\r\n - An evaporative cooling water sprinkler system is installed over the site's high pressure receiver vessel.
