      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nNestle Dreyer's Ice Cream utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a closed-loop refrigeration system for the production of ice cream and frozen dessert products.  Since the main refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream Company has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) / Risk Management Program (RMP) for the ammonia refrigeration process.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM / RMP program, Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration system, conducted a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration system is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream promotes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific and process specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream facility is located at 970 East Continental Avenue in Tulare, California. The facility is located approximately 0.2 miles east of California Highway 99 and 1.6 miles south of Highway 137.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of commercial, agricultural, and residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe plant began operation in April 1985.

In 2013 a large project was completed to upgrade and replace aging system components.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Nestle Dreyer's Ice Cream facility is a closed-loop system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The systems, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of ice cream.\n\n\n\nNestle Dreyer's Ice Cream conducted an ammonia inventory study of the main refrigeration system to determine the ammonia charge in the system after the completion of the 2005 expansion project.  The results of the ammonia inventory study indicated that the total ammonia charge of the ammonia system was then approximately 51,405 pounds.  The ammonia system charge has been calculated periodically since 2005.  The last calculation was in August of 2013 using the IRC Model and showed that the charge of the main system was approximately 49,355 pounds.  High Pressure Receiver #2 (HPR 02) is the largest vessel in the main refrigeration system and can store the entire charge of ammonia for that system.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.

Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n?    Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n?    Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n?    A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n?    A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n?    A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n?    Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n?    Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\n\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety.
