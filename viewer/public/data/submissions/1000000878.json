Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine InstituteA?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers is subject to RMP Program Level 2.  \nNote: this facility has recently stopped filling chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers from rail cars, and therefore the amount stored is considerably less than in previous years.  This facility was previously subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention "

      "SummaryText": "program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\nA summary of our Prevention Program\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION A? Our facilities maintain current copies of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  In addition, this facility has current copies of all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.  Much of the information in these pamphlets is applicable to the storage of sulfur dioxide also.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW A? A hazard review is conducted for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide container storage process at least every 5 years.  We primarily use a checklist prepared by the Chlorine Institute which is relevant to our operations.  At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in this review.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES A? We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of storage and movement of containers.\n\nTRAINING A? All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 5 or 3 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to those chemicals.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nMAINTENANCE A? Container storage is the only process for RMP chemicals at this facility.  We perform a visual inspection of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the forklift tr"

      "SummaryText": "ucks used to move containers.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION A? We have an Incident Investigation SOP which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as A?near-missesA? that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by Corporate safety personnel and are shared with all facilities within the company.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT A? A compliance audit is conducted at least every 3 years to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nIn the past 5 years, this facility has had one accident that met the criteria for reporting in this section:\n\nOn December 13, 2007, a chlorine release of about 18 pounds was caused when an operator did not follow proper startup procedures.  Valves that had been opened to perform necessary maintenance were not closed before startup, introducing liquid chlorine into a section of piping not designed for that condition, and leading to piping failure.  Automatic control equipment detected the leak shutting off automatic valves and minimizing the amount released.  As a result of the release, about 30 people temporarily evacuated nearby businesses as a precaution.  We retrained personnel and changed procedures to have valves double checked before startup.  Furthermore, we recently stopped packaging operations at this facility and now only store toxic gases in containers filled elsewhere.  This eliminates the possibility of the same type of release from happening again at this facility.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilityA?s emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine InstituteA?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required."

We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only.  We will not respond to other types of emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1977.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  Within the last 6 months, this facility stopped the packaging of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from rail cars into smaller containers.  We now only store these materials in transportation containers filled elsewhere.  This change greatly reduces the amount stored and eliminates the opportunities for most types of accidents.  \n\nThere are no specific additional safety improvements planned at this time but we anticipate making more security improvements as we develop our Security Plan in accordance with Department of Homeland Security requirements.  \n\n"
