      "SummaryText": "HALOCARBON PRODUCTS CORPORATION\r\n\r\nHalocarbon Products Corporation's plant is located on about 100 acres in the North Augusta Industrial Park at street address 1100 Dittman Court.  Construction of the plant began in 1982 and shipping of product from the state-of-the-art facility began in 1986.  The plant employs about 190 highly skilled people from the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nHalocarbon Products Corporation manufactures fluorinated specialty chemicals including lubricants used for oxygen and aggressive chemical service, flotation fluids used in gyroscopes, acids for agricultural chemicals, alcohols used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and the generic inhalation anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane.  To produce these products, Halocarbon needs various chemicals on-site.  These chemicals do not pose any unusual hazards when handled and stored properly.  Our employees are trained in identifying and handling the hazards associated with these chemicals in the event of an emergency, such as a fire or spill.\r\n\r\nHalocarbon has divided the plant into three main processing areas.  Area 1 and 2 are on the north side of the building and are for processing flammable materials.  Areas 1 and 2 are separated by fire doors.  Area 3 is located on the south side of the building and is used to process non-flammables.  Area 3 is separated from Areas 1 and 2 by the mechanical equipment area and the centrally located control room. There is also a Semi-Works Plant (SWP) where scale-up operations are performed.  These scale-up operations are conducted in similiar but smaller equipment in comparison to the production plant.\r\n\r\nFour chemicals present at Halocarbon Products Corporation fall under the risk management plan: hydrogen fluoride, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, and trifluorochloroethylene. \r\n\r\nA monitoring alarm is in place at the HF storage area to quickly detect leaks.  A water curtain around the storage area can be used to suppress HF leaks.  In addition, there is an emerge"

      "SummaryText": "ncy dump tank designed to hold the entire contents of the primary HF storage tank.  In the unlikely event of a failure of the primary tank, the contents will be dumped to the dump tank and the water curtain will be started to reduce the amount of HF released from the site.  Both tanks are diked.\r\n\r\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are stored in industry standard ton cylinders.  If a leak were to develop in a cylinder, the cylinder kits (both \"A\" and \"B\") required to stop the release are at Halocarbon.  These kits consist of various tools, plugs and gaskets necessary to stop cylinder leaks. Two emergency ton cylinders are always available and are capable of holding the contents of a  cylinder.   In addition, alkaline material is available to construct a \"tent\" to absorb and neutralize the escaping gas.  Area alarms and monitors specific for chlorine are in place to warn of a leak for quick response.\r\n\r\nThe Trichlorofluoroethylene storage is located in a electrically qualified hazardous location for the storage of flammable materials.  No open flame or spark producing equipment is allowed within 35 feet without a hot work permit.  There are leak detectors for this area.  Loading of the tank is overseen by one of our operators who can perform emergency shutoff of the loading operation.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHalocarbon Products Corporation falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes are closely scrutinized for all aspects of safety in processing and handling.  Whenever a new process is planned or an existing process is modified, a team of highly trained professionals and certified operators hold a formal, structured review of the project.  Any potential problems identified during the review are investigated.  The team must be satisfied with the outcome of these investigations before the project can proceed.  To ensure complete employee involvement, comments are requested from plant operators.  These comments also must be addr"

      "SummaryText": "essed by the team.  Many times a pre-start up safety review is done prior to starting a new or modified process.  This review includes a tour of the process by a team of trained employees to be sure the process is installed correctly.  The team also must be satisfied that standard operating procedures, training and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the process chemicals are complete.  Any incidents in a PSM process are reviewed routinely to see if process improvements are needed.\r\n\r\nPrior to an operator being certified on a PSM process, he must pass a test about that process.  In order to ensure that operators keep up with process changes, each operator must make a presentation before their peers and managers every year discussing the process, the chemicals handled and how they operate the process.  This operator certification program has worked well for Halocarbon in preventing incidents and releases.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the possibility of spilled chemicals getting into the environment, all process areas and truck loading areas are contained.  If there is a spill, the contained material can be reused or properly disposed.\r\n\r\nOutside storage tanks are diked.  If a spill occurs, the material collects in the dike.  It is then drained or pumped from the dike to a recovery drum.  There are no automatic pumps in the dikes for rainwater, reducing the possibility of accidentally pumping spilled material to the environment.\r\n\r\nHalocarbon uses, stores and ships chemicals in high pressure cylinders.  These cylinders are hydrostatically tested on a regular basis.  Halocarbon has the capability to stop leaks from these cylinders and practices response to a leaking cylinder as part of regular training.\r\n\r\nAs part of our emergency response plan, Halocarbon maintains the following equipment:\r\n\r\n          Self-contained breathing apparatus\r\n          Level A response gear\r\n          Level B response gear\r\n          Level C response gear\r\n          Air line respirators\r\n          Em"

If the system detects a leak, an alarm sounds in the control room.  All operators are trained in steps to take in responding to a leak alarm, including annual response drills for a stimulated leak.  Security cameras are in place to assist with real time visual observation of the plant and chemical storage areas.\r\n\r\nCONTINGENCY PLAN AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nThis plan involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.

The operators demonstrate their ability to handle emergencies via our emergency drills.  Periodically, management arrives at the plant unexpected at an off hour, activates an alarm, hands the responders a scenario and records the response of that shift.  This is done for each of the four shifts.  The drill is video taped and then reviewed and critiqued by each shift during our regular safety meetings.  Lessons learned are made part of the safety meeting.  Each operations shift must attend 24 hours of safety meetings per year.  These meetings include discussions and hands-on training on subjects such as:\r\n\r\n          Chlorine cylinder A and B kits\r\n          Repairing a leaking cylinder\r\n          Level A gear drill"

Each report is investigated to determine the cause so as to prevent the same incident happening again.  These reports are kept in a file and the more serious incidents are discussed with the employees during safety meetings.  During the past 5 years, Halocarbon has had an good record of not releasing chemicals to the environment.  This is attributed to the intensive training the operators receive during the year.  This training is continuously up-dated and increased to make Halocarbon the best partner the community can have."
