In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\nFacility Information: \n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 115111, \"Support Activities for Crop Production\". We provide agricultural inputs for crop production that include receiving, and storing product incidental to fertilizer processing.\n\n\n\nFor approximately one week per year, Anhydrous Ammonia may be included in a process (T-Reactor) of blending to make 10-34-0 starter grade of liquid fertilizer. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs. The maximum on site vessel is 30,000 gallons, storing 131,325 Lbs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the offloading of a semi trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and processing. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation. \n\n\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\n The \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.

Transfer hoses are protected by manual, and self-closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off-loading transportation equipment). The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: excess flow valves, emergency shut-off valves, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on anhydrous ammonia. We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that may require evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our compa"
