Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Tucker Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Tucker Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 100 million pounds of latex.  Latex is sold primarily to customers who use the material in the making of latex interior and exterior paints and coatings.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Tucker Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Tucker Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at levels above the threshold amounts: \n7 Acrylonitrile\n7 Vinyl Acetate\n\nThe Tucker plant has no RMP-regulated flammable substances.\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur"

The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\nThis scenario assumes an catastrophic release of the entire contents of the acrylonitrile storage tank. This would result in a release of  73,900 pounds of acrylonitrile. Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 95 percent (73,900 pounds).  According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. Specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring and to mitigate the effects should they occur include:\n7 Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 95 percent (73,900 pounds).\n7 Secondary Containment:  The tank and is located in an above-ground, concrete secondary containment structure and is connected to the spill containment basin. The spill containment basin consists of a poured, steel-reinforced concrete floor with poured steel- reinforced concrete walls. Cast in place where the walls meet the floor slab is a rubber water stop to prevent lateral leakage of any released material. The spill containment is covered and large enough to hold the contents of the acrylonitrile tank. \n7 Reaction Prevention: Systems are in place to ensure reactivity of material stored in the tank is inhibited.\n7 Equipment Design and Construction: Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n7 Pressure relief systems: Pressure relief systems help to ensure that over-pressures within tanks are mitigated.\n7 Hydrocarbon Detectors:  This system is designed to continuously detect the presence of hydrocarbons from a storage tank and sound an alarm, so that appropriate action, such as actuation of the deluge system, can be taken.\n7 Emergency S"

The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Tucker Plant routinely practices emergency drills and includes the Dekalb County Fire and Rescue Department when possible. In addition to the plant emergency drills, the plant sponsors at least two Dekalb county firemen to Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) training when offered.
