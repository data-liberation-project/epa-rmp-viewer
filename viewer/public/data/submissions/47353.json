      "SummaryText": "     North American Warehousing Company warehouses a variety of chemical compounds for its clients.  Specifically, it warehouses epichlorohydrin in quantities over 20,000 lbs, thus making it subject to Part 68 requirements.  The facility meets the requirements for Program 2.\n\n     Epichlorohydrin is received by truck in 55-gallon drums, stored, and reshipped in the same containers.  Worst-case and alternate scenarios were derived from the US EPA Guidance for Warehousing operations.  The worst-case scenario involves the spillage of the entire contents of one 55-gallon drum (the largest single container for epichlorohydrin), the formation of a pool one centimeter deep, and the evaporation of the entire pool.  The alternate scenario involves piercing two drums simultaneously with the tines of a fork lift truck, and the evaporation of the entire contents.\n\n     All operations are conducted inside the building at this facility, including loading and unloading trucks.  The building enclosure serves as passive mitigation.  The toxic endpoint is determined as 0.1 mile for the worst-case scenario, and less than 0.1 mile for the alternate scenario.\n\n     North American Warehousing has a Risk Management Program that is fully implemented.  There has not been an accident  involving a spill in the history of the current management, and none in the last 5 years."
