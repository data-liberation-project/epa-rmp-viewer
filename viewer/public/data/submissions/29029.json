The mill also operates a pulp dryer to produce baled pulp for internal use and for sale to external customers.\n\nWaste water is treated and discharged to the main channel of the Columbia River.  The clarifier, aeration ponds and waste fiber landfill are located on Lady Island, a 476 acre site separated from the mill by the Camas Slough.\n\nThe Camas Mill employs 1160 people from the local area as well as from the neighboring cities of Vancouver, Washington and Portland, Oregon.  Most processes operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week and 52 weeks per year.  Production equipment is shut down during scheduled maintenance downs for maintenance, or curtailed during periods of low market demand.  The entire facility is shut down periodically for large scale maintenance and cleaning.\n\nRegulated Substances and Processes\n\nChlorine dioxide is produced in the Lurgi and R8 chlorine dioxide generators for use in the mill bleach plants.  The chemical is produced as a 0.9% solution; for purposes of this report, the concentration used for calculation of worst case and alternate case scenarios  is 1.4%, as analyses have shown that solution concentration may reach that level at certain parts of the process.\n\n\nES.3  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AT THE CAMAS MILL\n\nThe Camas Mill Accident Prevention program has been developed to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, as administered by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).\n\nThe Process Safety Management program, or PSM, is comprised of fourteen (14) different elements, each of which contributes to the health and safety of the workers whose jobs require them to be in direct contact with hazardous chemicals.  The mill has three qualified PSM coordinators managing the program.  In addition to the three coordinator positions, a Process Safety Management Steering Committee meets once per"

      "SummaryText": "This revision of the Fort James Camas LLC Camas Mill Risk Management plan is being made to document the reduction of hazardous chemical use at the mill; specifically, the elimination of elemental chlorine from  mill processes.\n\nES.1  FORT JAMES CAMAS LLC POLICIES ON ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nCorporate Commitment\n\nThe management and employees of the Fort James Camas LLC Camas Mill are committed to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety.  Management systems have been developed, and are continually upgraded, to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community or the environment.  \n\nES.2  DESCRIPTION OF THE CAMAS MILL. REGULATED SUBSTANCES AND REGULATED PROCESSES\n\nMill Description\n\nThe Fort James Camas Mill is located on 185 acres adjacent to the Columbia River in Clark County, Washington.  The mill first began operation in 1883, when it was constructed to supply newsprint for the Portland area.\n\nThe mill currently produces cut size, tissue, toweling and communication papers.  Raw materials in the form of wood chips, sawdust, waste paper and pulp arrive from all over the Northwest by truck, barge and rail car.\n\nThe Camas Mill uses the kraft pulping process to convert wood chips and sawdust into brown kraft pulp.  The pulp is then bleached in either of two bleach plantswhich employ chlorine dioxide and peroxide to whiten pulp.  The paper produced at the mill contains a blend of this pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper.\n\nPaper is made on eight different machines.  Six of the machines produce towel and tissue grades; two produce communication papers.  The oldest machine dates from 1910, and the newest from 1984.  Daily production ranges from 30 tons per day on the smallest to over 600 tons per day on the newest and largest.  Rolls of paper from machines are sold directly to p"

The team is made up of hourly and salaried employees and oversees the implementation of all aspects of the PSM program at the mill.\n\n\nES.7  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AT THE CAMAS MILL\n\nThe Camas Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program, which is intended to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, that could result in a release of a regulated substance.  Procedures are also included for responding to a potential fire or explosion involving  flammable substances.\n\nThe mill employs a full-time emergency response team, which is fully qualified to respond to all hazardous materials events.  Mill personnel are trained in the use of Integrated Command System protocols for responding to emergency situations, and drills are conducted annually to test the ability to respond to spill events.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the City of Camas Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with local emergency response officials, local government officials, independent response contractors and industry representatives."
