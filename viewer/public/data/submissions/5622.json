The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Specialty Brands employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\nSpecialty Brands management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nSpecialty Brands operates a frozen foods manufacturing facility at this location.  Specialty food products (e.g., burritos, taquitos) are prepared, packaged and frozen at the facility for wholesale distribution.  Specialty Brands operates cooking kettles, fryers, ovens, food conveying and handling systems, and packaging equipment.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, cold storage, equipment maintenance department, and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.  Cold storage facilities are supported by two ammonia refrigeration systems: Sullair Plant #1; and Reco Plant #2.  The Sullair and Reco Plant process description, inventory, and drawings are located in the Process Safety Management Program document, Section 2. \nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\nRMP regulations require that each facility identify worst-case and alternat"

      "SummaryText": "ive case release scenarios.  EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel that contains a regulated substance in a 10-minute period.  This release rate is then evaluated using modeling techniques and/or reference tables to define the distance to a specified endpoint (concentration or overpressure).  The distance to the endpoint is affected by several factors including molecular weight, volatility, heat of combustion, and physical setting (urban or rural).\nThe alternative release scenario must be one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario is also evaluated to define the distance to the specified endpoint.\nUnder 40 CFR 68 Subpart B '68.22(e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be used in the hazard assessment to determine the physical setting of the site, urban or rural.  \"Urban means there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees.  Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\"\nDue to the presence of buildings, trees, hills, and/or other structures in the immediate vicinity of the Riverside, California facility, an urban dispersion environment was assumed.\nAmmonia\nThe data provided in the document \"Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration\" (May 1996) was used to estimate the toxic endpoint distance for the worst-case and alternative ammonia release scenarios.  The EPA's \"RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance\" (May 1996) was not used to determine the toxic endpoint since it classifies ammonia as a neutrally buoyant gas.  Since the worst-case ammonia release would involve liquid and would come from a pressurized system containing liquid; the released gas should be classified as a dense gas (a result of evaporative cooling).

This release translates to a release of 14,098 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes or 1,410 lbs/min.  Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the ammonia is a liquefied gas; the high pressure receiver number 1 is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environment is characterized as urban; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable).  The results of the worst-case assessment for ammonia show that the plume must travel 1.38 miles (2.22 kilometers) before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm.\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the ammonia systems is a release from a condenser relief valve due to overpressure of a compressor unit.  The relief valve most likely to vent, based on prior experience, was used in this scenario.  The Large Reco Tower pressure relief valve has a relief rate of 57.7 pounds of air per minute.  As a matter of convention, the specified release rate of any relief valve is always in pounds of air per minute.  The release rate of 57.7 pounds of air per minute correlates to a release rate of 41.4 pounds of ammonia vapor per minute.\nThe ammonia refrigeration document provides calculated endpoint distances for typical meteorological conditions (3 m/s wind speed, D atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity).  It has been determined, through a review of Specialty Brands operational history, that the total release would likely be 200 pounds of ammonia.  Based on the release rate of 41.4 lbs/min, the duration for a 200-pound release is approximately 5 minutes.  Other assumptions include that no active or passive mitigation me"

The results of the alternative-release scenario for an ammonia release indicates that the endpoint concentration of 200 ppm is reached at 0.06 miles (0.095 kilometers) from the release point.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Riverside, California facility is governed by a set of California, OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public and to the environment.  These regulations include:\n* California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program\n* Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Part 119 (29 CFR Part 119), Process Safety Management\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n* 40 CFR Part 355, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key concepts in Specialty Brands release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Specialty Brands management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia system.  Specialty Brands employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nSpecialty Brands policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Specialty Brands maintains a computerized program of preventative maintenance activities"

Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Specialty Brands conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of Specialty Brands emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\nFive Year Accident History\nIt is a policy of the Specialty Brands Riverside facility to investigate any release of ammonia into the workplace or the environment.  In the recent five-year history, Specialty Brands has not had a release of ammonia from the Riverside, California facility that has adversely affected the public or the environment.\nEmergency Response Program\nSpecialty Brands is in the process of training personnel in emergency response at the facility.  The onsite emergency response personnel will be selected and trained by December 1999.  These personnel will receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.  The Riverside Fire Department will remain as the facility's emergency response team until Specialty Brands completes selection and training their onsite emergency response personnel.\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSpecialty Brands completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems each time a design change is implemented and every five years from the date of the initial process hazards analysis. Specialty Brands is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
