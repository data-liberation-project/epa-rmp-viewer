The general accidental release prevention program:\nThe Linde facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. The acetylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the Linde Inc. facility in Roseville, Minnesota.\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\nOn October 10, 2022, an Acetylene WQ safety plug blew out at our Linde facility at Roseville, MN. It was found that the threads for the fuse plug was cross threaded therefore resulting in the ejection of the fuse plug.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our acetylene storage systems, it is Linde Inc.'s policy to immediately notify the Roseville Fire Department and the Linde National Operations Center, who would respond to the emergency. We have communicated this policy with the Roseville Fire Department. All members of the Linde team are properly trained to respond to emergencies at the facility. All employees have access to Linde Emergency Action Plan. Emergency response training, including fire drills, is conducted annually.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process typically derived from employee input as well as corporate directives."

The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Inc. facility located in Roseville, Minnesota complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. All process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA standards. If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Roseville Fire Department and the Linde National Operations Center, who would respond to and assist with the emergency. In addition, we have implemented programs related to Process Safety Management and Security Vulnerability Risk Assessment. Corporate/Senior management provides support for all compliance requirements through training information and training programs. Regula safety meetings are required by corporate policy.\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde facility manufactures acetylene. Acetylene is put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility. The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of Calcium Carbide totes, a low pressure acetylene generator, and a high-pressure cylinder filling area.\n\nAcetylene is compressed using generated acetylene from the process of manufacturing acetylene. The piping from the manifold runs to the generator and compressor room. The supply lines are equipped with flow reducing pressure regulators, 1.2 orifice plates, large flash arrestors, and check valves to protect against reverse flow.\n\nThe acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low-pressure acetylene generator. The low-pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas. The acetylene that is generated in the low-pressure generator is piped to the high-pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed"
