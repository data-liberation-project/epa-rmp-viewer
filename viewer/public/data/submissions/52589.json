The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nPlacer County Dept. of Facilities Services operates numerous wastewater collection systems and two wastewater treatment plants in Placer County.  Its wastewater treatment facility, SMD-1 Wastewater Treatment Plant, is located at 11755 Joeger Rd., Auburn, CA in Placer County, and uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide, for disinfection and dechlorination in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for these RS's.  The facility is located in a suburban area in the Sierra foothills.  There are 12 full-time employees at this site. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored outdoors under a sun shade on rails.  The chlorine is used for odor control of the i"

The sulfur dioxide is used to dechlorinate the disinfected effluent for aquatic toxicity control.  Pressurized gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum at a vacuum regulator valve mounted directly onto the ton container's gas valve.  From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters in chlorinators or  sulfonators located in a separate room, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Placer County Dept. of Facilities Services that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Placer County Dept. of Facilities Services has gathered safety information on chlorine and sulfur dioxide and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Placer County Dept. of Facilities Services are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\nPlacer County Dept. of Facilities Services has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting O"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Placer County Dept. of Facilities Services's operations.  The program and document mangement procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine and sulfur dioxide have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, installing sun shades and seismic hold-downs for containers stored outdoors, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPlacer County Dept. of Facilities Services's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine and sulfur dioxide has been coordinated with Placer County Consolidated Fire District.  This facility is a non responding facility.  CalFire responders have inspected the facility and are familiar with it.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlacer County Dept. of Facilities Services plans to change the treatment chemicals at the SMD-1 Wastewater Treatment Plant to aqueous solution forms, and to eliminate chlorine and sulfur dioxide, at the time of the next plant expansion.  This has been in the planning stage for a few years.  Due to budget constraints and the decision as to whether to regionalize wastewater treatment, no specific date has been set for this expansion.  All of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Placer County Dept. of Facilities Services committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.
