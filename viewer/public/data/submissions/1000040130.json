      "SummaryText": "The Shelby County Commission (SCC) owns the Shelby County South Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) near\r\nWilsonville, Shelby County, Alabama. The SCC has contracted the Southwest Water Company (SWWC), a\r\nprivate company, to operate the SWTP.\r\n\r\nThe SCC and SWWC have reviewed its obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule,\r\nSection 112 of the Clean Air Act) and determined that the facility has a quantity of chlorine that exceeds the\r\nRMP threshold. In response to these requirements, the SCC and SWWC note the following obligations\r\nincumbent on the operations at the SWTP:\r\n\r\n(1) 112 (1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an\r\nowner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to\r\nensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the\r\nsituation. The SCC and SWWC take this obligation seriously, and intend to be not only a good neighbor but\r\nalso a leader in the community safety and emergency preparedness.\r\n\r\n(2) Risk Management Plan - SWWC operates the SWTP which stores and uses chlorine in excess of the\r\nthreshold specified in the RMP Rule. SWWC has developed, and is in the process of further developing and\r\nimplementing, programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event\r\nof a release. These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nBackground - Chlorine is used in the treatment process at the South Water Treatment Plant as a disinfectant.\r\nChlorine is delivered as a compressed liquid in one ton cylinders. There is storage capacity on site to\r\naccommodate 6 cylinders or 12,000 pounds at any given time. As required by the RMP Rule, SWWC has\r\nconsidered the impact of a sudden release of the entire content of one cylinder within a ten-minute period of\r\ntime. SWWC also considered the impact of a more likely release. Key elements from these t"
