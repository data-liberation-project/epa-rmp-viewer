All applicable procedures of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the State and Federal Emergency Response Program requirements.                               \n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Valley Generating Station (GS) is located at 11801 Sheldon Street,  Sun Valley, CA  91352.  The facility is bounded by Glenoaks Boulevard to the northeast; Sheldon Road to the southeast; San Fernando Road to the southwest; and Tujunga Wash, a Los Angeles County Flood Control Channel, beyond which is Branford Street.  The area surrounding the facility is primarily commercial/industrial; however, an emergency clinic, a hospital, and two motels are present on San Fernando Road, approximately 1,900 feet from the aqueous ammonia storage area.  A sand and gravel plant is located adjacent to the northwest of the site.  There are no residences in the immediate vicinity of Valley GS.  The nearest residential properties are located approximately one-half mile to the north.\n\nThe Valley Generating Station (Valley GS) is a 150-acre electric power generating facility designed to generate and supply electric power to the LADWP's system.  This facility consists of four steam generators capable of burning either natural gas or fuel oil, and ranging in capacity from 100 megawatts to 170 megawatts, for a Station total of 540 gross megawatts.  The Station is manned and operated at all times,"

Valley GS has a gate that is manned with a security guard 24 hours per day.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Process Description:\n\nLADWP is installing a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from a 47-MW combustion turbine.  The project includes the installation of an aboveground 20,000-gallon capacity steel storage tank.  The tank is located within a secondary containment area.  The containment  area is equipped with a sump and submersible sump pump to pump out rainwater.  The containment area is designed to hold the contents of each tank as well as account for a 25-year flood scenario.  The aqueous ammonia will be delivered to the site via a 5,000-gallon tanker.  The combustion turbine will be equipped with a SCR unit to control NOx emissions, a combustion byproduct that is a precursor to ozone formation.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Handling and Storage\n\nThe Ammonia Handling and Storage subsystem supplies ammonia solution to the NOx emission control catalyst in the SCR.  Ammonia solution is used instead of anhydrous ammonia because the latter has some serious inherent safety hazards requiring significant precautions and safety equipment in handling and storing.  The risks and safety related costs of anhydrous ammonia are found to outweigh the higher costs for transportation and storage of ammonia solution.\n\nAmmonia solution at 29% concentration (29% ammonia and 71% water) is stored in the 20,000 gallon, aboveground storage tank.  The maximum inventory is 15,000 gallons  (75% fill capacity).  The storage tank is located within a secondary containment area that is 35 feet wide by 30 feet long, and a 6-foot high concrete wall.  Two positive displacement pumps, each fully redundant, dispense ammonia solution to the emission control equipment at a normal flow rate of 115 pounds per hour and a pressure of 40 pounds per square in"

Other safety equipment associated with the tank are: pressure/vacuum relief valves, temperature and pressure indicators, pressure and liquid level alarms, an ammonia vapor scrubber, cam-lock fill connections, vapor recovery and associated piping, excess flow valve, four strategically-located ammonia vapor detectors, and an emergency eyewash/shower station.  A wind sock is also provided for visual indication of wind direction in case of emergency evacuation.\n \nAmmonia solution is delivered by truck into the storage tank through a 2-inch cam-lock hose connection, located within the containment area.  The truck parks within a concrete area that is provided with a collection sump to contain spills from the delivery truck. The ammonia solution unloading to the storage tank is done through a quick fill connection.  A truck-mounted vapor recovery system is connected to the tank vapor recovery system during the unloading.  The storage tank is equipped with pressure and vacuum relief valves and the tank is maintained at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe redundant dispensing pump is placed into service when the main pump fails or is out of service for preventative maintenance.  The loading operator is provided with a readily accessible water supply to wash spills quickly.  All spills are collected and disposed of in accordance with the federal, state and local waste disposal requirements.  Flashing lights and audible alarms at the tank and in the main control room are activated when the ammonia gas monitors detect the gas concentration above 20 parts per million in the surrounding area.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe OCA is conducted in accordance with the latest RMP OCA guidance document that has been developed by the USEPA in conjunction with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

However, the maximum inventory is 15,000 gallons (75% fill capacity).  The entire volume of the solution is contained within the secondary containment system that has a maximum surface area for evaporation of 1,050 square feet.

The public receptor potentially affected within this distance includes an industrial facility which is located about 1,000 feet southeast of the ammonia storage area.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the spill of the ammonia solution as a result of the rupture of a two-inch diameter, 100 feet long flexible transfer hose during the bulk transferring of the solution from a tanker truck to the storage tanks.  The transfer pump is manually shut off within 30 seconds after the hose rupture.  The volume of spilled solution is estimated to be 66 gallons, which spills onto the paved ground and into the collection sump.\n\nThe regulatory default meteorological conditions used were: wind stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, ambient air temperature of 77F and a release temperature of 113F (maximum daily temperature at the nearest monitoring station), 50% a"
