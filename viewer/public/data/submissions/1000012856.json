After the plant operator or emergency coordinator arrives on the scene, the employees must jointly attempt to control the leak. Control of the leak is the first priority for the employees.

However, authorities at the City of Calhoun including the director of Public Works should be notified irrespective of the magnitude of the release.\r\n\r\nResponse Actions of Medium Release Scenario\r\nA determination that a release is medium rather than small is a judgment call made by the employee detecting the leak based on a visual evaluation of the situation.

If the employee is trained in the control of gas leaks he or she must wear a SCBA and wait upwind of the source for the plant operator and emergency coordinator to arrive at the scene.  The plant operator must evacuate the facility of all employees except those who will participate in leak control efforts.

The program includes a hazard assessment that evaluates both a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. This document serves a vital community right to know function by informing the public of potential risks associated with the releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide and described the CityA\u00bfs efforts to minimize such risks.\r\n\r\nREGULATORY BACKGROUND\r\nSection 112(r) of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act required certain facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued A\u00bfChemical Accident Prevention Provision,A\u00bf rules (contained in 40 CFR Part 68) to implement the 112(r) requirements. Under this rule, all covered facilities must implement a risk management program and file a risk management plan with the EPA by June 21, 1999. A covered facility would be one that uses, stores, manufactures, handles, or moves any of the 140 chemicals listed in 40 CFR Part 68 at quantities exceeding the threshold levels as provided in the regulations.\r\n\r\nFACILITY INFORMATION\r\nThe City of Calhoun water treatment plant (WTP) is a covered facility because of the usage and storage of chlorine . Chlorine is a regulated substances, and the threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds under the regulations. The chlorination facilities at the Calhoun WTP consist of eight 1-ton cylinders of chlorine (potential for a total of 16,000 pounds of chlorine). Since the storage quantities of chlori"

      "SummaryText": "ne exceeds the threshold, Calhoun WTP is a covered facility under the Risk Management Plan rules.\r\n\r\nThe City of Calhoun owns and operates an 18 million gallon per day (MGD) WTP in Calhoun, Georgia. The WTP provides water treatment to the local residential population and the numerous industries that are located in the City. Since Georgia is a federal OSHA state (i.e., Georgia has not been delegated OSHA responsibilities), state and local governments within Georgia are not subject to OSHA PSM standards, and therefore Calhoun WTP will not be a Program 3 facility. Thus, Calhoun WTP will be classified as a Program 2 facility.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis consists of two components: a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\nWorst-Case scenario has been defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance form a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an end point (DTE). The DTE is the distance a toxic vapor cloud will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur. In the case of Calhoun WTP, the worst-case scenario would involve the sudden release of the contents of a 1-ton cylinder of chlorine . RMP Program Guidance for Water Treatment Plants (RMP guidance) was used to estimate the DTE associated with a worst-case release. The calculations did not consider any passive mitigation systems. The guidance assumes that the contents of a 1-ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) are completely released over a 10-minute period with a corresponding release rate of 222 lb/min. The model assumes a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second and an atmospheric stability class F. Using this approach, it is predicted that a worst-case release of chlorine will result in a DTE of 3.0 miles, in a rural setting such as Calhoun, with an end point concentration of 0.0087 mg/L. The worst-case release D"

      "SummaryText": "TE encompasses the entire city limits of Calhoun. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe alternative release scenario for a covered process is one that is more likely to occur than a worst-case scenario. The RMP guidance suggests that the alternative release scenario should reach an endpoint off site, unless no such scenario exists. Based on an evaluation of the processes and procedures at the Calhoun WTP, it appears that a vapor release scenario is most likely. RMP guidance was used to estimate the DTE for a vapor release from a hole of 1/4 inch in diameter. Figure 3 presents a site map of the affected area from an alternative release scenario of chlorine. Calculations in the guidance assume a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec and an atmospheric stability class D. No active or passive mitigation systems were considered.\r\nFor a vapor release hole diameter of 1/4 inch, the release rate of chlorine is estimated to be 37 lbs/min with a DTE of 0.3 miles. \r\n\r\nOff-site Human Receptors\r\nPublic receptors include off-site residences; institutions (e.g., schools and hospitals); industrial, commercial, and office buildings; and parks or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time without restriction by the stationary source where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure as a result of an accidental release. \r\n\r\nWorst-case Scenario (Chlorine)\r\nLandview software was used to estimate the population affected from a worst-case release. From the affected area maps, it is clear that the entire city of Calhoun population will be affected. Therefore, a worst-case release will impact 7,135 persons, which is the population of Calhoun according to information in Landview.\r\n\r\nPublic receptors impacted by a worst-case release are as follows:\r\n City Hall\r\n Courthouse\r\n Churches (New Zion, First Methodist, First Baptist, First Presbyterian, St. Clements,  Belmont Baptist, and New Echota)\r\n Library\r\n High Schools (2), East S"

Green copper chloride may also form around the leak area.\r\n\r\nMoisture Formation: Small droplets of water may appear on the underside of leaking chlorine joint. It is recommended that chlorine lines be painted in bright yellow so that brown rush holes will be readily visible.\r\n\r\nAmmonia can be used to detect chlorine leaks.

Control of the leak should be the first priority for the employees. Authorities at the City of Calhoun including the director of Public Works will be notified of the release. Regulatory agencies will be notified following the discussion with the Authority personnel.\r\n\r\nResponse Actions of Large Release Scenario\r\nResponse actions for a large release are similar to a medium-scale release.  However, in this scenario, the accident is so major (such as a ruptured cylinder) that the bulk of the response efforts are tailored toward post-release mitigation, community evacuation and medical assistance.  Community evacuation if required should be conducted with the assistance of the local police and fire departments.  Any residents living in the zone of influence should be temporarily evacuated to an area of safety until such a time that the release gets controlled and the leaking gases are dispersed.  Traffic control on roads downwind of the release will be necessary to prevent persons from entering the gas release zone.\r\nImmediate medical assistance should be provided to facility employees and community members requiring assistance.  Providing medical assistance will require the support of ambulance service, paramedics, doctors, and local hospitals.\r\n\r\nRelease notification is of two types: verbal and written.
