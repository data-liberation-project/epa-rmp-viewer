The first release was chlorine that resulted in an injury which required medical attention.  The second release was methyl chloride which did not result in any injuries.\n\nEmergency Response\nRohm & Haas' Cincinnati facility is staffed with employees trained in emergency response 24 hours per day.  These employees receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\nThe local emergency responders in the community utilize computer programs like CAMEO and ALOHA for determining the likely extent of impact from a release.  Hence, the facilty chose to use these programs, in conjunction with guidance developed by USEPA, to determine the extent of the area predicted to be impacted under the various scenerios described above.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nRohm & Haas completes a thorough review of the potential impact of all chemicals for use at the facility prior to their use and on a continuous basis.  This also includes compounds that are not specifically addressed under the RMP regulation.  Rohm & Haas has reviewed the chemicals currently used on site as part of the compliance program involving the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, RCRA, Spill Prevention and Contigency Planning and Accidental Release Prevention.  Further, Rohm & Haas conducts Process Safety Management reviews at least every three years to ensure that each process that utilizes hazardous chemicals are thoroughly examined, including Hazardous and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Major Accident Prevention Program (MAPP) studies. \nRohm & Haas strives to continually improve employee training, chemical processes, control technology, inspections, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Rohm & Haas Cincinnati facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulation"

      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of the Rohm & Haas Cincinnati, Ohio facility to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) herein in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the potential of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Rohm & Haas employees, the community, and the environment.  This objective is met by continuing to utilize good operating and environmental, health, and safety procedures, participating in Responsible Care, providing appropriate training to all employees, and communicating and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers.\n\nFacility Description\nRohm & Haas' Cincinnati, Ohio facility operates primarily as a manufacturer of specialty chemicals.  Three chemicals - Chlorine, Methyl Chloride, and Aqueous Ammonia - are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the RMP requirements detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  All chemicals used at the facility, including those regulated by the RMP, are handled and stored using best management practices.\n\nConsequence Anaylsis\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program requires facilities to evaluate the impact of a release of the regulated dhemicals under well-defined conditions.  Two types of releases must be considered: a worst case scenerio must be examined as well as an alternative case scenerio.\nBy EPA regulations the worst case scenerio is defined as the catastrophic rupture of the vessel (or pipe) that causes the maximum quantity of the regulated chemical to be released.  The EPA specifies that all of the regulated chemical is released.  In addition, the worst case scenerio requires us to assume all process controls, safety devices, monitoring and detention systems fail to operate as designed.  Further, worst case scenerios do not consider possible caus"

      "SummaryText": "es or likelihood of the event.\nThe EPA also defines the conditions under which the evaporated material dissipates including conservative assumptions regarding the temperature, wind speed, and the tendency for mixing to occur in the atmosphere.  These EPA assumptions are such that the predicted concentration of the chemical represents an overestimate of what would actually occur.\nBy EPA regulations, the alternative release scenerio is an emergency planning release scenerio that must lead to an off-site impact based on a facility's use of the regulated chemical.  The emergency planning scenerio takes into account the facility's safety system's and response plans to minimize the release.\nThe alternative release scenerios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items that have been identified through HAZOP process and those associated with the chemical industry in general.  The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenerio.\nThe worst case consequence analysis indicated that using the EPA guidelines there could be off-site impact in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of chlorine from a railcar (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact the surrounding community.  The alternative release scenerios that were developed for each chemical indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by comparison to that predicted for the worst case scenerio.\nThe likelihood of either of these scenerios occuring is very small demonstrating Rohm & Haas' ability to handle chemicals in a safe manner.  In fact, the reduced impact areas of the alternative scenerios compared to the worst case scenerio is one measure of the effectiveness of Rohm & Haas' prevention and safety program"
