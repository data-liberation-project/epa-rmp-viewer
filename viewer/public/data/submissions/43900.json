As it is Dan Tudor & Sons\u00bf policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed during 1995 to the 1991 Uniform Building Code/Uniform Mechanical Code.  Personnel from Dan Tudor & Sons monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Dan Tudor & Sons\u00bf objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Dan Tudor & Sons and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nDan Tudor & Sons owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 33398 Woollomes Avenue.  Delano is the closest city to the Dan Tudor & Sons cold storage facility.  The rural plant was constructed during 1995 utilizing all new equipment at the time of construction. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for the Dan Tudor & Sons cold storage facility.  The refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, five compressors, two evaporative condensers, two high pressure receivers, and several flooded evaporators.  \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, durin"

The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest high pressure receiver is 15,390 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm). \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Dan Tudor & Sons to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\u00bf Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process is being compiled.\n\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n\u00bf Written operating procedures will be reviewed at least annually.\n\n\u00bf Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n\u00bf If employees are involved in operating the ammonia system, they will receive initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n\u00bf Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n\u00bf A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n\u00bf Pre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n\u00bf Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n\u00bf Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n\u00bf A wr"

The General Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDan Tudor & Sons has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDan Tudor & Sons has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Dan Tudor & Sons employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nDan Tudor & Sons relies on the expertise of qualified ammonia refrigeration contractors to regularly evaluate the need for any changes to the refrigeration equipment and to improve safety.  Currently, Dan Tudor & Sons does not have any changes planned to improve safety associated with the ammonia refrigeration system."
