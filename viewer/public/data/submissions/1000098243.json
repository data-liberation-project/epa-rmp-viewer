This plant is one of five water and wastewater plants operated by COAB. WWTP #1 and three other plants have quantities of regulated hazardous chemicals above the EPA threshold. COAB has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant. Only WWTP # 1 operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\n\n\n\n1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach (COAB), Florida, Water Treatment Plant (WTP) #1 Accidental Release Prevention Program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices. The prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\n2.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n\nCOAB has a management system in place which is led by the Deputy Public Works Director, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements. This program, along with other City-wide and plant-specific policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood of a hazardous chemical release at the plant.\n\n\n\n3.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 \n\nCOAB maintains policies, procedures, and systems as part of their prevention program. These are applied to WWTP #1 and each COAB treatment plant. The COAB program addresses each of the elements needed to implement the EPA RMP Program Level 2, which are also addressed in the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Being a public entity, COAB is subject to only the EPA RMP Level 2 Prevention Program. The policies and procedures are maintained in the COAB Document Management System (DMS).\n\n\n\n4.

The Plant includes chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution systems contained in a specially designed storage and process buildings. The boundaries of the systems subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems. These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&IDs) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\nCOAB WWTP# 1 employs five full-time employees engaged in wastewater treatment plant and field operations. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process.\n\n\n\n5.    REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substances on-site which exceed the 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities. The COAB chlorine and dechlorination processes were installed as part of the process of treating wastewater to meet strict FDEP discharge permit requirements.  The facility operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to two process control systems.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical. It is an irritant and it is corrosive. Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2. It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable. It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards. Chlorine is not a carcinogen.  \n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide is an EPA-and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Sulfur dioxide is a gas or liquid under pressure with the formula S02.  It is a dechlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 5 ppm OSHA PEL and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  S"

WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios, since chlorine has the lower PEL.  A sulfur dioxide release would have similar consequences.  \n\n\n\nThe first is a \"worst case release\". The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the ... shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  An atmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\" The EPA-selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l or  3 parts per million (ppm). The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\na.    WORST CASE \n\nAn atmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions. Results demonstrate a distance of ____ miles to the toxic endpoint. The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at ______ people.\n\nb.    ALTERNATIVE CASE \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the vacuum system connected to one of the one "

The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is _____.\n\n\n\n7.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nThe COAB Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the OSHA PSM Standard.  Since the facility is a public owned entity, it is subject to the EPA RMP Level 2 Prevention Program. The COAB Prevention Program has been in place and effectively used since the RMP rule was promulgated. It is part of the plants operating culture. There are two parts to the program. The first is the general overall City wide and WWTP #1 site program. The second is the chlorine-specific actions within the site program coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire Department.\n\n\n\na.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\n\n?    COAB has detailed process safety information on each of its operations.\n\n?    The DMS is integral to the management of change for all operations on-site control.\n\n?    Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.\n\n?    Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used.\n\n?    Routine and preventive maintenance are used for each piece of equipment, with the goal of maintaining mechanical integrity. \n\n?    Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure that lessons are learned from each event as well as the root causes of the incident.\n\n?

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nEmergency response procedures are described in the City of Atlantic Beach Emergency Response Plan.  Emergency phone numbers are posted at each facility, indicating who to call first and what to do if that person is unreachable. The Jacksonville Fire Department (911) is the first call listed.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plant operating procedures. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated based on the results of the drill.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is reviewed by the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida. Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including the fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach. Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach WTP # 1.\n\n\n\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine and sulfur dioxide spills (releases). The plan includes training of all chlorination and dechlorination-area operators. The primary response team is the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, plus the HazMat Team, who respond to severe leak situations. A Chlorine \"B\" Leak Repair Kit is maintained on site to aid in stopping leaks. Public notification is facilitated through the Atlantic Beach Police Department, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n\n\n\n10.    PERSONNEL \n\nPersonne"
