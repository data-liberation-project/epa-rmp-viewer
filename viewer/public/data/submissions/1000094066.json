      "SummaryText": "Turkey Hill Dairy operates an ice cream and cold drink manufacturing facility in Conestoga PA.\n\n\n\nLike most large food processing plants, we use anhydrous  ammonia in our refrigeration system.  Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\n\n\nTurkey Hill is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management Program to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\n\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management Program includes elements addressing:\n\n-Employee Participation:  We involve our employees at all appropriate points in the program.\n\n-Process Safety Information:  We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis:  We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n-Operating Procedures:  We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n-Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control):  We are establishing a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n-Training:  We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n-Management of Change:  Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limit"

      "SummaryText": "s.\n\n-Pre Startup Safety Review:  For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n\n-Contractors:  We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\n-Hot Work Permits:  We strictly control welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n\n-Emergency Response:  We coordinate our response to emergencies with the Lancaster Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n-Incident Investigation:  After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\n-Compliance Audits:  Approximately every three years, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\n-Trade Secrets:  OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets program in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is ever found.\n\nManagement System:  An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\n\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of this Risk Management Plan.  The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihood or \"risk\" of these incidents.\n\n\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario involves loss of the contents of a high-pressure receiver vessel over ten minutes.  As required, this scenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia is reached beyond the property line.\n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario involves lifting of a relief valve, a safety device provided on all vessels to prevent accidents such as the one specified as the \"worst-case.\"  The alternative scenario also has offsite impact.  We estimated that the release would end after sixty minutes, a plausible value consider"

      "SummaryText": "ing the controls we have in place to detect relief valve releases and considering the normal behavior of ammonia in vessels.\n\n\n\nWe used the EPA's RMP* Comp program to estimate hazard levels.  Please refer to the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to national security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.  There was one accidental release of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental Release History\n\nThere has not been any releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility coordinates response to emergencies with the Lancaster Emergency Planning Committee. The facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan to ensure an efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous substance release, fire, explosion or any other emergency. The plan includes First Aid procedures and Emergency Medical Treatment procedures, Evacuation plans, Notification/Communication.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThrough our Process Safety Management Program, we systematically look for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility.  We are currently working to resolve recommendations and issue raised in our latest Process Hazards Analysis, and we expect that we will make some changes to the plant and its operations."
