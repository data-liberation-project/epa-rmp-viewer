      "SummaryText": "Springs Hill Water Treatment Plant is located in Guadalupe County, Texas, in a rural community, primarily agricultural and rural residential.  The Springs Hill Water Treatment Plant is located near the City of Seguin, Texas. The water treatment plant is located along the banks of the Guadalupe River, and uses chlorine gas as the primary water disinfectant. The entire supply on hand consists of a maximum of two (2), one-ton containers.\nVacuum feed/injection system is used to prevent leaks in the system.  A chlorine leak detector is installed with an audible alarm system to alert personnel of chlorine leaks. There are SCBA units on-site for chlorine emergencies. The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times per day by an on-site operator and monitoring daily on the weekends. Preventive maintenance is performed regularly.  A hazard assessment has been conducted and documented in accordance with 40 CFR 68.20 -68.42 and a prevention program has been implemented to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.48 - 68.60. There have been no accidental chlorine gas releases within the past five years."
