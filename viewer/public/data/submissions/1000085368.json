This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Lehigh County LEPC, Local Emergency Planning Committee, for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, RMP Plan on file at the facility.

To meet these necessary requirements Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, has not experienced any accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in on site or off site impacts, or that required reporting.  \n\n \n\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nAldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, utilizes a unified approach in handling emergencies that may arise in regard to the ammonia refrigeration system.  All OSHA and EPA guidelines are adhered to and the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been consulted and a comprehensive action plan developed.  Aldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, facility does not play an active role in the emergency response, however, personnel have been trained to cooperate with local authorities who are responding to an incident.  The emergency action plan is reviewed annually and all parties are to be informed of any facility changes.\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nAldi, Inc., Center Valley, PA, currently has no changes planned for the ammonia refrigeration process at this time.   However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system.
