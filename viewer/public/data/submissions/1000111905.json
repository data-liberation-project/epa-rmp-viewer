Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies We at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This is evidenced through our Core Values found in the Brenntag Cornerstone. The six (6) elements or core values of Brenntag Cornerstone are: SAFETY FIRST, LEADERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY, EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT AND OWNERSHIP, COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WORLD CLASS VALUE CREATION. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation,\noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with GREENSBORO FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution. We have 2 regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonium Hydroxide (Ammonia aqueous solution) and Ethylenediamine. The RMP regulated substance is packaged elsewhere and is simply stored and warehoused at our Greensboro facility for distribution.\n\n3.To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Federal, State, and Local regulations. Brenntag is also ISO 9000-2001 certified. The fol"
