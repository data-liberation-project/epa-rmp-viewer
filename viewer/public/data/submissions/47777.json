However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Compliance Director, Safety Manager, and Safety Engineer.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\r\n     \r\n     The Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n     \r\n     The PHA team recommendations are reviewed with plant management for evaluation and resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\r\n     \r\n     To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the ori"

Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities. \r\n  \r\n     The overall emergency response program for the Plant is coordinated with the Marshall County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Marshall County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) along with offsite responders who would be called to support emergency response efforts if required. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, the ISP Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC, Marshall County OEM, and emergency response organizations, and the plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \r\n\r\n1.8   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n     \r\n     ISP's Calvert City Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting suggestions from the worker"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Calvert City Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care? to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Calvert City Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at ISP's Calvert City Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at the Calvert City Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n1.1\t\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\n     The ISP Calvert City Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Plant evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, responds based on our capabilities, skills and training, and if necessary, contacts the local Mutual Aid Association, Calvert Industrial Mutual Aid Program (CIMAP), to assist in controlling a"

Some of these feed materials and products are toxic or flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in our process units above the specified EPA threshold quantity.  In total, we have 11 processes that are covered by the RMP rule. The following are the RMP substances we handle in covered processes:  Acetylene1, Propane, Cyclohexylamine, Vinyl Methyl Ether, Ammonia, Ethylamine, and 2-Methylpropene.\r\n\r\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis\r\n\t\r\n     This Information is no longer required to be submitted in the executive summary.\r\n     \r\n\r\n1.4  \tAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n     The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Calvert City Plant.  Because processes at the Plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for chemical manufacturing facilities, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPA?s Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n1.4.1\tEmployee Participation\r\n     \r\n     ISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams. Employees have access to all information created as part of the site accident prevention program.

In addition, the Calvert City Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\n1.4.2\tProcess Safety Information\r\n     \r\n     The Calvert City Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \r\n     \r\n     Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating manuals.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n     \r\n     The Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in c"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained. \r\n\r\n1.4.4\tOperating Procedures\r\n     \r\n     The Calvert City Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n     \r\n1.4.5\tTraining\r\n\r\n     To complement the written procedures for process operations, ISP has implemented a company training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training on site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, and (3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  The Plant maintains SWPP 19, Contractor Safety, which specifically addresses contractor safe work practices and is reviewed for accuracy and updates every 3 years.  In addition, the Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n     \r\n1.4.7\tPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\n     \r\n     ISP conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.
