The recirculation pump pulls caustic solution from the storage tank and circulates it through the 3 stages, allowing the vapor-laden gases to be absorbed into the caustic and discharging vapor-free air through the stack.  Other safeguards in the system to prevent an accidental release are the use of a chlorine vapor detector, exhaust fans and emergency alarms.\n\nOff Site Consequence Analysis\nEach hazard assessment consisted of worst-case and alternative scenarios in order to evaluate the potential impacts of accidental releases of chlorine on the public health and environment. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \nKuwahee uses chlorine in one (1) ton cylinders; therefore the worst-case scenario was based on the assumption that approximately 2000 pounds of chlorine would be released. All calculations for air dispersion modeling was performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using Landviewer 2000.  The worst-case scenario was evaluated based upon release duration of 10 minutes and a release rate of 110 pounds/minute.  Air dispersion modeling resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles.  The maps with overlays depicting this scenario are shown in the Offsite Impact Analysis section of the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \nKUB\u00bfs process hazard analysis (PHA) indicated a chlorine release would most likely occur due to a failure in the chlorination system piping, therefore modeling for the alternative scenario was based on this assumption. All calculations for the air dispersion modeling were performed with RMP Comp Version 1.06 and results were mapped by using Landviewer 2000.  The maps with overlays depicting this scenario are shown in the Offsite Impact Analysis section of the plan. \n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a one-ton cylinder, operating at a rate of 0.777 lb/min (after scrubbing) over a 10"

The chlorine leak rate is calculated using an opening with an area of 0.783 (area of the vacuum regulator connection). It was assumed that the pressure of the cylinder was 125 psi, which corresponds to a temperature of 90 degrees F. The cylinder is contained within a building with a scrubber (99.99% chlorine removal). Other assumptions are listed on the printout for the release scenario.\n \nFive Year Accident History\nIn addition to the off-site consequence analysis, a five (5) year accident history was compiled.  In the past five years there have been no accidents related to chlorine releases at Kuwahee. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nKUB\u00bfs Emergency Response Program is based upon the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs \u00bfPamphlet 64 - Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities\u00bf and is designed to address the specific emergency needs associated with a chlorine leak. Even though Kuwahee has active mitigation systems to minimize the likelihood of a release, KUB has a comprehensive emergency response plan that is complete, up-to-date and supplemented with emergency response training and drills for employees. KUB\u00bfs Plan has been submitted to and reviewed by the City of Knoxville Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC). In the event of an off-site release, the Plan prepares KUB and the Community for a response to and mitigation of accidental chlorine releases in order to limit the severity of such releases and their impact on both public health and environment.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nKUB has recently implemented  a work management system called the Mincom Information Management System (MIMS).  Use of this system will help assure that all chlorine feed systems, including emergency monitoring systems, are properly maintained and operated.  Preventive maintenance work orders are generated automatically and routed to the designated crew.  In a"

KUB\u00bfs RMP involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and best management practices. All applicable regulations as required by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) Chemical Accident Prevention \u00bf 40 CFR Part 68 are addressed in this Plan.\n\nFacility Information & Regulated Substances\nThe Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant is an advanced wastewater treatment facility that includes primary sedimentation, a combined secondary and nitrification system, anaerobic sludge digestion, and high pressure filter press dewatering. The average daily dry weather design flow of the facility is 40 million gallons (MGD) per day. The maximum chlorine storage capacity at this facility is 36,000 pounds.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe prevention program is based upon the following key elements:\n\u00b7High level training for operators,\n\u00b7Effective preventive maintenance system,\n\u00b7Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment,\n\u00b7Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators,\n\u00b7Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures, and\n\u00b7Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nActive Mitigation Systems/Control Measures\nThe chlorine scrubber system is a once-through, three-stage absorption system designed to contain and safely evacuate a major chlorine leak while maintaining toxic vapor emissions below the Uniform Fire Code requirement of 1/2 the IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value at all times.  To accomplish this, the scrubber removes >99.99% of the toxic vapor in the air while maintaining a negative pressure in the chlorine storage room.
