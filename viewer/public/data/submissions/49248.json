      "SummaryText": "1.  Facility Policy:  The City of Plattsburg is committed to the prevention of any accidental chlorine release.  If an accidental release occurs the facility is prepared to work with the Clinton County Emergency Manager, local fire departments and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity of this plant is the treatment and distribution of drinking water.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The City abides by all applicable State of Missouri chlorine regulations and follows training and operating procedures to guard against accidental chlorine release.  If a release should occur, the City will notify all applicable response agencies to minimize harm to the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History:  There have not been any accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years that have caused any deaths,  injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan:  The faciltiy has a written Emergency Response Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of chlorine occurs at the facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and to call 911 and the applicable emergency response phone numbers.\n\n6.  Planned Change to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the faciltiy.  Periodic evaluations are performed to ascess the condition of the plant.  Chlorine safety training occurs on a regular basis.  The facility will install an automatic shut off valve on the chlorine system to improve safety.  There are no other major safety recommendations regarding the use and storage of chlorine at this facility."
