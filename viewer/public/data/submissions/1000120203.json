Las Flores Canyon Treating Plant\nRisk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Santa Ynez Unit (SYU) Las Flores Canyon Treating Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \n\nThe Santa Ynez Unit - Las Flores Canyon Treating Plant, located about 17 miles west of Santa Barbara, California, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic. Transportation of regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline and truck.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\n\nThis facility is located in a vegetated canyon with undeveloped rural land extending beyond the canyon to the north, east and west.  A highway borders the canyon approximately 1.5 miles to the south.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario from the Sable LFC facility is a rupture of the ammonia storage vessel. This is the largest ammonia vessel. The maximum liquid quantity that may be contained within the vessel is approximately 50,000 pounds. The worst"

The distance to the toxic endpoint has been calculated using EPA\u0092s RMP Comp analysis program as 2.6 miles.? \n\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario is a failure of the largest propane storage vessel at maximum capacity.? This could result in the release of 320,000 pounds of propane.? The worst-case scenario assumes ignition of the flammable cloud, and subsequent explosion.? The distance to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch has been calculated using EPA\u0092s RMP Comp as 0.6 miles.?? \n\nThe worst case for flammable regulated substances and the worst case for regulated toxic substances, was selected considering scenarios based on the following factors if such a scenario would result in a greater distance to an endpoint defined in \u00a7 68.22(a) beyond the stationary source boundary than the scenario provided under paragraph (b) of this section:? \n?(1) Smaller quantities handled at higher process temperature or pressure; and? \n?(2) Proximity to the boundary of the stationary source.?    \nRefer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 of this plan.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at this facility.  Processes at this facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) contact at this facility is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.  For specific process areas, this facility has documented safety-related operating limits for process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level) in the operating procedures.  This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\n\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a PHA delta revalidation process, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.  Implementation of the resolutions is prioritized for accomplishment based on relative risk.  Resolution plans are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure the process controls and/or hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, this facility updates and revalidates the process hazard analysis at least every 5 years.  The results of these updates are also documented and retained.  Similarly, the team's findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution, and the final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThis facility maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations (e.g., startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown) and provide guidance on how to respond to upper/lower limit exceedances for speci"

Revisions to procedures are made through the Management of Change (MOC) process.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Sable Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) provides the framework to ensure operators and other employees achieve minimum required competencies to safely perform their work.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified and allowed to work independently.  In addition, personnel who operate process equipment receive refresher training at least every 3 years on the applicable procedures to help ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented.\n\nContractors\n\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform Las Flores Canyon facility personnel of any hazar"
