Using EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate formaldehyde would travel 0.20 miles before the concentration dispersed to a level considered by EPA to be non-hazardous. Within these areas, a population of 71 would potentially be affected, including residences and commercial and industrial facilities.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - Flammable (ID#2) - Analysis of our systems indicate that the more likely flammable scenario would be the release of 11,000 pounds of dimethylamine from a two-inch hole in a tank, discharging into an uncontained area. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate the evaporated dimethylamine would explode and the distance to a 1 psi over pressure would be approximately 0.07 miles. Within these areas, a population of 9 would potentially be affected, including residences and commercial and industrial facilities. \n\nAccident history: In the past five years, this facility has had no incidents with RMP regulated materials causing an offsite consequence. We have had one incident with onsite consequences that meet RMP reporting requirements. On August 26, 1996, heat from a welding operation ignited what we believe was methylamine vapors in a process water tank, rupturing the vessel and injuring a contract employee. Following the incident, hot work procedures and the related training programs for both employees and contractors were reviewed and emphasized. We have experienced occasions when citizens have reported objectionable odors coming from the plant."

While directed at quality, the training and documentation requirements of ISO standards are quite similar to those for OSHA and EPA under Process Safety Management and Risk Management.\n\nIn addition to the audits required by all three of these guidelines, we are regularly visited, inspected and/or audited by regulatory agencies. \n\nEmergency Response: Our operators are trained to identify unusual occurrences. In the event of an incident on the plant site, our Emergency Response Plan tells us to take the following actions:\n\tA public address system will notify all employees that an event has occurred. Monitors include automatic detectors and visual inspection by our operators.\n\tOperators will shut down transfer systems as they evacuate the operating portions of our plant\n\tAll employees will shelter in place in an office area on the site\n\tDesignated employees will call for fire and emergency services via 911\n\tWe will summon our emergency response contractors\n\tWe will advise emergency responders of the known hazards and follow their guidance\n\nTraining and preparation: Certainly all of us want to do everything we can to protect the health and well being or our employees and our community.

Regardless, we have an obligation to determine the source(s) of these odors and to take actions to prevent a recurrence. \n\nThe goal at Vinings is to produce quality products and to produce them safely. We have systems in place to prevent accidents, to safeguard our employees, our community and our environment. Following is a partial listing of our Layers of Protection that we employ in our everyday activities.\n\nDesign: All of our valve systems are designed to fail-safe. This means that in the event of the loss of electrical or air power, valves will return - open or closed as necessary - to the safe position. We have concrete dikes (secondary containment) to catch spilled materials.\n\nOn a regular schedule, we are required to complete a comprehensive review of the hazards and operability of our entire production system. If we find a valve, pipe, tank or pump that might fail and allow a release or an incident, we will correct it.  \n\nMaintenance: We have a documented maintenance program in place. Our operators will recheck equipment before operating it, after maintenance has been performed on it. Using a combination of safety and quality programs, all of our instruments are calibrated and our storage and transfer systems are tested on a regular basis.\n\nSafe Operations: Our employees are essential to the safe operation of our plant. Their training, their experience, their observations and their knowledge of how to respond to situations is the basis of safe operations. These people apply their knowledge and training in their everyday actions. All activities in Plant II - from unloading railcars to filling trucks and railcars with finished products - are restricted to trained, designated employees.\n\nThe equipment and systems that contain raw materials are closed; that is, the materials are contained in equipment that is designed to prevent any materials from reaching the atmosphere or environment.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Vinings Industries, Inc.\nPlant: Marietta (West Oak), GA\n\nVinings Industries is a chemical manufacturing company based in Atlanta, GA. Specialty chemicals are produced for several diverse industries including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment and agricultural pest control. \n\nThe West Oak facility manufactures products for paper, pigment mining, water treatment and agricultural markets. Plant II, the portion of the plant covered by Risk Management, makes several dithiocarbamate products that are sold to other chemical companies for use in paper manufacturing, pigment mining, agricultural pest control, and water treatment applications. The West Oak plant consists of two operating portions: one portion is covered by OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP, the other is not. OSHA regulations (Process Safety Management) for several years have required that multiple Layers of Protection be included during design, before startup and to continue through operations and training of all employees. These Layers of Protection today are part of our Risk Management Programs.\n\nThe West Oak plant uses six materials that are covered under Risk Management:  chlorine, ethylenediamine, carbon disulfide, formaldehyde, methylamine and dimethylamine. EPA lists chlorine, carbon disulfide, ethylenediamine, and formaldehyde as Toxics; methylamine and dimethylamine are listed as flammables. Chlorine is used at West Oak in the pretreatment of waste water prior to a permitted discharge to the Cobb County system. The other materials are used in the production of several different dithiocarbamate products.\n\nChlorine:\nYellow-green gas with a bleach-like odor\nThe vapor is heavier than air\nExposure can be irritating to the eyes and throat\nContact with the skin can cause dermatitis or blistering\nInhalation can cause the excessive production of mucus and liquid in the lungs\nProlonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nCarbon disulfi"

      "SummaryText": "cancer\nProlonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nAs part of Vinings' stewardship and safety programs, we recognize that the amines are toxic and that formaldehyde and carbon disulfide are flammable. The design of storage and handling systems take both hazards of each material into consideration. All raw materials handling, from rail car unloading, through storage, reaction, storage and loading of finished product into shipping containers, is closed during normal operating conditions. Venting, when required, is routed through scrubbers designed to minimize emissions to the atmosphere. \n\nChlorine is added directly to waste water to destroy residual dithiocarbamates in the waste water treatment system. It is used separately from raw materials in a building with sensors designed to detect any loss of material.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis: \nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical (ID#3) -  Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario (Toxic) to be the sudden and complete release of three full cylinders (6,000 pounds) of chlorine hooked to a common header. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate chlorine would travel approximately 2.3 miles. This distance is based on the assumption of urban terrain. Within the larger affected area, a population of 23,000 would potentially be affected, including residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas and commercial and industrial facilities.\n \nWorst Case Scenario - Flammable (ID#2)- Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario (Flammable) to be a tank leak discharging 36,000 pounds of methylamine into an uncontained area. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate the evaporated methylamine would explode and the distance to a 1 psi over pressure would be approximately 0.25 miles. Within these areas, a population of 111 would potentially be affected, including residences and commercial and industrial facilities. \n\nAlternative Scenarios:  While the alternative scenarios are still unlikely"
