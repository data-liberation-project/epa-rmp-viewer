The Fort Hall Fire Department will respond to a fire emergency at the plant. The Pocatello Fire Department is the designated backup for Fort Hall. The Regional Response HAZMAT Team No. 5 is a division of the Pocatello Fire Department and is a support unit for the State of Idaho Emergency Response Commission. Power County Sheriff's Department has a mutual-aid agreement with the Bannock County Sheriff's Department. The Idaho State Police would respond to any incident involving the state highways near the plant, Highway 30 and I-86.\nf)   Planned changes to improve safety:\n    1) The Don Plant is continually evaluating the safety of workers and has been involved in behavioral safety, referred to as C.A.R.E. (Commit, Assess, Resolve, Encourage), which was established in 2007 as a behavioral based safety assessment program. The program is currently utilized by all employees.   \n     2) All Don Plant employees have been trained in basic computer skills. This allows them to be able to reference all plant safety procedures and policies to ensure that they are understood and used on a daily basis.  All jobs at our facility have been reviewed and JSAs (Job Safety Analysis) have been written.  These documents covering RMP are reviewed and recertified annually. \n    3) Internal assessments are conducted to evaluate all PSM programs and make corrections and improvements as necessary. \n    4) Safety t"

Simplot Company, Don Plant, Don Siding, Idaho, is committed to being a responsible community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and ongoing. Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a significant accidental release to the air from the plant. The Pocatello and Fort Hall Fire Departments and local emergency agencies receive the annual Sara Title III reports on materials manufactured, stored, and handled at the Don Plant.  It is Simplot's policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory agencies.\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances manufactured, processed, stored, or handled:\n   1) The J.R. Simplot Company, Don Plant facility manufactures fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and animal feed supplements. The Don Plant unloads, stores, and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the threshold limits requiring a RMP.\nc)  The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n   1) Employees are trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials in the Plant. Each employee receives initial training, and refresher training every three years for PSM areas in the plant, or appropriate refresher training related to the job when hired or when re-assigned. Anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in several locations in the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.\n   2) In addition to training, the following precautions are taken:\n         A) Pipes and equipment handling anhydrous ammonia have pressure relief valves.\n         B) Vehicle access is restricted by per"
