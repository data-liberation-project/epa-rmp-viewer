Inergy acquired the North Coles Levee Fractionator on October 1, 2003, and is added a new butane isomerization (butamer) unit to the facility in 2008.  The facility is owned and operated by Crestwppd Midstream Partners, LLC.  Facility operations are covered by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (Cal OSHA) regulations in Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), ?5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM).  The facility is also subject to the Office of Emergency Service's regulations in Title 19 CCR,  ?2735, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  This is a Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) and CalARP Program Level 3 process for flammables.\n\n\n\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Aqueous Ammonia System at the North Coles Levee Facility in July 2005.  The Aqueous Ammonia System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations ?2755, CalARP Program.  This is a CalARP Level 2 process.  The prevention program described below has been implemented.\n\n\n\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System at the North Coles Levee Facility in 2008.  The Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2755 CalARP Program.  This is a Cal ARP Level 2 process.  The prevention program described below has been implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe facility processes, stores, and transfers natural gas, natural gasoline, propane, and butane.  There are 32 tanks with capacities ranging from 4,000 to 44,000 gallons, two tanks with a capacity of 1.3 million gallons, two tanks with a capacity of 1.7 million, one tank with a capacity of 5 million gallons, and one 15 m"

      "SummaryText": "illion gallon storage tank. The worst-case flammable scenario is based upon a release of 15 million gallons of butane.\n\n\n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator operates 24 hours per day receiving natural gas from surrounding production fields.  Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are recovered from the natural gas through a refrigeration process.  The remaining natural gas is sold to Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulated utility companies for home use.  NGL's are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses.  This facility has the ability to remove hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming liquid deliveries.  In the summer, the facility receives and stores liquid propane to be used as winter fuel in refrigerated storage tanks.\n\n\n\nDuring 2008, Crestwood (as Inergy) started construction of a new butane isomerization (butamer) unit at the North Coles Levee Facility, and an updated RMP was submitted in January of 2009. The butamer converts normal butane (n-butane) into iso-butane. The conversion of n-butane to iso-butane is accomplished catalytically in the presence of hydrogen.  This submittal is the 5-year resubmission of the January 2009 plan.\n\n\n\nCrestwood currently operates two cogeneration units, both of which utilize a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System and oxidation catalyst to reduce oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas.  The system utilizes aqueous ammonia, which is mixed in dilution air in a vaporizer tower, vaporized, and directed to the reactor where it is injected upstream of the catalyst bed.  \n\n\n\nCrestwood also utilizes a refrigeration system for the treatment and/or storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids, which contains approximately 1150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.   \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the requirements of Title 40 "

The passive mitigation considered for this analysis includes enclosures and berms.  This scenario is based upon the RMP Comp Version 1.07 software.\n\n\n\nThe flammables worst-case scenario used butane as the modeled substance.  The worst-case release of 73,000,000 pounds of butane indicates a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 3.36 miles.

The alternate release scenario of 60 pounds of anhydrous ammonia indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  There were no allowances for passive mitigation in the worst-case scenario distance model.  This scenario is based upon RMP Comp Version 1.07 software.\n\n\n\nThe second toxic alternate release scenario used aqueous ammonia as the modeled substance.  The alternate release scenario of 7,400 pounds of aqueous ammonia at a release rate of 148 lbs/min indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.3 miles.  This distance does not impact any public receptors.  The allowance used for passive mitigation was a drain located in close proximity to the aqueous ammonia system.  This scenario is based upon the RMP Comp Version 1.07 software.\n\n\n\nThe flammables alternate release scenario used butane as the modeled substance.

This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements already in place.  Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installation, is an investment in good business practices.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
