(Clariant) facility above the threshold quantity of 1000 lbs. according to 40 CRF 68.130.\n\nClariant uses fluorine in the manufacture of 5-Fluorouracil.  The fluorine is delivered to and stored at the facility in tube trailers.  Each tube contains 225 lbs. of fluorine (diluted with 80% nitrogen).  Each trailer contains 8 tubes.  There is a maximum of 2 tube trailers on site any given time.  Therefore, the maximum inventory of fluorine on site at any given time is 3600 lbs.  Though the tubes may contain pressures of up to 2200 psig, the unloading system immediately regulates the pressure to approximately 45 psig for delivery to the reactor system.  The system is configured with an excess flow valves and shut-off valves to prevent catastrophic failure and release of fluorine. \n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nClariant LMS (Puerto Rico) Inc. is in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  The key prevention program is procedural/managerial.  An extensive Hazard and Operability study and two subsequent revalidations have been conducted on the fluorine / fluorination reaction system.  The site has a strong maintenance program including calibrations, preventative maintenance inspections, etc.  The operators in the facility are experienced and well-trained.  Specific written procedures are used to ensure safety during operation of the process.  The site also maintains an Emergency Response procedure that provides measures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the unlikely event of a release of hazardous material.  The site is active in self-evaluation of its performance to ensure compliance with all safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\nNo accidents as defined by 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at the facility in the past five years.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety inclu"
