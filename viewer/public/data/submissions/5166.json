The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough TNI's ERP is specifically written for the TNI facility the plan is also part of the parish wide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nTNI is striving on a daily basis to try and make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  TNI literally has safety and or environmental training going on almost daily, every employee and contractor will attend several safety and/or environmental training meeting annually. TNI and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."

      "SummaryText": ".  The urea plant takes some of the ammonia and the carbon dioxide (by-product) from the ammonia plants.  The ammonia and carbon dioxide is then mixed together at approximately 3650F and 2050 psi for approximately 1 hour to form urea. \n\nThe processes of making ammonia and urea require the use of cooling water that uses chlorine for purification purposes.  TNI stores approximately 10,000 pounds of chlorine within each covered process.\n\nTNI's worst -case release scenario is a 30,000-ton ammonia storage tank. The selection of the ammonia storage tank for the worst-case release was determined by the regulatory definition of the worst-case release. As defined by the Risk Management Plan regulations, when the entire 30,000 tons of ammonia in 10 minutes is released, produces a scenario with a 3.3-mile distance to the endpoint.  This was determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nTNI's alternative scenarios include the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine and 80 tons of ammonia. The selection of the alternative scenarios was based on researching information sources for release data.  The EPA Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) database and publications from the AIChE Ammonia Safety Symposia were reviewed.  Informal interviews with ammonia and urea plant operators, supervisors, engineers and managers were conducted in each plant.\n\nTNI uses chlorine in 2,000 pound cylinders for water treatment. The complete failure of one of these cylinders under the regulatory defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.49 mile distance to the endpoint.  TNI ships ammonia in railcars. By regulation the railcar can not hold more than 80 tons of ammonia. A complete failure of an 80-ton railcar under the regulatory defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.90-mile distance to the endpoint. The distances to the endpoint for the alternate scenarios were also determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nAs previously di"

Currently, TNI has two ammonia plants and one urea plant. In the production of ammonia, TNI uses natural gas, air, and water as feedstocks.  The feedstocks are heated to a point that they are broken down into nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. This is in the gas state.  The carbon dioxide is then removed form the gas stream as a by-product, and only nitrogen and hydrogen remain in the gas stream.  The hydrogen and nitrogen is then bonded together to form ammonia (NH3). The ammonia is then cooled to form a liquid at -280F. The ammonia is sent to two 30,0000 ton storage tanks and the urea plant"
