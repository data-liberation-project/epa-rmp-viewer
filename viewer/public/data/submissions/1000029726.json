American Water Enterprises - EMC and the City are committed to the implementation of safe procedures for chlorine that is stored and utilized at the Mississippi River Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) in order to protect employees and the community in the event of an accidental release.  \r\nThe Mississippi River WWTF stores chlorine in one ton cylinders and the maximum quantity on-site for the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulated substance is 8,000 pounds. Chlorine is utilized in disinfection of the WWTF effluent discharged to the Mississippi River as required by the U.S. EPA.       \r\nThe Mississippi River WWTF has an extensive Risk Management Plan that follows OHSA and U.S. EPA guidelines. Automatic chlorine shut-off valves to prevent the accidental release of chlorine in reportable amounts were installed in 2006. The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is incorporated into the RMP to ensure procedures are in place to provide for the safety of the employees and general public, as well as the environment and property. The ERP applies to all employees, contractors and visitors. All employees are required to be informed of the necessary actions taken in the case of a chlorine emergency:\r\n\u00bf\tNew employees are briefed in the ERP on the first day of active employment.\r\n\u00bf\tAll employees receive training in emergency actions with an annual review of the ERP.\r\n\u00bf\tAll Emergency Response Team members are trained in accordance with OSHA 1910.120 (q) for Emergency Responders and NFPA Standards for SCBA Training.\r\n\u00bf\tAll First Aid providers are trained and certified by the American Red Cross.\r\n\u00bf\tAll employees are trained in the use of fire extinguishers.\r\nThe Mississippi River WWTF has had no accidental release of chlorine in reportable amounts within the last thirty years."
