The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute guidelines, Compressed Gas Association guidelines, manufacturer specifications, best management practices, and state law.  The Reid/Henderson/Green Stations are required to comply with the most stringent EPA RMP and OSHA prevention programs.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program: In the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, it is BREC's policy for the operator to evacuate the immediate area.  If any release is likely to impact off site, the local emergency services will be notified. BREC has an in-house rescue team (ERT) whose members are trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician level as defined by 29 CFR 1910.120. The ERT members are trained to use self-contained breathing equipment and Level A suits and have taken OSHA worker right-to-know training. Contract response teams are available to respond to releases and clean-up beyond the capabilities, level of expertise or availability of the in-house emergency rescue team."

      "SummaryText": "training, management of change, process safety information, etc., for operations involving regulated substances;\r\n\r\n    An emergency response program to mitigate any accidental releases that occur; and\r\n\r\n     An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management program.\r\n\r\nA description of the regulated substances handled:  The Reid/Henderson/Green Stations are electric power generation stations. Chlorine (the threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds; the site has 8,000 pounds) is the only RMP regulated substance, at this facility, above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA\r\n\r\nThis facility uses chlorine to treat river water for plant usage (e.g. cooling water) in quantities requiring an RMP (under present EPA regulation).  This process is similar to the chlorination process used in drinking water supplies.  Chlorine is a dense, nonflammable greenish-yellow gas with a bleach-like odor.  It is corrosive and severely irritating to all tissue.  The chlorine reduces bacterial and algal growth. The water treatment systems consist of a one ton chlorine container and associated piping, valves, and chlorine feed equipment that dissolves chlorine into the circulated water. \r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with requirements for chlorine use, and it is Big Rivers Electric Corporation's procedure to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Big Rivers Electric Corporations procedure to make all proper notifications to emergency management.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  The Reid/Henderson/Green Stations have not had an accident in the past five years involving chlorine that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention s"

The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\r\n\r\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\r\n\r\n     A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of worst-case and alternative accidental release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances;\r\n\r\n     A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance,"
