All operators associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the system.\n\n\n\nThe storage tank and piping system at this facility has been designed and constructed using good engineering practices and to conform to industry standards. The system includes ammonia detection devices near the storage tank, an excess-flow emergency shutdown valve located on the main line outside the building and 2 sets of safety relief valves to avert serious system overpressure. A water curtain for ammonia vapor suppression is in place surrounding the ammonia storage tank. A regular inspection of the storage tank, piping system, and mitigation equipment ensures ongoing system integrity.\n\n\n\n4) Five Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years, the facility has had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5) Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Bercen will initiate an evacuation of the facility and notify the proper authorities, including the Livingston Parish Fire District #5 and the Livingston Parish - Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The LEPC is involved in the overall Bercen emergency planning efforts. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).\n\n\n\n6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility plans to implement safety improvements driven by the most recent PHA and compliance audit. These changes include additional instrumentation, improvements in mechanical integrity procedures, revisions to the emergency response plan, and additional employee training.\n\n"
