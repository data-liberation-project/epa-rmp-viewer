      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - The Milwaukee brewery falls under the Risk Management regulation because the quantity of refrigerant (anhydrous ammonia) in the refrigeration system exceeds the threshold quantity.  In order to maintain a safe working environment, the brewery has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  The Milwaukee Brewery has implemented a process safety management program, which enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  The brewery also maintains a Hazardous Materials Response Team complete with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment.  The team is trained to quickly and effectively respond to a release of hazardous material.  The facility also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation. \n\nA worst-case release scenario was modeled to determine the greatest impact a release of ammonia from the facility could reasonably cause.  This unlikely scenario is based on a complete and total release of ammonia from the vessel whose release would extend furthest off-site.  The worst-case release of ammonia from this vessel is a complete loss of 11,500 pounds of ammonia in a ten-minute period.  Computer modeling was used to reasonably evaluate the impacts from such a release.  The modeling indicates that impacts from the worst case release would impact public receptors beyond the property boundaries.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also modeled using computer software to reasonably evaluate the impacts from a release.  The alternative release scenario is based on an operator error in which an improper line up of valves caused an overflow of 760 lbs. of liquid ammonia through a safety relief valve to the rooftop.  The alternative release scenari"

      "SummaryText": "o is a scenario, which is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  The modeling indicates that impacts from the alternative release scenario would impact public receptors beyond the property boundaries.\n\nIn the previous five years, the Miller facility has not had any accidental releases, which resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage from the ammonia process.\n\nThe Miller facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the Miller facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance related issues), pre-start-up-review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work (welding) permits, and contractor safety.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program consists of the following core elements; 24 hour monitoring by ammonia refrigeration specialists, hazard communication training for all employees on anhydrous ammonia, an emergency response plan, a hazardous material response team, ammonia response drawings, and coordination with local authorities and emergency response units.  \n\nThe emergency response plan at the Miller facility contains information and procedures relative to initial response, evacuation, fire response, chemical releases, severe weather, bomb threats, facility specific information (site maps/drawings, security, communication system, emergency organization), emergency/spill prevention, post emergency procedures, training summary, and administrative management of change.  \n\nThe emergency response plan for the facility has been submitted to the Milwaukee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
