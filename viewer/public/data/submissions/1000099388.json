      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nCoastal Energy Corporation (CEC) has been in business for over 40 years.  The Willow Springs facility currently stores 3.13 million gallons of asphalt and fuel oil in the most advanced containment system available today. Situated on 90 acres of agricultural property, with a transportation rail spur, CEC is a well-managed business with an outstanding safety record. Operations expanded in March 2017 to include a propane system. \n\n\n\nCEC stores more than the threshold quantity of propane (10,000 pounds) as part of their bulk plant operations. Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.150. The propane storage at the facility is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary. The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\n\nA?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCEC has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Action Plan. This plan has been endorsed by CEC staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. CEC has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of a propane release. All personnel involved in handling propane are trained with regard to safety and accident prevention.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Coastal Energy Corporation facility. The regulated substance stored is propane.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCEC has a documented Prevention Program for the propane process that documents release prevention measures. These prevention measur"

      "SummaryText": "es include elements such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit and Contractor Safety. CEC employees who are involved in propane operations and maintenance are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of propane at the facility.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe CEC facility has not had any reportable releases of any regulated substances since operation commenced.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nCEC is a non-responding facility, as defined by USEPA (29 CFR Part 40 CFR Part 311). Therefore, CEC has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The CEC Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to a propane emergency and has coordinated this plan with Howell County Emergency Management and Willow Springs Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a propane emergency at the CEC facility. CEC employees are not designated responders to a propane release. As specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, CEC's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified through continued operations in 2021. Planned improvements include the addition of automatic shutoffs for propane compressors, with expected completion date of March 2022.\n\n"
