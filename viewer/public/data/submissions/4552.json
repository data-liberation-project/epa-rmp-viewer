To that end, this executive summary has been written to briefly describe our EPA mandated Risk Management Plan that has been reported to the EPA prior to the June 21, 1999 deadline.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONCE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY:\n\n     Paducah Water Works takes great pride in its efforts to prevent an accidental release of, and emergency response to, our chlorine cylinders.  We have taken steps to isolate our chlorine cylinders from the outside environment and from the day-to-day activities that take place at our facility.  We have done this by fully enclosing the chlorine tanks from the rest or the process and from the outside environment.  Only trained and authorized personnel are allowed around the chlorine cylinders.  This ensures that only controlled activity occurs in the restricted area.\n\n     The following two items are also utilized within the realm of accidental release prevention and emergency response.\n\n1.          All key personnel have received 40 hour HAZWOPER training (technical level) and eight hour annual  refresher training required by OSHA, so that we can respond to any incident that could occur on site and minimize any safety, health, or environmental impact to our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\n2.        Paducah Water Works also works in conjunction with local Disaster and Emergency Service (McCracken County D.E.S.) agency and City Fire Department to ensure that all area emergency personnel are familiar with our facility and what would need to be done in the unlikely event an accidental release occured.\n\n\nFACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\n     We are a water treatment facility using liquefied chlorine as one of the treatment agen"

      "SummaryText": "ts.  We are a level III reporting agency according to the EPA's Risk Management guidlines.  We have a complete Process Safety Management program based on Chlorine, which was last reviewed on 02/01/1999, as required by OSHA.  We used a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis to serve as our Process Hazard Analysis method.  The last changes to our Process Hazard Analysis were done on 05/05/1999 concerning major hazards including toxic release, equipment failure, and tornado activity.  There are several Process Controls in use which include:  vents, relief valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, and emergency generated power that aid in the detection and prevention of accidental releases.  All of these controls ensure us that no accidental release will occur from the Paducah Water Works facility.\n\n     Our mitigation system consists of enclosure, berm, and monitoring/detection systems that include:  Process area detectors, Perimeter monitors, and Portable air monitoring devices that are in use continuously.\n     Training take place in the classroom and on the job with all employees.  Testing for training effectiveness is done through observation, demonstration, and written exams.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\n\n     When determing our worst case scenario and alternative scenario, we utilized the help of the \"Cameo\" program provided in this Risk Management Program.\n\n     WORST-CASE RELEASE SPECIFICS:\n\n     The likelihood of this case presenting itself in \"real life\" is extremely remote due to all detection,   emergency procedures and emergency equipment in place.\n\n                    2,000 pound chlorine cylinder complete loss of content.\n                    Flow rate of 110 lbs./min.\n                    10 min. to completely empty cylinder.\n                    Wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.\n                    Urban area.\n                    0.9 mile distance to endpoint.\n                    Po"

This allows for the quickest responce time to a problem and the shortest wait possible in correcting the difficulty.  Paducah Water Works also works closely with the local Disaster and Emergency Service, City Fire Department, and other emergency entities that could be involved in the event of an emergency.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n     While always up to date, Paducah Water Works is always improving upon its training and continuing education programs.  Audits are also conducted at each facility every three years as required by  the Process Safety Management to ensure that no other steps need to be taken to prevent any accidents or emergency releases."
