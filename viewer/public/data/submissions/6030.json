      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility.  This facility complies with requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Randy Whalen who is employed by West Bend Elevator and is also Dickens Fire Dept Chief.  Randy will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.    This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  This would result in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  There are an estimated 574 people within this radius.  Residences, commercial businesses, offices, and recreation areas are also located in this area.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with regulations and  state law.    We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Dickens Fire Dept and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Clay County Disaster Coordinator, Dickens Fire Dept Chief and members.  The Dickens fire department has inspected our NH3 facility.   We have no plans at this time to improve or change our plans.  We review the plans annually or sooner if necessary."
