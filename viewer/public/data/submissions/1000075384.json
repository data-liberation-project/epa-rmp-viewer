This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and instructions for contacting outside responders for assistance. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. A copy of the site's emergency plans has been sent to the appropriate LEPC. In the event of an off-site release, County Emergency Management will provide for warning and evacuation / shelter-in-place for the general public.\r\n\r\nThrough our PSM/RMP program, we are continuously looking for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."

Since we are a new company to the area, we are working to build relationships with the Moore Fire Department and the Cleveland County LEPC.  We will be an active member of the LEPC.  We have hired a dedicated EHS Manager and RMP/PSM consultant to review current policies and procedures.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation; however, because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry consensus codes and standards where appropriate.
