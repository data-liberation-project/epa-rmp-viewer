Protective coating and sealant industry. The company was established in the year 1972. Over the years it has consistently improved in technology, research, development and manufacturing to provide the quality, durability and ease of application demanded by the construction industry. PPI provides architectural, technical, and field suport in many cities, states, and countries. The products are available nationally and internationally through authorized distributors.\n\nPPI products are based on Polyurethane, Polyurea, Epoxy, Polysulfide abd Latex Emulsion polymers. The Risk Management Program (RMP) is based upon the concept that health, safety and environmental issues must be considered in all parts of the raw material usage, in PPI case, Toluene Diisocyanate (mixed Isomers) and Isophorone Diisocyanate (IPDI). PPI has developed programs and procedures to ensure that appropriate information is available and has been provided to those handling the raw material. PPI is commited to assist its customers with all the products manufactured using TDI and IPDI based polymers. \n\nIn selecting raw materials for new and existing products, PPI considers the potential environmental impact of the materials at research, manufacturing and application sites, their impact on the community. PPI is commited to supply information to transporters and customers via the Material Safety Data Sheet, Product literature, labels and/or via telephone.\n\nInformation which may affect the process or final product is reviewed. Such reviews may include product specifications or process modifications that may affect environmental and safety concerns, product quality and properties.\n\nThis RMP program is developed for Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI)(Mixed Isomers) and IPDI that is listed as Toxic Reportable Material. The program includes: 1) Company Info"

      "SummaryText": "rmation (Registration), 2) Toxic Worst Case Scenerio, 3) Alternate Release, 4) Prevention Program that includes Check List and Process Hazard Analysis and 5) Emergency Response Program. \n\nPPI have prevented any accident release for Toluene Diisocyanate, Isophorone Diisocyanate as well as other chemicals present at the facility since it's establishment. The worst case scenerio was calculated using the RMP Comp. software program to determine the toxic endpoint distance. The IPDI scenerio was determined using the Aloha Software. The maximum amount of TDI and IPDI stored at one time will not exceed 50, 000 pounds. Both storage tanks are diked that can contain the spill to the maximum, i.e. the dike has volume capacity of 18,000 gallons. The dike area is coated completely, i.e. the floor as well as the wall with Novolac Epoxy Coating that is highly chemical resistant. Based on the calculation, the toxic endpoint determined is 0.1 miles or less. There is no residential population within the 0.1 mile radial area. There are no schools within this area. The Alternate Release Scenerio was determined to be 0.1 miles or less also. There are industries around PPI to whom PPI can inform immediately as well as take the emergency agency's help to notify them in case of emergency.\n\nPPI has written the prevention programs as per OSHA regulations. The program includes 1) Spill Prevention and Containment, 2) First Aid, 3) Protective Equipment and Clothing, 4) Hazard Communication, 5) Evacuation Procedure,and 6) Operating procedure. The emrgency program has been written. The program includes the responsibilities of the Managers, Supervisors and Employees, notification to the administrative agency (Fire department, Public, CUPA) and coordination with the agency.\n\nPacific Polymers have developed maintenance program of the mixing equipment and storage tanks. A respiratory fit test for all the employees has been discussed in the safety meeting. Few proposals are being evaluated. Since the l"

The unit is a charcoal filter.\n3) Few Contingency kits has been made and stored at various locations.\n4) Maintenance schedules are being performed periodically. \n5) Direct pipeline has been installed so that employees do not get exposed directly to TDI and IPDI.\n6)Use of TDI and IPDI detectors shall be recommended for purchase."
