The system is designed for use under severe weather or other conditions in which a natural gas curtailment is issued forcing the reduction of city gas services.  For the past several years, the city has not operated the plant but has kept it operational for emergency needs.  The plant has a capacity of 334,000 SCFH equivalent natural gas at 150 psig.  The plant contains 14 - 30,000 gallon liquid propane storage tanks with associated piping, valves, pumps, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe worst case scenariao is a failure of one of the 30,000 gallon propane tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's RMP*Comp, the distance to the endpoint is 0.4 miles.  There are 8 businesses and two city owned properties within this distance with 0 residents.  The unimproved portion of a city owned golf course is also within this distance.  There are no schools or hospitals or environmental receptors within this distance.  The alternative case scenario for our faciltiy results in a 0.10 mile distance to the endpoint.  There are no people living within this distance and there is a portion of one industry.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, or property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelters in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the propane system, it is our policy to notify the City of Warner Robins Fire Department by way of the 911 service and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed "
