      "SummaryText": "The Lawter International, Inc Moundville, Alabama plant consists of two separate operations subject to regulations under the Risk Management Plan; a batch process which manufactures synthetic resins (Krumbhaar Plant) and a continuous process which produces hydrocarbon resins (Hydrocarbon Plant).\n\nThe Krumbhaar plant produces rosin based resins in 20,000 and 30,000 pound reactors through an endothermic reaction process.  The resin is pumped to flaking belts where it is cooled and bagged for sale and transport.  The process of manufacturing polyamid resins in the Krumbhaar plant requires the use of ethylene diamine.  Ethylene diamine is stored in a 10,000 gallon heated storage tank at atmospheric pressure with a maximum inventory of 74,000 pounds.  The formulation for the manufacture of ketone resins, also in the Krumbhaar plant includes formaldehyde (34%).  The formaldehyde is stored in a 15,500 gallon atmospheric bulk storage tank at a maximum inventory level of 126,000 pounds.  \n\nThe hydrocarbon process begins by mixing hydrocarbon resin oils and solvents, then continuously reacting the materials using a catalyst, deactivation of the catalyst, filtration and evaporation to obtain correct product specification.  The hydrocarbon process requires the use of boron trifluoride as a catalyst.  The boron trifluoride is stored in a pressurized trailer provided by Allied Signal, the boron trifluoride manufacturer, at a maximum inventory of 1700 pounds in each cylinder.\n\nThe hazards associated with each regulated chemical is related to the chemistry and mechanics of the processes.  Ehtylene diamine is flammable and corrosive in the liquid and vapor phases, and has the potential to form explosive mixtures if released to the atmosphere.  Release of this material can lead to respiratory irritation due to inhalation exposure and can pose a fire hazard.  Formaldehyde (34%) is combustible in the liquid and vapor phases, and can cause physical harm to the respiratory system if inha"

      "SummaryText": "led.   Boron trifluoride is a compressed gas which forms a dense vapor cloud upon release.  Exposure to boron trifluoride gas can cause severe irritation and corrosive burns to exposed areas of the body.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a hazardous event involving ethylene diamine in the polyamid manufacturing process would create a toxic cloud with an endpoint 0.2 miles from the source.  This could potentially affect a population of 3 people, and an industrial area.  The alternative release scenario involving ethylene diamine in the polyamid manufacturing process, which includes a release from a transfer pipeline, would have a toxic endpoint 0.1 miles from the source and has no potential receivers. The ketone process involving formaldehyde (34%) could create a worst case release scenario with a toxic endpoint 1.4 miles from the source.  This event could potentially affect a population of 150, an industrial area, and a state park.  An alternative release scenario related to the ketone process involving formaldehyde (34%), results in a release from a pipeline, would create a toxic cloud within 0.1 miles from the source.   The alternative release scenario does not have the potential to affect any public or environmental receptors.  The worst case release scenario for the hydrocarbon resin process involving boron trifluoride would potentially affect an area 2.7 miles from the source.  This release scenario could result in toxic exposure to a population of 560 people, schools, a recreation area, an industrial area, and a state park.  The alternative release scenario for the hydrocarbon resin process involving boron trifluoride, which includes a release from a broken pipeline, would affect an area 0.8 miles from the source.  The affects would potentially reach a population of 48 people, a recreation area, and industrial area.  \n\nEach affected production process has chemical release mitigation systems in place to provide protection against probable hazardous scenarios"

      "SummaryText": ".  The plant utilizes dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, and physical enclosures to reduce the potential for material release.  Any bulk hazardous materials are stored in dikes which meet regulatory sizing requirements and have appropriately sized sumps for additional release control.  The importance of mitigation systems is emphasized throughout all engineering design projects and process upgrades.  The plant has installed mitigation systems, process control equipment, and provides employee emergency response training to reduce the effects of any potential hazard.  Lawter International realizes the importance of installing mitigation systems and providing training for reducing the hazardous potential of release scenarios to employees and the community, and also strives to monitor employee exposure situations through industrial hygiene evaluations.  Lawter stands behind a philosophy that requires comprehensive employee training to support a structured management system.   Employees are trained on each stage of the management system including emergency response, process safety information, process technological information, management of change, process operating procedures, and incident investigation.  As a result of extensive training efforts and a pursuit of safe operation, all employees are ultimately held accountable for safe working conditions and hazard minimization.  \n\nLawter International has charted a path for continuous improvement under the guidance of Business Excellence.  This philosophy of business is not only directed toward product quality and customer relations, but also plant operations, safety, and environmental awareness.  Lawter International holds a strict policy of immediate incident investigation following any type of unsafe event.  These results of these investigations are used to improve operations and amend procedures for safe working practices in the future.  Similarly, management of change policies are implemented to aid"

In addition, the recommendations of process hazard analyses are used as a basis for maintenance and project planning efforts in the future.  Each recommendation is considered during the budgeting and planning stages of projects for affected processes.  Currently, Lawter is researching and developing improved methods for the unloading and storage of ethylene diamine and improved safe storage facilities for boron trifluoride based on internal audit and PHA recommendations.\n\nThe emergency response procedures (ERP) for the Moundville facility provide the necessary information to operators in the event of a hazardous situation.   The ERP provides contact information for all local, state, and federal emergency response agencies and company management.  The procedures outline the steps to be taken in response to fire, spill, and injuries in an effort to reduce the impact on plant infrastructure and more importantly any public receptors that might be affected."
