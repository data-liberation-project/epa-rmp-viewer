The purpose of this program is to reduce or eliminate the possibility of accidental release of substances regulated under these guidelines.\n\nIn the Desert Water Agency's daily operation, chlorine gas is used for the disinfection of potable and reclaimed water.  Currently chlorine gas is stored and used at the Agency's Wastewater Reclamation Facilities in quantities greater than the process threshold limits specified under OSHA PSM, California CALarp and US EPA Risk Management Program regulations.  The regulations require that a Risk Management Program be developed, and be submitted for any processes that includes use of quantities of regulated substances greater than the process threshold limits.  \n\nDesert Water Agency currently uses the Reclamation Facility as a chlorine gas storage and chlorination facility.  Vessels stored at the facility include 150-lb. cylinders and one-ton containers.  Maximum intended chlorine gas inventory calculations performed in the RMP show the maximum intended inventory of chlorine gas stored at the Reclamation Facilities to be 27,000 lbs.  This amount is greater than the EPA's RMP Threshold Limit of 2,500 lbs. and OSHA's PSM Threshold limit of 1,500 lbs., and therefore falls under these regulations.\n\nSince this facility falls under OSHA's PSM regulations and there is a potential for chlorine gas to reach offsite receptors, the Chlorination Process at the Reclamation Facilities falls under Program Level 3 of the RMP's regulations.\n\nIn accordance with regulation requirements, the Agency reviewed the accident history at the Reclamation Facilities for the past five years.  The Agency has not experienced an accident resultin"

Therefore, no accident history exists.\n\nAn Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed during the program development.  A worst-case release scenario and alternate-case release scenarios were performed to assess the possible effects of an accidental release\n\n\n\n\nA Summary of these scenarios are included below:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario CLW-1:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a direct release of one one-ton container over a 10-minute period as required by the regulations.\n\nAlternate-case Release Scenarios:\n\nCLA-1:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a hole in the middle of one end of the tank.  The model predicts that the chlorine escapes as a mixture of gas and liquid (two-phase flow).\n\nCLA-2:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a release from a vertical cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a hole in the middle of the top of the tank.  The chlorine escapes only as a gas.\n\n\nCLA-3:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a short pipe or valve in the top, of the tank.  The chlorine escapes only as a gas.\n\n\nCLA-4:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a valve or fusible plug in the bottom of the tank.  The chlorine escapes as a mixture of gas and liquid (two-phase flow).\n\n\nCLA-5:\n\nThis scenario was modeled as a release of chlorine gas from a 3/4 diameter manifold connected to two one-ton containers.  The chlorine gas escapes as a gas.\n\n\n\n\nThe RMP was prepared in accordance with regulation requirements and includes EPA Program 3 Prevention Elements.  These prevention elements are outlined in the regulations and were developed and adopted by the Agency for these facilities to reduce or eliminate the possibility of the occur"

The Agency maintains up-to-date written Emergency Action Plans (EAP's) and effective response capabilities for the covered process.  Comprehensive EAP's, emergency response training and drills are an integral part of the Agency's effort to ensure quick and effective emergency response.  The Agency's response personnel have been trained in accordance with HAZWOPER guidelines and are HAZWOPER Incident Commanders/On-Scene Managers.  The Agency has adopted SEMS and works within the County of Riverside's operational area as a Special District.\n\nAs part of the development of the Prevention Elements, the Agency performed a Process Hazard Analysis.  This Analysis included a review of chlorine gas safety devices currently used at the Reclamation Facilities.  Based upon results of this review, the Agency has found that new technology allows room for improvement with regard to active mitigation measures for containment of chlorine gas in the event of a leak.  Therefore the Agency has tentatively budgeted for the purchase and installation of a Chlorine Gas Scrubber in the 1999-2000 Fiscal Year.  It is the Agency's belief that although the Facilities have an exemplary safety record and no history of accidental releases, the addition of a Chlorine Gas Scrubber will provide the best active mitigation efforts for containment of potential chlorine gas releases.\n\n\n"
