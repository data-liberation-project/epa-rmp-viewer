      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under Section 68.115.\r\n\r\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Water Works, Richard Miller Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes more than a threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to resubmit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in Section 68.150 by September 9, 2014 (five years after the previous filing on September 2, 2009) Public employees are covered under the State of Ohio's Public Employee Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), which has adopted by reference the requirements of OSHA's (PSM) Standard.  Based on the March 1999 revised USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) (EPA 550-B-98-010), the Richard Miller WTP is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and is therefore subject to Program 3 requirements of the RMP Regulation.  \r\n\r\nUSEPA's RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary.  The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items requ"

These prevention measures include elements such as employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  \r\n\r\nRichard Miller WTP is equipped with many safety features to prevent any public exposure in the unlikely event of a chlorine leak.

      "SummaryText": "emergency and has coordinated this plan with the City of Cincinnati Hazardous Materials Response Unit.  The City of Cincinnati Hazardous Materials Response Unit personnel are the designated first responders in the event of a non incidental chlorine emergency.  Richard Miller WTP employees are not designated first responders to a serious or unplanned chlorine release.  As specified in 40 CFR 68.90(b), Richard Miller WTP's Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed, and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 68.155(f): Safety Improvements:\r\n \r\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which was completed per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(e) on July 31, 2014.  Recommended improvements were identified in three main categories: Standard Operating Procedures, Maintenance, and Training.  According to the PSM, any safety improvements will be investigated concerning their impacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional recommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the PHA is updated every five years."

      "SummaryText": "ntainers of chlorine (greatest amount held in a single vessel).  It is assumed that the container ruptures and its entire contents escape from the building in 10 minutes.  The passive mitigation of the building is not considered.  Additionally, the worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.   The rate of chlorine released to the outdoor air for the worst case scenario is 200 pounds per minute.  Using the USEPA RMP Comp software, a toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles was determined for the worst case scenario.  Using LandView 6) issue date 12/03) the residential population within a 1.3 mile radius of influence for the Richard Miller WTP Post-Chlorination Facility was determined to be approximately 2979 people. The radius of influence includes residences and parks, but does not encompass any schools, hospitals, or prisons.\r\nNeither the passive mitigation of the building nor the functions of the scrubber were taken into consideration for this scenario. \r\n\r\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario selected was that of a 3/16 inch diameter opening in a valve, gasket, flexible tubing, or piping occurring inside the enclosed Storage/Unloading Room or Chlorine Feed Room.  This results in a release rate of 3.0 pounds of chlorine per minute for 30 minutes. The USEPA Comp software gives a distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario.  The residential population within a 0.1 mile radius of influence of the Richard Miller WTP Post-Chlorination Facility as determined by LandView 6 is approximately zero persons.  The radius of influence does not include residences, schools, hospitals, recreation areas, prisons, or major commercial, office, or industrial areas. Neither the passive mitigation of the building nor the functions of the scrubber were"
