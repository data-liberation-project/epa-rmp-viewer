These programs are documented so that information about safe handling of chemicals at the facility is readily available to all employees and in the event questions arise from public officials regarding potential risks to the community. \n\nThe Cargill Cedar Rapids facility's safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of on-going evaluations of safety and programs.  In January 2016, the facility was officially recognized as a STAR site under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  Recertification under this program was obtained in April 2019. In order to achieve this elite designation, the facility submitted over 60 pages of information describing the facility's safety programs.  Auditors from OSHA then conducted an intense onsite audit reviewing the facility's equipment and structures, its documentation as well as conducting interviews with a wide variety of employees.  This audit included Cargill's management of highly hazardous chemicals.   Companies who receive VPP status are considered role models in their industry and have attained a high degree of management support and employee involvement in the safety program.   By participating in VPP and receiving the STAR designation, Cargill Cedar Rapids has demonstrated that it has a rigorous commitment to maintaining a safe work environmental for its employees and the community.  As part of maintaining its STAR status, Cargill Cedar Rapids will do regular self-reviews of its programs to identify improvement opportunities and will also receive periodic recertification audits from OSHA. \n\nAll of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at the Cargill Cedar Rapids facility lead to operations that are safe today, but will be even safer tomorrow."

Cargill has developed procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency. If an emergency release of PO occurs that is beyond what would be considered an incidental release that employees are trained to handle as part of their routine operational duties, Cargill will initiate plant evacuation procedures.  Cargill will rely on the Cedar Rapids Fire Department, Linn County HAZ-MAT team, and Area Ambulance/Paramedic Services for assistance as required to control and resolve emergencies.\n\nPlant operation at the Cargill Cedar Rapids facility can present various types of potential hazards and Cargill recognizes the need to have a well-trained and prepared work force to safely and effectively deal with emergency situations. A preventative maintenance program to inspect and test emergency response equipment has been established. Classroom training and drills are conducted to ensure responsible staff know the appropriate response in the event of an emergency. Emergency response training exercises have included the Cedar Rapids Fire Department, CRFD or Linn County HAZ-MAT team, Area Ambulance/Paramedic Services and the LEPC. Important communication links with the community are maintained through Cargill plant staff attendance at regularly scheduled meetings with local industry and emergency response planning officials.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nCargill's Cedar Rapids Corn Milling facility, under the RMP program, as well as its existing PSM and earlier SARA Title III Community Right-to-Know Act compliance programs has organized its management system to effectively address foreseeable hazards and potential risks.

The Cargill Cedar Rapids facility's safety program incorporates continuous improvement through use of on-going evaluations of safety and programs.\n\nIn conjunction with the current RMP and PSM programs in place at the Cedar Rapids Corn Milling facility, there is a standard management practice that requires internal reporting of unusual events, including those in which any abnormal emission of regulated chemicals is observed or suspected. The incident information is reviewed and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity of any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved. If so, the appropriate authorities are notified.\n\nFive Year Accident History.\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no accidents involving any RMP regulated substance that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68. This means that no accident has resulted in reportable on-site injury, off-site injury, evacuations, sheltering in place, or damage to property or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program.\n\nCargill's Cedar Rapids facility has established an Emergency Action Plan to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect the public health and the environment, as well as the safety of the plant employees.
