Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. is committed to compliance with all laws and regulations, the safety of employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive ammonia release prevention program that includes areas such as system design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, security and a comprehensive employee training program associated with all ammonia processes.  Airgas Specialty Products policy is for all facilities to meet ANSI K61.1 standards for \"Safety Requirements for The Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Company policy also requires the implementation of appropriate controls to prevent releases of ammonia to the atmosphere. Airgas Specialty Products strives to prevent emergency situations, but maintains an Emergency Action Plan to be prepared should an emergency situation develop.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary business at the subject facility is the Distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is not produced at the subject facility; rather it is received via truck as a liquefied compressed gas. Ammonia is stored in ASME code pressure vessels and the storage and handling system meets OSHA, EPA and ANSI K61.1 requirements. Very little ammonia is released to the atmosphere at the Toppenish, WA  facility. Ammonia storage and transfer operations are accomplished in totally enclosed pressure systems designed to meet all code requirements.  The maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility is 150,000 lb.  All product is shipped from the facility over the road in DOT approved cylinders or vessels.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAirgas Specialty Products Inc. has implemented the accidental release "
