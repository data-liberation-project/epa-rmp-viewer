Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Mobil Oil Corporation, Hattiesburg LPG Storage Facility (Mobil), in Petal, Mississippi is a liquified petroleum gas storage facility.  The gases stored are propane and butane.  The facility utilizes certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  These safety precautions include: \n\n7 Effectively managing our process operations;\n7 Investing in the latest process safety technologies;\n7 Training and retraining our personnel;\n7 Reviewing our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n7 Ensuring safety is considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance.\n\nThe facility maintains a policy to be a good business partner; a safe and conscientious neighbor; and to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nMobil has a standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by our history of support and commitment to the community and our high environmental standards.  We are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continually strive to be the best.\n\n2.    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nMobil's facility contains the RMP regulated flammable substances of propane and butane.\n\n3.    Hazard Assessment Results\n\nThe RMP rule requires companies to develop chemical release scenarios that estimate the potential community impact from an accidental release.  These scenarios are useful for emergency planning in the event of an accident.  There are two types of scenarios required by the EPA.  The worst-case scenario (WCS) is the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance.  The alternative release scenario (ARS) allows industries to develop a more realistic planning scenario.\n\nA release of butane is the WCS and ARS"

The offsite impact is mitigated by our prevention programs listed in section one above. \n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMobil has developed an Environmental, Health & Safety Management System (EHSMS) which delineates the responsibilities of each team member to help prevent major incidents and protect human health and the environment. \n\nOur terminal superintendent has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  However, all personnel ensure that safe work practices, equipment design specifications, and maintenance schedules are adhered to thereby reducing the probability of an incident at the facility.\n\nMobil has developed programs to comply with all environmental, health, and safety laws.  We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases.  Our process management systems address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Process safety information             - Pre-startup review\n- Process hazard analysis             - Compliance audits\n- Operating procedures            - Incident investigation\n- Training                    - Employee participation\n- Mechanical integrity                - Hot work permit\n- Management of change             - Contractor safety\n\nOur risk management program uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.    \n\nWe train our employees to safely perform t"

Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made. \n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\nMobil's facility has had no accidents that meet the criteria for the Five-Year Accident History. \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program Information\n\nMobil is a member of the Petal Dome Mutual Aid (PDMA) group.  Mobil also has a national and regional response team with members trained to handle emergencies. \n\nThe PDMA has an emergency response plan which details procedures for accidental releases and includes notification of the Forrest County LEPC and other local authorities.  We maintain an \"open door\" policy with local emergency response organizations to help ensure maximum understanding and cooperation during an emergency.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMobil's facility personnel continually strive to improve all aspects of our safety programs to protect our workers and the public.\n"
