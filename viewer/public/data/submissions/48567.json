BCP had operated the facility until April 2002 when all process units were shutdown.  De-inventory of all chemicals was completed by September 2002.  In December 2002, WVC acquired a portion of the facility from BCP.   As required by 40 CFR 68.155, WVC is including with the Risk Management Plan Submission the following Executive Summary.                                                                                           \n\nWVC  has conducted EDC production operations since November 2003 and PVC and VCME production operations since December 2004.  WVC performed all appropriate equipment testing, HAZOPs, Pre start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR's), and all other startup procedures prior to startup of operations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWVC has a commitment to protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public. It is WVC policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and mechanical integrity program.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to minimize the potential for releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any possible"

The site is approximately 22 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the intersection of Louisiana Highways 73 and 30 near the rural town of Geismar, LA.  The facility began operation in 1961 under the direction of Borden Chemical, Inc. and was operated continuously until the entire plant was shut down in April 2002.  In December 2002, WVC acquired certain assets of the complex.  The plants now operated by WVC include vinyl chloride (including ethylene dichloride) and  polyvinyl chloride.  The remaining plants which included urea, urea-formaldehyde concentrate, acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde,  industrial gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), methanol, and air separation products (oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) are not owned by WVC and will not be operated by WVC.\n\nThe plant uses or produces the following RMP regulated substances in quantities above the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130:\n\nToxics:  chlorine and hydrogen chloride\nFlammables:  propylene and vinyl chloride\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at WVC?s Geismar facility.   Because the processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.   \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nWVC employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the process safety management program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each process safety program element. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWVC has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information and trained in how to use the information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including information on exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nWVC has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyse"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WVC will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWVC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nTraining\n\nWVC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, the operator can work independently.  In addition, all operators will receive refresher trainin"

This refresher training will be conducted at least once every three years.  All training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator comprehended the training.\n\nContractors\nWVC routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.  Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractors are provided both plant-wide and unit-specific training.   In addition, craftsmen must complete the eight-hour safety-training program for industrial workers provided by industry through the local safety council.  The training is maintained through annual refresher training.  \n\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work. WVC evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR?s)\n\nWVC conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or major facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWVC has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, as appropriate, or management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment until the actions are completed.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nWVC has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWVC has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, and equipment information, as well as procedures and drawings are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nThe management of change program is designed to allow anyone at the facility the ability to initiate a MOC.  Employees have been trained concerning the various elements that would constitute a change such as parts, procedures, operating conditions, etc.  The MOC change form provides an abbreviated version of the pre-startup review.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHA?s and PHA revalidations.  WVC implemented a non-conformance report database and an employee improvement program in November 2003.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, WVC periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The WVC Corporate HSE office conducted a PSM compliance audit in April 2005.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved.
