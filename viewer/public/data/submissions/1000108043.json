The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2701 East Road 1 South in Monte Vista, Colorado (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer.  There is one anhydrous ammonia tanker temporarily located at the facility for approximately four to eight days per year with a capacity of approximately 10,200 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is used by a mobile third party contractor in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.  The contents of the tank are consumed in entirety during the reaction process.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n  \nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.  The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety pr"

The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis and the third party contractor implement operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Monte Vista Fire Protection District (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n1.\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n2.\tInformation on emergency health care.\n3.\tEmergency response training for employees.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nWilbur-Ellis is implementing a proprietary comprehensive Safety Management System called Guiding People to Safety (GPS).  Key safety elements are established and divided into four discrete steps, which direct the site on continuous improvement.  RMP/PSM is one of those key elements.  Other elements include Management o"
