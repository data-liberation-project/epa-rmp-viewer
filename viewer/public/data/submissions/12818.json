The target date for removal of the temporary system is July 8, 1999.\n\nThe maintenance and operation of the prevention program is being performed by contract personnel.  The temporary flue gas conditioning system is designed to be a maintenance free stand alone system.  The only time Mississippi Power Company (MPC) personnel operate the conditioning system is when the unit boiler is down for extended maintenance.\n\nOperation of the conditioning system by MPC personnel consists of selecting the desired operational mode and pressing the indicator button.  This function is performed by trained MPC operations personnel.  The contorl panel for the flue gas conditioning system is also equipped with an emergency shut off in the event of a system malfunction.\n\nMississippi Power utilizes the Hazardous Substances Emergency Response Plan, Emergency Action Plan, Contractor Safety Program, HOt Work Program, Hazard Communication Program, Clearance and tagging Program, Barricade Tape Program, Respiratory Protection Program, and Safety Training & Recogintion of Unsafe Condition Programs to meet the Requirements of this section.",

      "SummaryText": "Mississippi Power Company's Daniel Electric Generating Plant, located near Escatawpa, Mississippi is a 2 Unit steam electric generating plant.  Sulfur Dioxide is currently utilized as an ash conditioner to enchance the collection of particulate matter within the unit's electrostatic percipitator.  The facility is currently installing a perminant sulfur burner to replace this material.  The Sulfur Dioxide is stored in a tanker which holds 40,000 lbs of Sulfur Dioxide.  The total quantity of Sulfur Dioxide exceeds the threshold limit of 5000 lbs contained within the 112r regulations.  The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program is required if the material is greater than 1000 lbs and Program 3 is required for Plant Daniel.\n\nThe main hazard that would be associated with the Sulfur Dioxide at Plant Daniel is a toxic hazard.  The most likely event is a transfer hose failure.  The system is equiped with relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoof valves.\n\nThe worst case and the alternative case utilized the Reference tables.  The model determined that the worst case scenario's toxic end point from the release of the Sulfur Dioxide would be 18 miles.  The alternate case scenario would reach a toxic end point at 1.7 miles.\n\nPlant Daniel has not had any spills of Sulfur Dioxide in the past five years and the material will be replaced when the sulfur burner is completed.\n\nEmergency Plans are coordinated with local response personnel."
