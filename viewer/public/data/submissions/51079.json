Vessels containing listed RMP chemicals are located in LPG storage areas 6-9.  The listed materials are used as feedstock for pilot plant R&D operations. These feedstocks are fed from LPG trailers to pilot plant processes by means of pipe at a variable rate of 1-300 lbs/hr. Process emissions are controlled by PSV's, rupture disks and a flare. All pilot plant processes are vented to the facility flare. PHA's for site R&D operations also include the LPG storage vessels.",
