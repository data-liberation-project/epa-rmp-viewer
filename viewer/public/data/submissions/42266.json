It is Brooks Foods\u00bf intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n\n1.0 POLICIES IN PLACE:\n\nBrooks Food Group, Inc., complies with Clean Air Act and Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air emissions regulations and has polices in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n2.0 SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE:\n\nBrooks Food Group of Bedford, Virginia is a food processing facility (SIC Code 2038).  Brooks Foods uses compressed anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) in its refrigeration system to cool and freeze foods.  Brooks Food Group, Bedford, Virginia stores approximately 10,000 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia on site.\n\n\n3.0 RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves the failure of the compressed storage tank containing approximately 5,500 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario, the entire amount is released over a ten-minute period at a rate of 550 lbs./minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint the anhydrous ammonia would travel, before dispersing enough to no longer pose a health hazard, is 1.20 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves the failure of a piping system of the storage tank releasing approximately 1,000 lbs. over a ten minute period at a rate of 100 lbs./minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.43 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations.   Brooks Food Group, Inc, relies on a system of equipment maintenance and periodic testin"

The facility relies entirely on local community emergency response teams to address releases.\n\n\n7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nBrooks Food Group Inc., has an ongoing maintenance training and operational training program to continuously update operator knowledge of systems within their facility."
