Kern Oil\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the handling of flammable regulated substances at the Kern Oil refinery located at 7724 E. Panama Lane, Bakersfield, CA 93307. The refinery handles crude oils and petroleum products containing one or more of the following flammable regulated substances:\n\n -  Methane\n -  Ethane\n -  Propane\n -  Butane\n -  Pentane\n -  Hydrogen\n\nc. Kern Oil  has in place a comprehensive release prevention program. Physical safeguards to prevent a release of a regulated substance include design and construction to strict national standards; monitoring, alarm and shutdown systems; extensive operating procedures and training; and rigorous inspection and maintenance routines. \n\nd. There has been no accident subject to RMP reporting requirements within the five years preceding this RMP update.\n\ne. Kern Oil has a comprehensive emergency response program in place to provide prompt but safe response to halt and/or mitigate a release. Kern Oil has worked closely with the Kern County Fire Department (KCFD) in developing its response plan.\n\nf. Kern Oil has been performing and revalidating Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) for all its process units on a systematic basis since 1993. The most recent PHA took place in June 2004. It was a revalidation of the PHA performed in May 1999 on the LPG Unloading and Storage Unit. Planned changes to improve safety arising from the revalidation include improved labeling."
