      "SummaryText": "Evans Chemetics\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n    \nMarch 2008\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Evans Chemetics are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Seneca County LEPC which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nEvans Chemetics was formed in Waterloo during the early 1940s to manufacture divalent sulfur compounds for the hair care and cosmetic industries.  Since that time, the number of products has grown to over 30, serving the cosmetic, plastics, and specialty chemical industries.  The products manufactured are sold to other manufactures as raw materials and ingredients in their final products.\n\nIn our processes, Evans Chemetics uses two regulated substances, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile] and epichlorohydrin [oxirane, (chloromethyl)-].  Acrylonitrile is used as a raw material to manufacture a variety of products, including secondary antioxidants for plastics and rubber and polymerization chain transfer agents.  Epichlorohydrin is also used as a raw material to manufacture products used in the photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.  Both chemicals are received by tank truck, and unloaded into nitrogen blanketed and vapor balanced bulk storage tanks.  Transfers from the bulk storage tanks to the site reactors are done in closed piping to eliminate employee and community exposure.  The reactions are also carried out in closed systems "

      "SummaryText": "with numerous process monitoring and controls.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEvans Chemetics has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  We presently have an air operating permit ID under Title V of the Clean Air Act, although the Title V permit will be changed to a State only air permit in May 2008.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEvans Chemetics maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Process safety information includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specification sheets and maintenance manuals, reactive chemical data, and materials of construction information.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Since the site was divested from The Dow Chemical Company in September 2005, the primary hazard analysis methodology changed from the Dow Reactive Chemical / Process Hazard Analysis methodology to HAZOP and LOPA (Layers of Protection Analysis) methodologies.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\nThe PHAs on all the covered processes, along with another hazardous process not covered by PSM or RMP, were re-done in 2007 and early 2008.  These updated PHAs included LOPA (Layers of Protection Analysis), wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich helped the site determine what the appropriate protective layers should be.  As a result, a number of process changes were made, and additional process controls are being added, as well as additional active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures are maintained on all the chemical processes operated at the facility.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEvans Chemetics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEvans Chemetics carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Evans Chemetics to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and trained to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in es"

      "SummaryText": "tablished processes are conducted as a regular practice at Evans Chemetics.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvans Chemetics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEvans Chemetics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEvans Chemetics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Evans Chemetics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur, and are required to inform Evans Chemetics of any hazards they may introduce "

      "SummaryText": "at the site.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nEvans Chemetics has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release of acrylonitrile or epichlorohydrin during this period as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nAll plant personnel are trained to recognize and initially respond to any release of chemicals.  Approximately 30% of the employees are trained at the 24 or 40 hour HAZWOPER level, and have the equipment and capability to properly respond to any chemical release.  In addition to Evans Chemetics' own emergency response capability, emergency planning and response is coordinated with the Seneca County LEPC (Local Emergency Response Committee).  \n\nDuring 2007, the Emergency Response Plan was updated to more clearly present the information needed in an emergency.  The off-site impacts of acrylonitrile, epichlorohydrin, and hydrogen sulfide releases were further modeled using RMPComp and Screen3 air dispersion modeling, with the results integrated into the Emergency Response Plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of Evans Chemetics' ongoing program to improve safety within the facility and reduce risk to the surrounding community, our processes and procedures are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.  Currently we are implementing or planning to implement the following risk reduction or prevention activities:\n\n?    A firefighting and foam suppression system is being added to the acrylonitrile and epichlorohydrin bulk storage nks and dikes to both extinguish any fire in the bulk tank dikes, and to suppress vapors from any spills or leaks.\n?    A process reactor catch tank system is being added to divert any process release through the various reactor relief systems into a catch tank to contain the release on-site, and not impact the community.\n?
