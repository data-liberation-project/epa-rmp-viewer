This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as extensive employee training and a standard practice to incorporate safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Additional safety precautions include safety systems such as alarms, shutdowns, and overpressure relief valves. These safety precautions provide protection for our employees' health and welfare and provide safeguards for the public and environment.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Bay Gas Conditioning Plant has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The Mobile Bay Gas Conditioning Plant has also implemented the elements of Williams Integrated Management Plan (WIMS), which contains additional environmental, health, and safety standards.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Bay Gas Conditioning Plant's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is site-specific. It includes procedures for notifying local, state, and federal agencies, as well as adjacent business.  Local officials including the LEPC have reviewed the emergency response plan. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, \"While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 2: The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the Mobile Bay facility is the"

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in these procedures annually unless changes have occurred, which are communicated immediately. The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes. Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Mobile Bay Gas Conditioning Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and emergency response organizations, such as Mobile Fire-Rescue Department, Mobile County EMS, Life Flight Aeromedical Services, and Transco Station 82 (receptor) at the facility. This coordination includes attending periodic meetings consisting of a review of the emergency operation procedures as well as opportunities to participate in a tabletop exercise to discuss sequences of events during an emergency and the roles of responding agencies.
