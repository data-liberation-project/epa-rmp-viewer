Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJCI is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that facilities continuously identify methods to provide the safest working environment possible to its employees and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance/procedure manuals, which are available to all employees. This facility stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the facility. This facility's safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings of all employees. JCI has an environmental manual and a safety manual that cover general environmental and safety best practices and compliance topics. Each employee at this facility has access to the environmental and safety manuals that cover topics specific to this facility. There are regularly scheduled safety and environmental audits conducted by facility management, and periodic safety and environmental audits of the facility conducted by JCI corporate personnel. This risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (Appendix A).\n\n2. The JCI Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary function of this facility is to protect public health by supplying chemicals including chlorine and sodium hypochlorite to disinfect bulk water systems. The primary operations conducted at this facility include the distribution of inorganic chemicals and repackaging of inorganic gases. Chemicals are brought on site in bulk qu"

Any residual compressed gas is absorbed in an appropriate solution and sold as product. The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n3. The Worse-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe WCS for toxic substances at this facility is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a single 90-ton chlorine railcar. This is the scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/1). Chlorine is a dense toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure at atmospheric temperature. For the WCS release analysis, the following assumptions were made: a ground-level release of 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine over 10 minutes; generally flat, unobstructed (rural) terrain surrounding the facility; and atmospheric conditions of 1.5 meter per second (mps) wind speed, F stability class, and 77|F ambient temperature. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario as required by the RMP regulations. Dispersion modeling of the WCS was conducted using RMP*Comp version 1.03. RMP*Comp was developed for use in performing the OCA required under EPA's Risk Management Planning rule.\n\nTo assist in emergency response planning, this facility has developed ACSs as required by the RMP regulations. ACSs and hazard assessment results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by the facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event. These scenarios are unlikely, but are physically possible. For the ACS analyses, the following assumptions were made: rural terrain surrounding the facility and atmospheric conditions of 3.0 mps wind speed, D"

This facility conducted dispersion modeling of the ACSs using RMP*Comp.\n\nThe first ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a crack in a whip (transfer) line at the 1-ton chlorine cylinder filling station. This facility believes that this scenario, although unlikely, could occur based on its knowledge of similar accidents that have occurred at other chlorine facilities. A whip line crack would not result in a significant release of chlorine from a tank or vessel, because chlorine detectors continually monitor the area and the railcar unloading station is equipped with automatic shutdown valves. However, a whip line crack could result in a 5-second jet release of liquid chlorine from a process line or a gas cylinder from a height of 1 meter. Five seconds was the estimated maximum time required for an operator or emergency responder to respond to an alarm from area detectors and close the valve on the whip line. The estimated size of the crack in the line is equivalent to a 1/8-inch diameter hole. The amount of chlorine released from an open, 6-foot long, 1/8-inch diameter opening in the line at 165 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), would be 7.5 pounds, including the volume of chlorine in the line, at a rate of 89.9 pounds per minute.\n\nThe second ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a crack in a whip (transfer) line at the 1-ton sulfur dioxide cylinder filling station.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe prevention programs described in this facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits. This facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals.\n\n5.

The five-year accident history allows the Jacksonville Facility to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the on-site and off-site impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will ever occur again. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence.\n\nPersonnel at the Jacksonville Facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998 to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Five accidental releases were identified.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Plan\n\nOverall safety at this facility is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases. This facility therefore developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has a trained emergency response team (ERT), appropriate equipment and supplies, and a detailed Contingency Plan. The Contingency Plan outlines the procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance and specifies notification, evacuation, and release control and containment measures for accidental releases that may occur at the facility or on the highway (i"

The agencies and individuals represent local emergency responders (e.g., fire department), public notification and regulatory reporting requirements (e.g., EPA), and internal notification (e.g., Branch Manager, Corporate Headquarters). Written coordination agreements that document arrangements with local emergency responders are maintained in the Contingency Plan Manual.\n\nThe Contingency Plan includes plans to respond to releases of regulated substances, and identifies the ERT training requirements, qualifications, and responsibilities within the incident command system. The ERT comprises individuals from operations, maintenance, and engineering. In addition to the ERT, this facility has identified, properly trained, and properly equipped employees to administer first aid until the outside responders arrive. Al ERT members complete on-site annual eight-hour refresher training.\n\nThe Contingency Plan includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of regulated and other extremely hazardous substances. The procedures identify the individuals by training level that perform the actions, administrative and engineering controls (e.g., ventilation), the required PPE, first aid requirements, and required equipment.\n\nThis facility maintains emergency response equipment and PPE for use by the ERT and the fire department.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.\n\nJCI Jacksonville personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases):\n\nAccident Investigation Reports\nJob Safety Analyses\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nNo action items meeting the selection criteria were identified."
