Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care requirements and governmental requirements, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. is a subsidiary plant of UCAR Emulsion Systems, with headquarters in Cary, NC.  UCAR Emulsion Systems is a division of the Union Carbide Corporation, one of the world\u0012s leading manufacturers of basic and specialty chemicals.  Since its inception in 1977, UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has been dedicated to the manufacture of emulsion polymers for use throughout the paint, adhesives and architectural coatings industry.  The site covers a total area of 4.3 acres located in lot 38, on \u0014B\u0013 street of Luchetti Industrial Park, in the city of Bayamon, Puerto Rico.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc., has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has the following RMP-regulated toxic substance at levels above threshold quantities: \n\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. has no RMP-regulated flammable substances in amounts exceeding the specified threshold limits.\n\n3."

The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA) \tRegulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM):  Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) is stored in a 10,000 gallon storage tank located towards the east end of the facility.  The  scenario assumes the total collapse of this storage tank, releasing 78,200 pounds of VAM as a liquid to the spill containment basin.  Written operating procedures and a high-level interlock shutdown system limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 95 percent in volume (74,290 pounds). According to EPA\u0012s Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following passive mitigation measure was used in this analysis:\n\n7- Secondary Containment:  The tank is located inside a concrete dike sufficiently impervious to contain and prevent permeation of any liquid leaks from the tank. \n\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n\n7- Tank Construction:  The tank is constructed of material that is not attacked by the stored chemical (stainless steel) according to recognized industry codes and standards for containment and overall safety.\n\n7- High Level Interlock Shutdown System:  An high level alarm activ"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years, there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at UCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nUCAR Resinas Caribe, Inc. maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\n\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\n7.
