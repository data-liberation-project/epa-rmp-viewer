Highway 4 and the Antioch Bridge are just east of the site. Immediately south and west of the site are existing industrial facilities. The river borders the north side, while a recreational marina, open space, and additional industrial land uses are present east of the site. \r\n\r\nThe GGS combined cycle power unit consists of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), and one steam turbine generator. In the combined cycle process, electricity is generated from the combustion turbines and the steam turbine. Each combustion turbine generator converts the thermal energy of the natural gas fuel to mechanical energy, which drives the electrical generator. At the same time, the thermal energy from the exhaust flue gas off the combustion turbines is directed to the HRSG to convert pressurized water into steam, which turns the steam turbine to drive the electricity generator. The facility also includes two 195-foot-tall exhaust stacks on the HRSGs, one air-cooled condenser system, a wet surface air cooler, storage tanks, a control building, electrical power transformers, and transmission facilities to interconnect the generated electricity to the power grid.\r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is used in the GGS's SCR system to reduce NOX emissions and for condensate pH control. Up to 18,020 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution (39,628 pounds of ammonia in solution) are present in the processes at any given time. \r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia stored and handled at the GGS exceeds the Risk Management Program and CalARP Program threshold quantities, but not the PSM threshold quantities. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject to Risk Management Program and CalARP Program regulations, but not PSM requirements."

The most recent HR update of the aqueous ammonia process was conducted in November 2012. A seismic assessment was also conducted in November 2012.\r\n\r\nDuring these studies and inspections, several additional risk reduction measures were recommended to improve safety at the GGS. Details of the recommendations from the most recent HR can be found in the action item tables attached with this section and in Section 2, Hazard Review, of the GGS's Risk Management Program. The risk reduction measures included confirming vendor procedures, confirming maintenance procedures, confirming operating procedures, and considering additional equipment labeling. The GGS uses the action item tables developed for the HR to track progress and timely closure of action items from technical studies. The GGS also reports the number of recommended action items, the number of action items completed, and the number of action items in progress. Nine recommended action items were identified as a result of the HR and all have been completed or resolved."

The GGS uses aqueous ammonia in its selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) to the atmosphere, as well as for condensate hydrogen ion content (pH) control. As the company responsible for operating GGS, PG&E takes its safety obligations in storing and using aqueous ammonia seriously. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps PG&E takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\n1.2 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nPG&E's vision is to be the leading utility in the United States; to that effect, PG&E's values are presented below:\r\n\r\n- We act with integrity and communicate honestly and openly.\r\n- We are passionate about meeting our customers' needs and delivering for our shareholders.\r\n- We are accountable for all of our own actions; these include safety, protecting the environment, and supporting our communities.\r\n- We work together as a team and are committed to excellence and innovation.\r\n- We respect each other and celebrate our diversity.\r\n\r\nThe GGS accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.
