It is the company\u0012s policy to maintain a work environment that is safe for all employees and conducive to attaining high work standards.\n\nSafety rules and guidelines are based on recognized safe practices, standards federal, state and local regulations and industry recommended practices.  Every employee is responsible for compliance with company\u0012s safety requirements and their full cooperation is necessary for accident prevention and loss control \n\nThe prevention of accidents is of the utmost importance to the management of Crockett Gas.  Anyone who is aware of an accident hazard is expected to correct the hazard or report it so that it can be corrected.\n\nContractors working on Crockett\u0012s property are also expected to maintain a high level of safety awareness and to conduct their operation in a safe manner.  Contractors will provide Crockett a copy of their health and safety program upon request.\n\nFacility Description \nThe Ozona gas plant takes in low pressure wet natural gas from hydrocarbon reservoirs for processing of recoverable liquid propane/butane and gasoline products.  The natural gas is compressed for high pressure processing and cooling to recover the liquids.  The liquids are sent to storage in pressured vessels for later transfer and sale by pressurized transport trucks that load at the liquid sales area.  The processed natural gas is sent to a glycol dehydration unit to remove water and other minor impurities to meet pipeline sales specifications.  Minor quantities of condensate, lubrication and processing oils are collected in a steel 500 barrel tank for sale.  The LPG is stored in two 30,000 gallon tanks and the gasoline is stored in two 24,500 gallon tanks.\n\nWorst Case release Scenario  \nThe worst case scenario involves a flammable mixture.  The case was modeled using EPA\u0012s RMP Comp\u0019 model.  The quantity released for this cas"

      "SummaryText": "e was assumed to be the entire storage capacity at the facility of 400,000 pounds.  Based on this quantity the distance to the endpoint of 1 psi was 0.60 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \nA minimum amount of product is stored at the facility.  Our practice is to not allow the LPG storage to get above 40,000 gallons or 67% of the total storage capacity and the gasoline storage to get above 49,000 gallons or 28% of the total storage capacity.\n\nEquipment maintenance and personnel training are the other elements of the prevention program.\n\nFive-year Accident History \nThere have been no accidental releases of LPG (propane/butane) nor gasoline at this facility in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program \nThe facility response program will be reviewed with company personnel.  The review will include drills to practice response , shut down, and notification procedures.  Response in the case of fire or clean up will be handled by the county agencies or third party contractors.  The annual meeting will be held with the county fire and law enforcement agencies to review the facility response procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nTraining will be conducted to include a review of incidents at other facilities to provide a basis for discussions on how to prevent potential incidents from occurring at this facility."
