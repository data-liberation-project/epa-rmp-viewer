ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\nAt this George's facility, we utilize anhydrous ammonia, and chlorine that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuble as a refrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Chlorine is a strong sanitizer but can be deadly if mishandled.  George's strives to protect all its valuble resources and assets-both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Butterfield Fire Departement and the Barry-Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the processing of chickens for use as refrigerated or frozen food.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing.  Chlorine is used in our water and wastewater processes.  There is chlorine kept in two areas at our facility.  An outside company is used to fill our main reciever tanks with ammonia, an outside company is also used to bring in our chlorine tanks as well.  Access to the site is restriced to facility workers, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 48,000 pounds.  There is 10,000 pounds of chlorin"

THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\nWorse Case Scenario (ammonia)\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of the largest reciever. The maximum quantity stored in this reciever is 14,210 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two-phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).  Distance to endpoint:1.6 miles\nAlternative Scenario (ammonia)\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of ammonia due to failure of a pressure relief valve.  The emergency valves shutdown release would engage and stop the flow and sound an alarm.  The monitoring system would alert personnel to manually shut the valve.  The maximum time of the release would be 60 minutes and maximum quantity released would be approximately 5,009 pounds of ammonia.  Distance to endpoint:  .5 miles\n\nWorst Case Scenario (Chlorine)\nThe worst case scenario would be to puncture the tank and loose all of the chlorine.  The maximum quantitiy stored in one tank is 2,000 pounds.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a two- phase flow (gas and aerosol-ALOHA).  Distance to endpoint: 5.1 miles\n\nAlternative Scenario (Chlorine)\nThe alternative scenario would be the release of chlorine due to the failure of a pressure relief valve.  The maximum time of release would be 60 minutes and the entire tank would be dispersed.\nDistance to endpoint:  1.2 miles\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nTo date, this George's facility has not incurred a reportable release.\n\n5.  THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nThe management of the RMP program will be handled by the comlex saftey officer.  He/She will administrate in conjunction with George's management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Barry County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Butterfield Fire Department.\n\n6.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL"

      "SummaryText": " RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nThis George's facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Our personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our written programs.  Our Refrigeration Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and On-the-job-training.  They are given oral tests and are observed so to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to the standard of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the most stringent standards of the industry.  The same standard applies to our wastewater technicians that handle the chlorine.  They are trained yearly and are tested and evaluated on the job.\n\n7.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\nGeorge's Inc., has onsite Hazardous Materials trained personnel to immediately respond to adverse conditions.  We have monthly meetings as well as annual certification.  This helps minimize the potential of an off-site release.  \nWe work very closley with the Barry County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Butterfield Fire Departement on emergency preparedness.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes  in the facility or any new concerns."
