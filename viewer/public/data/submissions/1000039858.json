The facility recently completed an expansion and can now treat approximately 12.5 million gallons per day.  Chlorine is used in the system for disinfection purposes and to generate chlorine dioxide.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE:\n\nThe 1-ton chlorine containers are stored in a newly constructed chemical storage building with forced air ventilation.  The containers are connected to the main header via whip lines.  The main header goes directly into pressure regulators/switchover mechanisms whereby the system goes under vacuum.  The room has a chlorine gas detection alarm system to warn of a chlorine gas leak as well as a ventilation system to draw fresh air in and force air out near the floor.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine is drawn by vacuum into the chlorinator room where it is mixed with water for process application.  Fresh air is forced into the chlorinator room, with exhaust air going out from the floor level.  The chlorinated water is injected into the process through Vaults 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAuthority policies include the need for a written emergency action plan, exercises and reviews of the plan, emergency response training for facility personnel, and coordination with local responders.  In addition, monthly safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Training Officer.  Risk management consultants from our insurance company are used as resources.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe chemical storage area is enclosed and equipped with the latest technology to contain and scrub any chemical releases. Plant personnel are trained to handle chemical containers in such a manner as to prevent leaks or spills while connecting or disconnecting containers.  Personnel are also trained to shut down the syst"

If the spill/release is beyond the capability of onsite personnel, the City of Taylor and Williamson County HAZMAT teams will respond by calling 911. Training and exercises are to be conducted periodically. The city and county have conducted a regional WMD terrorism exercise, which included the intentional release of hazardous chemicals. They conduct exercises related to hazardous chemical releases that Brazos River Authority personnel participate in.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWe completed joint training with local first responders and conducted additional internal HAZMAT and chemical safety training for operators, maintenance, and administrative personnel. Security enhancements and procedures have been made since 9-11 and continuous improvements are made as resources become available."
