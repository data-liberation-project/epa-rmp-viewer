High pressure liquid ammonia is circulated via exterior insulated pipelines to evaporator coils throughout the cold storage facility. Ammonia is vaporized in the evaporators and returned to the compressors. Ammonia vapor is first returned to the booster compressors, then pulled through the intercoolers by the high stage compressors, which discharge to the condensers. \n\nThe high-pressure vapor is then condensed to high pressure liquid ammonia by dispelling latent heat to the atmosphere. Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously. Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.

The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are involved in reviewing the PSM Program. Turkey Hill has an Emergency Action Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nThe Turkey Hill facility is located at 205 Spring Street, Searcy, AR. This facility provides refrigeration and freezing for food products. The process, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration and freezing for product. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.\nThe ammonia is circulated throughout the system using pressure differentials created by compressors and pumps. The pipes that carry the refrigerant are insulated for maintaining temperature"
