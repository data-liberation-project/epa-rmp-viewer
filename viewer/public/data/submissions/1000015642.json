With the exception of the valve stations on the roof, the majority of the ammonia is contained within the facility in a closed loop ammonia refrigeration system. The local fire department has been approached to handle emergency response until employees can be fully trained and a full staff is in place. The local fire department has had several walk through inspections and guided tours discussing the facility and been given a CD containing the emergency procedures for the system, P&IDs, and Equipment layout. Procedure training has been discussed with the fire department and we have agreed to provide tours and training sessions to all three shifts of the local FD. Operating procedures were written by a RETA-ANSI Certified Industrial Refrigeration Operator and trained by RETA Authorized Instructor. Ammonia is being placed in the system, then started up in sections, and the fully operational by end of October. At this time only 2/3rds of the charge is being added and remainder will be added near the end of September.  Update of the RMP with actual inventories will be provided within 6 weeks as the total charge should be installed. This system has 4 levels of overpressure protection, ammonia detectors that shut off the power in the engine room 150 times prior to the LEL, and a control system that alarms operators of any rising abnormalities.  The two schools located within the toxic endpoint, one is due west of the facility and highly unlikely to have wind blowing that direction. Saginaw High School is right at the end of our toxic endpoint due north of the facility. Prevailing winds during cold wet months are from the north which would most likely be the only way to reach the school with large amounts of ammonia.  We have discussed the need for shelter in place for the school and residences with the fire departments. The facility is constr"
