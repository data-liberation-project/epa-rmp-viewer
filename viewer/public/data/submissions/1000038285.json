The chemical accident prevention provisions require an executive summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) submission to EPA. Per 40 CFR 68.155, the owner or operator shall provide in the RMP an executive summary that includes a brief description of the following elements:\n\n(a) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\n(b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n(c) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\n\n(d) The five-year accident history;\n\n(e) The emergency response program; and\n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage, and it is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is KF's policy to notify Hahnville Volunteer Fire Department, St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center (EOC), St. Charles Parish Sheriff,and Louisiana State Police.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Taft terminal recieves anhydrous ammonia by ship and barge and stores it in two cryogenic storage tanks (50,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia per tank) and one pressurized bullet tank (156 tons) until it is either (a) loaded onto a ship or barge or (b) injected into a third-party pipeline for further transport or distribution.  The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 200,312,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance stored at the Facility in amounts above threshold quantity.  The Facility is su"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\n\n\nSome release preventive features at the Facility include\n\n- Emergency shutdown buttons at the barge and ship loading area and multiple locations throughout the terminal that can be activated by KF personnel or the ship/barge crew in case of an ammonia release.\n\n- Surge bladders on the ship/barge loading lines to absorb the shock during a sudden closure of the valve due to emergency shutdown.\n\n- A firewater deluge system on top of the cryogenic ammonia tanks.\n\n- Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn June 19, 2009, a KF employee was exposed to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia on his legs.  The employee was taken to a local emergency room, treated for exposure, and released the same day.  Approximately 80 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released from a block valve during a maintenance operation.  The cause of the release was human error and improper procedure, and, as a result, KF updated its procedures.  This release was reported to regulatory agencies.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the anhydrous ammonia system, it is the facility's policy to notify the Louisiana State Police and St. Charles Parish EOC and request response.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protect"
