It also has training sessions for all employees engaged in the transfer of product and the repair of this facility.\n\nWe feel that through careful inspection and maintenace with trained employees we can prevent nearly all accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at this plant.  This plant is engaged in the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonis to be used as a nitrogen fertilizer.  \n\nThe worst case release would be the rupture of our largest vessel, a 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing approximately 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Using RMP Comp.as a model, this would give a toxic endpoint of 6.9 miles possibly affecting 4268 people depeding on weed speed and direction.\n\nOne alternative release, again using RMP Comp., would be the rupture of piping results from a transport driving away before disconnecting the delivery hose.  This release would last approximately 10 minutes resulting in the release of approximately 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of 2.2 miles and possibly affecting 970 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nAnother alternative release would be the rupture of a hose at the loading riser.  This would result in the release of approximately 266 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of approximately 0.8 miles and possible affecting 154 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nBoth alternative releases should be stopped by automatic excess flow valves installed in the piping system.\n\nConsumers Oil Company is regulated by the Missouri Department of Agriculture and also conducts its own inspections of plant, tanks, piping, and hoses used in the transferand storage of anhydrous ammonia.  All employees involved in the storage, transfer, and repair of the facilities are also trained in the proper and safe handling"

If available personnel cannot either quickly or safely handle the situation they should immediately leave the area and contact local emergency responders (911).\n\nConsumers Oil Company plans to continue good maintenance of the facility and on going training of all employees."
