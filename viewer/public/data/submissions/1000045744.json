We resolve all findings from our reviews of proposed changes to facilities, equipment, and operations and from analyses of process hazards. Some findings of this type can result in modifications to the process. the prevention program, or administrative controls.

The chlorine process is classified as a Program Level 3 process, and we implement a complete accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nWe performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of chlorine from our facility as a regulated toxic substance that could affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consisted of evaluating both a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) following identification of the appropriate ARS. We do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility similar to our water treatment plant. ARSA\u00bfs can be used to help the Lewis/Upshur (local) Emergency Planning Committee (L/UEPC) improve and prepare an effective community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nWe have submitted release scenario analyses to EPA and have shared that information with L/UEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to local residents, schools, hospitals, and businesses.

In this scenario, the chlorine is released as a vaporizing liquid inside a completely enclosed chlorine storage room in our water treatment building. The containment provided by the building mitigates the release. Such building confinement reduces the release rate of chlorine vapor directly to the outdoors. Since this facility is located in a semi-populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach off-site end points and nearby public receptors.\r\n\r\nA sump is provided to collect and contain portions of a liquid release that do not immediately vaporize. In reality, the sump could serve to reduce the vaporization rate of chlorine to the storage room air, and likewise reduce the rate at which chlorine gas is released from the room directly to the outside air. However, because we based our analysis on a very conservative approach, we did not take credit for the sump as a form of mitigation in reducing the endpoint distance\treached off-site.\r\n\r\nNumerous administrative controls are in place to prevent a release of this type and should one occur, to provide for effective emergency response.
