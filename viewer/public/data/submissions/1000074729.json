This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSimmons Feed Ingredients facility in Milan, Missouri has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The Milan facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented a HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team).  As part of this emergency response program, we emphasize a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, Milan has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at the Simmons facility ensures that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Milan Fire Department in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nSimmons Feed Ingredients is a producer of frozen dog food products, specifically chicken, turkey, and pork products.  The NAICS codes for these processes at this facility are 311615.   \r\n\r\nSimmons has one"

      "SummaryText": "regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The Simmons Feed Ingredients plant has one ammonia refrigeration process for the preservation of the food products.  The quantity of ammonia stored at the plant is approximately 25,000 pounds.  \r\n \r\n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.\r\n\r\nAmmonia \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\r\n\r\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\r\n\r\n1.\tCorrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\r\n2.\tFreezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nSimmons has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration systems. At Simmons, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSH"

      "SummaryText": "A PSM program.  Thus, Simmons ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe ammonia PSM program at Simmons includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system. The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA - what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (HAZWOPER plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n2.\tSimmons has researched information pertaining to the properties and hazards of ammonia, sought professional assistance from experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, and used many internal resources to develop a reference manual.  Block flow diagrams and P&IDs have been developed and are updated as the ammonia refrigeration system audits are completed.\r\n\r\n3.\tSimmons has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees)  responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\r\n\r\n4.\tIn the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have resulted in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\r\n\r\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe review of Simmons accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 and December 11, 2018.  According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\r\n\r\n6.0\tEMERG"

The sections of the response document contain detailed information on emergency phone numbers, notification procedures, contacting emergency personnel, incident command structure, hazardous material releases, evacuation and relocation procedures, and emergency health services.\r\n\r\nSimmons emergency response plan (HAZWOPER) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Milan Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Milan Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSimmons has an on-going Action Item Tracking system for all findings and recommendations from Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's), Mechanical Integrity Inspections, Compliance Audits, etc that is reviewed and updated periodically throughout through PSM Team meetings."
