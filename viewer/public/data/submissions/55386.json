      "SummaryText": "\nThe Okmulgee Water Treatment Plant stores chlorine on-site to provide a means of disinfecting treated water. The maximum quantity on-hand exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68. \n\nThe Okmulgee WTP is devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe Okmulgee WTP supplies drinking water to its customers and rural water districts. The process itself is capable of treating up to 8 mgd. Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before distribution and to maintain chlorine residual to protect the water quality. The chlorine supply is pulled from the ton container under a vacuum. The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere because of piping failure. This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, which eliminates all pressure piping in the system. At the chlorinator, the gas is converted to a solution, thereby minimizing any potential hazards.\n\nThe impact areas for both the worst case and alternate release scenarios were based on the EPA's Appendix F: Supplemental RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables. The worst case release scenario considered a one-ton release within a 10-minute period. This resulted in a 1.3 mile radius impact area, with an estimated population of 302 persons based on 2000 census population density for Okmulgee County. Environmental receptors within distance to endpoint include a designated Wildlife refuge. No passive mitigation has been considered.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was based on a gas release created by a rust hole in the one-ton container since the rest of the system operates either under a vacuum or in a solution. A ?\" diameter hole in the container resulted in a release rate of 150 lbs/min of Cl2. The impact area of this release was determined by exhibit F-12 to have a radius of 0.2 miles. The only receptors involved"

No passive mitigation has been considered.\n\nThe chlorine system components at the plant comply with one or more of the following standards: NFPA 58, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards. However, consistent maintenance and regular training sessions will minimize the potential for a toxic release.\n\nThe Okmulgee WTP has not had any accidental chemical releases within the last five years. If a release were to occur, then the chlorine gas detectors would notify plant personnel of the presence of chlorine gas. Plant personnel would then contact the Okmulgee Fire Department at (918)756-1313. Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required. The fire department  are trained first responders and would take control of the situation to minimize the impact of the release as drilled in accordance with the emergency response procedures manual.\n\nThe chemical feed system in place at the plant was installed in 1996 and last modified in 2008 and is in good working condition. At this time, no modifications are planned.\n"
