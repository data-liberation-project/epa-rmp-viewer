It specifically applies to GLWA's use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. This program continues GLWA's commitment to the protection of its neighbors and its employees and the control of the potential for such a release. No such release has ever occurred at the plant that is the subject of this Program.\n\n(a) Program Summary\nThe program described herein supplements the procedures described in other GLWA documents such as general administrative guidelines and safety and heath manuals. The RMP/PSM program addresses PSM and RMP program requirements for management procedures, employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analyses, operating procedures, training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigation, mechanical integrity, contractor management, hot work, emergency planning and response and compliance audits, and other risk management plan requirements. Each topic has its own section in this program document, with management elements of the program contained in Section 15 of Subpart A: General.\nProcess safety information describing the hazards and physical properties of chlorine, safe operating limits, and descriptions of the major process equipment are included in Subpart D: Prevention Program.\n\n(b) Organization of Document\nThis RMP/PSM program document is organized in sections, with each section covering a primary element of the RMP/PSM process. The sections appear in the same order as their topics appear in the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rule, with same section number.\n\nAll tables and figures are included at the end of each section. In addition, various appended exhibits (forms, policies, technical information, etc.) are at the end of each s"
