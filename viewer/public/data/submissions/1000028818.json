The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.

To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nOzburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Ozburn Hessey Logistics, LLC - Fond Du Lac Facility employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls.\n\n"
