If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local and county fire departments to minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nOur primary activity at Mountain View Co-op - Power is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored and handled would be 175,000 pounds in our 25 1400 gallon nurse tanks..\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is in compliance with OSHA's standard on \"Storing and Handling Anhydrous Ammonia\"\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental ddamage.\n\nOur emergency response program is provided to the state and county under the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required undera SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Mountain View Co-op.
