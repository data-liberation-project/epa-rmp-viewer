This pursuant to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulations contained in Part 68 of Code 40 of the federal regulations (40 CFR Part 68), Accidental Release Prevention regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention regulation requires stationary sources with listed substances present in quantities greater than the corresponding threshold quantity to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The risk management program is to be described in a Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is registered with the USEPA, submitted to the state and local agencies, and made available to the public.  At General Chemical Augusta Plant, one listed chemical, Oleum, is managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThis RMP was prepared in accordance with 40 CFR 68, Subpart G (68. 105-68.190), which provides a format for a written RMP.  In accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.10(d)(2), the NAICS 325188 (former SIC classification 2819) requires compliance with this rule.\n\n\n\nAn updated RMP, including an off-site consequence analysis, is required within five years of the RMP's initial submission or its most recent update.  A compliance audit to certify compliance with the provisions of the RMP regulations is required every three years.\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment was completed consisting of one worst-case release scenario and one alternative case release scenario.  The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR part 68 Subpart B (68.20-68.42), as well as guidance provided by USEPA's Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance Document.\n\n\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAs part of General Chemical, the Augusta Plant is committed to being a respons"

General Chemical Corporate Policy dictates that facilities minimize the potential for adverse effects to the environment as well as to the health of employees and local citizens by operating plants safely.  Methods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely are encouraged.  A key element of the General Chemical Health, Safety and Environmental Policy is fostering openness through dialogue with employees and the public.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We pay close attention to those chemicals which OSHA and the EPA identify as hazardous substances.  Our policy is to conform to all applicable laws and regulations, as well as codes and recommended practices to ensure the safety of the public and the environment.  We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely.  We also prepared for potential emergencies to protect employees and the public in the event of a chemical release.\n\n\n\nThe standard operating procedures were reviewed and found to be accurate and up-to-date.  \n\n\n\nSafety is an important issue at the Augusta Plant.  Monthly meetings are held with plant employees to address environmental and safety issues.  The plant participates in a quarterly meeting with other local industry and the public to review safety issues.  The plant also has regular audits, which are conducted by internal employees and corporate audit teams.  The recommendations obtained through these audits are used to improve the environmental health and safety status at the Augusta Plant.   Procedures on actions to be taken upon physical exposure to an RMP chemical and/or if airborne exposure occurs is detailed in the standard operating procedures\n\n\n\nThe Augusta Sulfuric Acid Plant is a state of the art plant, which was designed and built by Monsanto Envirochem.  The initial start-up was September 15, 1997.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stat"

      "SummaryText": "ionary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nAt this facility, sulfur is burned to form sulfur dioxide, which is oxidized in a catalytic converter to form sulfur trioxide.  The sulfur trioxide is then hydrated to sulfuric acid and Oleum in absorption towers.  Oleum is produced through the absorption of sulfur trioxide enters the Oleum tower in a counter-current flow to the circulating Oleum where it is absorbed into solution.  The product is 24% and 35% Oleum.  Oleum is transferred off-site via pipeline to a neighboring chemical company.  The Oleum inventory on site is 14,400,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.0 Key Off-site Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n3.1    Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Oleum is the failure of a storage tank containing 2,000,000 pounds of 35% Oleum.  Secondary containment is considered in this scenario which has a surface area of 8,234 square feet.  The scenario assumes all Oleum in the storage unit would be spilled into the secondary containment area in 10 minutes.  The estimated distance to the toxic end point of 0.010 mg/l was calculated to be 4.3 miles based on a release rate of 62.4 pounds per minute.  The physical parameters of the Oleum are as follows: 35%, 108 (F and 27 mmHg.  The calculation was performed using the EPA's Off-site Consequence Guidance Document (equation D-1 for toxic liquids was used which allows for the use of a specific temperature and vapor pressure).  The conditions defined by the EPA for modeling the worst-case scenario are: 1.5 m/s wind speed, F stability and an air temperature of 77(F.  The topography is urban.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nWe maintain a significant safety program to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe opera"

According for reporting accidents, no accidents have occurred during the past five years involving the release of a chemical regulated under Risk Management program causing on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage; or known off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelter in place.\n\n\n\nHowever, an incident did occur at our site on November 17, 1998, which caused 46 people in the local community to seek medical attention.  No injuries were reported from plant employees.  The incident occurred during the course of start-up of our Sulfuric Acid plant when some cooling equipment was not properly engaged.  This caused the release of approximately seven pounds of Sulfur Trioxide and 78 pounds of Sulfuric Acid mist through our stack during a 10-minute period.  Both of these quantities are below the reportable quantity identified by the EPA that triggers release reporting.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this release, a complete incident investigation was performed.  This included a detailed process hazard analysis to identify the root cause of the release.  Process control methods to control future incidents were installed as a "
