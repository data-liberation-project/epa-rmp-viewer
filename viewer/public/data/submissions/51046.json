(PDI) is committed to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner and being a responsible member of the community by making safety information available to the community.  Safety is a top priority at PDI as reflected in its proactive planning, state-of-the-art equipment, employee training, and its coordination with Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS) to prevent accidental releases from occurring and instituting controls to rapidly mitigate a potential release if it does occur.  Risk management planning has been initiated from the facility's inception.  The Praxair Operational Safety Manual requires that an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) be developed and implemented at each Praxair distribution facility in accordance with Policy 1.08, ?Emergency Preparedness and Response?. The ERP was originally prepared in 2003 and last updated on 7/27/07 and must be reviewed and updated at least annually.  The ERP includes a list of hazardous materials onsite, an evacuation plan and employee responsibilities in case of emergency. \n\nFacility Description:\n\nPDI specializes in the distribution of industrial and medical gases (NAICS Code 422690, SIC Code 5169).  The PDI facility at 1930 Loveridge Road, Pittsburg, California (Figure 1) is a compressed gas distribution center operating since February 2003.  The plant, occupying approximately 6.3 acres, is a state-of-the art facility constructed in 2002. PDI places a high priority on safety and has had no chemical accidents or releases with offsite consequences in the last five years. Access to the manufacturing and office building is strictly controlled through a chain link fence and a security alarm system. The plant is located off Loveridge Road and California Avenue in Pittsburg near Highway 4.  The surrounding area is used for industrial manufacturing and commercial warehousing activities.  The nearest body of water is the San Joaquin Ri"
