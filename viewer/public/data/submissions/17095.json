The owners, managment and employees of the scranton equity exchange are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   Health, safety and environmental compliance are fundamental part of every employees job.  It is facility policy to adhere to applicable federal, state and local laws, and to implement approprate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur,  the faclity would respond in accordance with its emergency response plan, and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the emergency planning committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment, and the general public.     STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  the primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of NH3 for direct sales to farmers. The maximum storage is stated within this plan.  The maximum fill levels of the tanks are eighty five percent of the listed tank capacity - which is controlled by a liquid level guage.  THE WORST CASE SCENERIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENERIO: the worse case scenerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a short period of time.  The maximum quantity relase would be one hundred percent of the listed tanks stated.  The distance to the end point would be 4.4 miles.  The alternate release scenerio would involve the rupture of a NH3 hose during transfer of product from storage tank to a nurse tank.  The quantity released as a gas would be approximately 95 pounds.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM: The facility complies with the EPA's accidental release requirements and applicable state and local codes and requlations.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the previous five years that have caused any deaths, inju"
