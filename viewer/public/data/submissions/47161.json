      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n \nThe Yuma Desalting Plant uses chlorine as a necessary part of the water treatment process.   Storing a large quantity of chlorine can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  The Yuma Desalting Plant is owned and operated by the Bureau of Reclamation.  As such, it takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps the Bureau of Reclamation takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation recognizes the responsibility to make its environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns.  The Bureau of Reclamation is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  The Bureau of Reclamation is dedicated to developing an environmentally responsible energy resource compatible with community needs.   The prevention of accidents and protection of its employees, property and the general public are essential to the efficient and successful completion of every project undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Reclamation requires active injury and illness prevention as an important element of production on a daily basis.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Ai"

This document summarizes the Bureau of Reclamation?s existing health and safety programs, its internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Yuma Desalting Plant Authority has prepared an emergency action plan (called the Continuity of Operations Plan) to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant is located at 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona in the southwest corner of Arizona near the California and Mexico borders.  The YDP is located in the northwest quarter of Yuma, immediately south of Cocopah R.V. and Golf Resort and adjacent to the Arizona Public Service Yucca Power Plant.\n\nThe WQIC and production plant use the chlorine systems to provide a chlorine solution as a disinfecting agent.  This disinfecting step is necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at Yuma Desalting Plant exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.  The anhydrous chlorine process is a Program 3 process.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nYuma Desalting Plant is in compliance with federal Process Safety Management requirements. Yuma Desalting Plant?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nDetailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\nComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nComprehensive preventive maintenance program.\nPerformance of process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and re"

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nDetails such as maximum intended inventory and safe upper and lower operating limits are on file at the facility.  The Bureau of Reclamation also has procedures in place that is triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nThe chlorine process is equipped with a number of safety features designed to prevent accidental releases.  Such safety devices include secondary containment, leak detectors and alarms, pressure and level indication, and emergency eye-wash and shower.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 2006, a detailed process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted for chlorine system equipment and procedures.  The PHA will be updated within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions was developed during the 2006 PHA to improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating and implementing these recommendations, as appropriate.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation maintains written operating procedures that provide cle"

Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nYuma Desalting Plant employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process are trained in an overview of the process and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures. The Bureau of Reclamation ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.  Yuma Desalting Plant training program includes as a minimum the following elements: (1) process safety information (2) process technology and process equipment, including safety systems, (3) maintenance procedures, and (4) operating procedures for the chlorine system.\n\nEach employee (presently involved in operating the chlorine process) has been trained to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities, including emergency actions.  \n\nRefresher training is provided annually to each employee operating the covered process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change as indicated in their management of change procedures.\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, provides certification of the records, which includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the signature of the person (s) administering the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety progra"

These procedures ensure that no new/significantly modified process will start-up and no regulated substances will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. \n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation uses a manual system that assures inspection, testing, and maintenance of chlorine equipment in accordance with the manufacturer and industry groups.\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation requires employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing ?hot work? in, on, or around the covered process.  The Bureau of Reclamation uses a permitting program to ensure hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.
