If an emergency were to occur, it is KNCs policy to notify Murdock Fire Department or the Swift County Sheriffs Office.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: The Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC - Murdock Ammonia Terminal stores anhydrous ammonia in and distributes it from one refrigerated cylinder tank (60,000,000 pounds), and two 90,000-gallon bullet tanks (394,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia per tank). The total storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is 60,788,000 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: The facility complies with EPAs chemical accident prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and applicable state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.111 and relevant American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards.\n\nFive-year accident history: One accidental release which resulted in an onsite injury has occurred over the past five years.  The release did not result in deaths, significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, required sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  \n\nOn October 29, 2010, a KNC employee, while performing maintenance on a valve, was exposed to ammonia trapped in the valve.  The employee was exposed to vapor and liquid ammonia on his upper body (face and arms).  The employee went immediately to the safety shower and was taken to a local emergency room, treated for exposure, and released the next day.  Approximately 1 pound of anhydrous ammonia was released from the valve during this maintenance operation.  The cause of the release was human error, as a re"
