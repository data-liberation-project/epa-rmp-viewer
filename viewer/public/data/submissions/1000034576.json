We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nWe are a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care Program.  The ACC Responsible Care Program goes beyond the boundaries of regulatory compliance and strives for continuous improvement in industry operations and processes by incorporating health, safety, and environmental protection into all stages of a products life; design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, use, recycling, and disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Orange plant participates in the Orange Community Advisory Panel of local citizens who meet regularly with plant management to discuss various issues, especially those related to environmental, safety, and health.  This mechanism was established to better understand and address the needs and concerns of the local community.\r\n\r\nSolvay has been proactive in communicating our risk management program with the community.  A RMP Community Awareness event was in public meetings during April of 1998 and included participation by local industry and the local emergency response community.  The Community Advisory Panel toured our plant and employees and management were available to answer questions.  Information was distributed that explains our plant's safety programs, release scenarios, and emergency response program.  The presentation to the general public was repeated during the community's annual Gumbo Cook-Off Festival on May 2,1998.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from the Solvay Corporate Safety Policy:\r\n\r\nConsistent with the policy of the Global Business Unit Solvay"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: A variety of technical documents are kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  A comprehensive program ensures that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process or process change is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is performed by a team, which identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when deemed necessary.\r\nStandard Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures p"

The written procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, emergency shutdown procedures, and safety and health considerations.\r\nTraining:   We have established a comprehensive training program to certify operators in both unit operations and emergency response procedures.  This requires operators to demonstrate (through written testing and hands-on examinations) that they have adequate knowledge before they can work independently.  This training includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.  There is refresher training for all operators on the operating procedures and chemical hazards of the process.\r\nMechanical Integrity:  An established preventive maintenance and equipment integrity program promotes that all process equipment is operating within approved limits.  The initial and on-going integrity of process equipment is ensured by determining that the equipment is designed, installed and maintained properly.  This includes testing and inspection of equipment and quality assurance checks of equipment, spare parts and maintenance materials.  Any deficiencies, which are found, are required to be corrected before the equipment is returned to service.\r\nManagement of Change: A compliance program ensures that changes to equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), and operating procedures are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage the change and that existing controls have not been compromised by the modification.
