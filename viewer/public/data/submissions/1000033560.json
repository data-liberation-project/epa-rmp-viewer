(AE) owns and operates a nameplate 110,000,000 gallon per year (110 MMgal/yr) denatured fuel-grade ethanol and industrial grade undenatured ethanol plant. The plant is permitted to produce up to 150 MMgal/yr of final product. Plant construction began in July 2006 and operations began in February 2008. At that time, AE submitted an RMP for the facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. \r\n\r\nThe AE ethanol plant utilizes corn (grain) to produce ethanol via natural fermentation. These activities fall under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2869, Industrial Organic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified. The plant generates fuel-grade ethanol, primarily for blending with motor fuels. The ethanol may be blended with approximately 2.5% gasoline in the final denaturing stages of the process or it may be left undenatured. The plant also generates carbon dioxide, corn oil, and dried, modified wet, and wet distiller's grain and solubles (DDGS/MWDGS/ WDGS), which can be sold as animal feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\n\r\nAE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by AE's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident prevention. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility.\r\n\r\nIt is AE policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. AE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nAE is located approximately 0.6 miles south of Lyle, MN"

The facility is located south of the state line between St. Ansgar, Iowa and Lyle, Mower County Minnesota. \r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The only substance which AE has onsite that is regulated by the RMP program is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process. It is stored in a single anhydrous ammonia tank. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAE has been subject to RMP criteria since it began storing anhydrous ammonia onsite.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, AE has had no reportable accidents.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nAE is registered with the Mason City, IA LEPC and therefore does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, AE would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support.\r\n \r\nAs explained above, AE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel would respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, a manual shut off valve on the ammonia tank would help limit the volume of an ammonia spill. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nAE is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  AE is fulfilling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP and similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  AE has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry a"

Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  In addition, the anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve, which minimizes the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, AE is committed to protecting its employees, the greater community and the environment from the release of hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. AE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production facility in a safe and efficient manner. Periodic audits will help us assure that we are doing everything reasonable to minimize the risk of and mitigate the effects of an accidental release."
