This is accomplished by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Arch evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\n\tPre-Startup Reviews (PSSR)\r\nPSSR are conducted for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\n\tMechanical Integrity\r\nArch has established procedures and practices to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

The results and findings from these updates are documented, tracked and retained.  Once again, team findings are converted to action items and other projects for implementing the team's suggestions.\r\n\r\n\tOperating Procedures\r\nArch maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The Management of Change process ensures operating procedures are updated as process changes are made.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Arch maintains key process parameter documents that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n\tTraining\r\nTo complement the written operating procedures, Arch has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees undergo a computer based training session. After successfully completing this training, the new employee undergoes an on-the-job training segment where the employee must demonstrate competency in certain job related skills.
