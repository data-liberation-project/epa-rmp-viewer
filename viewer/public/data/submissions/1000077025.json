Everyone is responsible to recognize and communicate risks.\n\n- Zero injuries, occupational illnesses and indents; all are preventable.\n\n- All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\n\n\n\nThe Corporate policies are embodied in the numerous Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At the Pontchartrain Site, the policies are implemented through the Pontchartrain Site Process Safety Management Manual.  Other manuals and standards that also reinforce policies are the Pontchartrain Works Standards, Environmental Manual, Occupational Health Manual, HAZCOM Manual, and Safety Manual.  The manuals and standard are available to all employees through computer network.  In addition, the Pontchartrain Site Emergency Plan lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Site consists of 1132 acres, located in St John the Baptist Parish between the unincorporated areas of LaPlace and Reserve.  About 200 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 590 acres are leased for cattle grazing, 30 acres are leased for recreation, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.  A portion of the area used for manufacturing is occupied by Denka Performance Elastomer.  The Denka Performance Elastomer facility is considered to be a separate \"stationary source\" for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\n\n\nIn and prior to 2010, the DuPont Pontchartrain Site consisted of two manufacturing processes:  \n\n\n\n*  Paraphenylene Diamine\n\n*  Isophorone Diamine\n\n\n\nThe Isophorone Diamine Unit was cleared of process material and shutdown on 10/7/2010.
