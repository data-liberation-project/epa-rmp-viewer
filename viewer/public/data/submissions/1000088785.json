      "SummaryText": "Delaware River Partners LLC\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nDelaware River Partners LLC (DRP) owns and operates the DRP Gibbstown Logistics Center in Gloucester County, New Jersey.  The site was formerly owned by DuPont and operated as an explosives and chemical manufacturing facility from approximately 1890 to 1980.  Chemours became the owner of record of the site in April 2015 and DRP acquired the site in June 2016. The site is being redeveloped into a multi-modal deep-water seaport by DRP. The site features an existing underground cavern that was previously mined out of metamorphic rock in approximately 1965. The cavern was previously used by DuPont for the storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n \n\nCavern storage and loading areas are located near the Delaware River, at the north of the site and about one mile from the site entrance.  The cavern has been refurbished to receive, store, and distribute Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), specifically refinery-grade butane.  The cavern is located between 340 and 370 feet below the ground surface and has a storage capacity of approximately 7.8 million gallons (1 million cubic feet). The cavern and loading facilities were approved by the NJDEP for operation under the TCPA Risk Management Program, signed and dated 6/22/2017. A Major Modification to this approved RMP includes the addition of propane to the facility registration, additional rail car and truck transloading operations (landside) and the addition of a deep water port, constructed according to recommended industry specifications and operation under the jurisdiction of the USCG.  \n\n  \n\nLPG is a flammable substance and can be present as a liquid or a vapor (gas). The DRP transloading facility is designed in accordance with modern safety standards. The design, construction and operation includes all applicable codes and standards and industry best practices to prevent impact to human health and the environment.  \n\n\n\n1.     The design of the transloading facili"

International Code Council (ICC), which includes International Fire Code (IFC)\n\n?    American Petroleum Institute (API)\n\n?    American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)\n\n\n\n2.    The transloading facility design includes redundant gas monitors, pressure relief valves, alarms and interlocks to protect the system and automatic emergency shut-down systems.  In addition, an enclosed emergency flare system has been installed to collect and safely destroy flammable gas in case of an emergency. \n\n\n\n3.    The transloading system is subject to significant safety regulation, including construction approval and oversight by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA).  The TCPA program incorporates all the elements of the the USEPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). \n\n\n\n4.    Transportation of LPG into and out of the site by truck or railcar is highly regulated by the US Department of Transportation (DOT). DRP is also a registered member of CHEMTREC, who is a leader in 24 hour Emergency Response and incident management.\n\n\n\n5.    DRP conducts annual emergency preparedness exercise with local and county emergency responders.  The local volunteer department is supported by the Gloucester County Department of Emergency Response which includes 911 dispatch, fire and emergency medical services, and a hazardous materials response team.\n\n\n\n6.    In addition to the design, prevention, and emergency response elements discussed above, the safety management program for the LPG Transloading Facility operation includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - A PHA has been conducted and documented for engineering design. An Inherently Safer Technology (IST) review and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOP"

Process Safety Information - A Safety Review of Design Report has been prepared for the design and includes process safety information, process flow diagrams, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and other details for the safe design, construction, and operation of the system. \n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) - SOPs have been developed based on the engineering design.  The SOPs were updated and implemented prior to start-up of the system, and are reviewed and certified annually as accurate and complete by Operations.. \n\n?    Hazard Review and Offsite Consequence Analysis - Worst-case and alternative case release scenarios were developed to assess the potential for offsite impact and support the PHA. There are no credible scenarios the have an offsite impact, and offsite receptors as defined in 40 CFR 68.30 and 68.33, are not present in the release distance to the endpoint.\n\n?    Pre-startup safety review (PSSR) - A PSSR was conducted prior to the startup of the original facility to verify installation and operation according to design and is included in the tasks required prior to start up of additional transloading facilities.\n\n?    Training and Employee Participation - Hazards have been communicated to all employees and contractors, and training has been conducted on the safe operation of the system.  Employees and contractors actively participate in the annual facility emergency response drills. In addition, employees have been trained in the facility emergency action plan and included in the development of the PHA, SOPs, and other procedures.\n\n?    Contractor Safety - Contractors are pre-qualified and subjected to safety assessments.\n\n?    Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity - The cavern has undergone integrity and pressure testing, and the transloading system will be inspected for quality, specifications and performance during the PSSR prior to start up.

DRP has an Emergency Action Plan that activates the local LEPC, Gibbstown Volunteer Fire Department, through the  911 system. Activation of the County Emergency Responders would be at the discretion of the local LEPC.  Emergency response drills include the local emergency responders and ensure that responsible personnel at DRP are current with appropriate procedures and responses to emergency situations.\n\n\n\nDRP is committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.
