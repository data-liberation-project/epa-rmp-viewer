              "Description": "The Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Systems of WWTP is subject to comply with EPA Prevention Program 3.  This is based on the worst case release scenario analysis results from both the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Systems being subject to OSHA?s PSM rule, 29 CFR 1910.119 and  EPA?s RMP 40-CFR-68.  The City of Frederick accidental releaseprevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and it is in compliance with all applicable EPA and OSHA Prevention Program requirements.  This section describes the EPA and OSHA requirements the City has fulfilled as operator of our Frederick WWTP. The plan also includes the prevention steps taken beyond this regulatory requirement.  The City of Frederick?s WWTP?s Document Management System (DMS) contains in it the key OSHA/EPA document which details the operation of the prevention program.\nThe City of Frederick accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA PSM program and EPA RMP Level 3 prevention program (described above in section 1.1.2).  The plant has an emergency response program, which is coordinated (reviewed by) with the City of Frederick Fire Department, which is a member of Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) along with Fort Detrick?s HazMat Team.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.  To ensure the public?s safety evacuation may be required during a major release.  Evacuation will begin with a minimum of 1.3 mile radius from the source.  The incident commander is advised to evacuate up to 4 miles radius based on the circumstances of the catastrophic release.  This is three times the distance recommended by the EPA Guidance.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Frederick plant by the following:\nHigh level of involvement in every aspect of the chlorine system operations including participation in : \n?    Safety committee \n?    Chlorine PSM/RMP safety teams, \n?    Development of the operation procedures, \n?    Hazard evaluations,\n?    Process Hazards Analysis, and\n?    on-going training of the operators and other involved staff.\nPreventive maintenance and mechanical integrity programs ensure the safe operation of the equipment and systems.\nUse of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment that meets and/or  exceeds industry and regulatory standards.\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures written with the participation of the operators.  These documents are all controlled by City of Frederick WWTP DMS document control system.\nManagement of all changes to the procedures, equipment and chemicals used by the City of Frederick on the site.  Again, the DMS document control system is key to the high quality of the operation and its products.\nPerformance of a hazard review of equipment, plant, and procedures\nImplementation of an audit and inspection program.\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include:  1).  the chlorine/sulfur dioxide building ventilation systems, 2).  chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors, 3).  Use of full face chlorine canister respirator worn by the operators during connection and disconnection of either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide ton containers, 4).  the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in the event of a HHC leak, 5).  employee training in operations and maintenance with emphasis on awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, 6).  Participation of the Frederick-Risk Coordinator and Fire department in site safety evaluations.\nThe City of Frederick has in use: policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program addresses each of  the EPA Program level 3 listed 12 elements, plus  RMP elements and OSHA rules needed to implement the program, and similar elements in place in the plants? OSHA PSM program.  These are maintained in the City of Frederick WWTP DMS document control system under the Key Document listed below:\nElement Title    EPA 68 #    OSHA 1910-119 #\n?    Management System    15    (a&e)\n?    Process safety information    65    ( d )\n?    Process hazard analysis    67    ( e )\n?    Operating procedures    69    ( f )\n?    Training    71    ( g )\n?    Mechanical integrity    73    ( j )\n?    Management of change    75    ( l )\n?    Pre-startup review    77    ( i )\n?    Compliance audits    79    ( o )\n?    Incident investigation    81    ( m )\n?    Employee participation    83    ( c )\n?    Hot work permit    85    ( k )\n?    Contractors    87    ( h )\n?    Emergency Response    95    (n)\n?    Trade Secrets    N/A    ( p )\nThe OSHA PSM elements which are like the RMP elements (above) of the response plan have been in place.  The program is tailored to the City of Frederick Water Plant #1 and to the emergency response services available in the Frederick, Maryland community.  Finally, the plant is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements as well as Maryland Vulnerability",

Wastewater from the City and\nnearby Walkersville, Maryland is received and treated at the\nfacility.  The Walkersville, Maryland wastewater is treated\nwith a minimal amount of chlorine and subsequently directed\nto the wastewater treatment plant for Frederick County\n(Ballenger Creek WWTP).  The City wastewater is treated\nthrough a series of settling basins, clarifiers, sand\nfilters, chemical treatments and post-aeration before being\ndischarged to the Monocacy River.  Based on an assessment of\nthe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems used at the facility\n(chlorine storage greater than 2,500 pounds and sulfur\ndioxide storage greater than 5,000 pounds), the WWTP is\nrequired under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n(CFR) Part 68 and the United States Environmental Protection\nAgency (USEPA) to develop and implement a Risk Management\nPlan (RMPlan).  The chlorine treatment system consists of\neight (8) 1-ton containers (four (4) in use, four (4) as\nbackup).  Similarly, the sulfur dioxide treatment system\nconsists of six (6) 1-ton containers (three (3) in use,\nthree (3) as backup).  The City operates the chemical\ntreatment systems in accordance with standard industry\npractices and monitors the performance of each system on a\nregular basis.  The safety of all WWTP operations are\ncontinually reviewed and improved through an internal safety\ncommittee that meets at a minimum on a quarterly basis.  It\nis the policy of the City of Frederick to adhere to all\napplicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nUSEPA's RMPlan provisions are intended to have facilities 1)\nprepare for and prevent the potential for a catastrophic\nrelease or explosion and 2) coordinate emergency response\nactivities both internally and"

However, should such an event occur, the City WWTP\nwill follow the contents of this plan in response to the\nemergency or potential emergency.\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68, facilities are required to comply with the\nRMPlan requirements for re-submittal of their plan within 5-\nyears after their initial submittal.  Our re-submittal is\ndue on May 19, 2005.  Compliance with this rule includes an\nelectronic submittal to USEPA of required data elements\nusing EPA's RMP*Submit 2004 software.  The RMPlan and the\ndata elements required in the submittal were developed based\non USEPA's guidance documents including: RMP*Submit 2004\nUser's Manual:  Accidental Release Prevention Requirement;\nRisk Management Program Requirement Under Clean Air Act\nSection 112(r)(7); Amendments to the Submission Schedule and\nData Requirements:  A Checklist for Resubmitting Your Risk\nManagement Plan (RMP) For Chemical Accident Prevention.\n\nAfter determining that the chlorine and sulfur dioxide\ntreatment systems were applicable processes, the City WWTP\nperformed a program applicably assessment to determine the\nspecific RMP requirements for the chemical treatment\nsystems.  This assessment is dependent on the following four\nfactors.\n\n\n\n1)   Five-Year Accident History:  The chlorine and sulfur\ndioxide systems have never had an accidental release since\nthey were installed in 1987.\n2)   SIC Code of the Facility:  The facilities SIC Code is\n4952, sewerage systems.\n3)   Applicability of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\nRegulations:  The treatment process is subject to the OSHA\nPSM standard outlines in 29 CFR 1910.119.  Since the worse\ncase analysis identified impacted offsite public receptors\nand the facility is subject to OSHA's PSM regulations, the\ntreatment processes are subject to Risk Management Program\n3.\n\nThe City of Frederick has also ensured that the facility i"
