The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge that is over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe top priority of Frank Brunckhorst Company, LLC is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort Frank Brunckhorst Company, LLC has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.  \n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) PSM Standard 29 CFR\n\n1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management's Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated. Of the\n\n14 PSM elements 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response. It\n\nis the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for\n\nimprovement.\n\nIn the event of an emergency Frank Brunckhorst Company, LLC will evacuate or shelter in place, depending on\n\nthe type and magnitude of the emergency, its employees and call Hamilton Township Fire Department to\n\nrespond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFrank Brunckhorst Company, LLC is a food distribution center located in Groveport, Ohio. The distribution center includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PR"
