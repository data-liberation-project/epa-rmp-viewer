This facility manufactures Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan.  Methyl Mercaptan is used to produce photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and Methionine, a synthetic amino acid used in animal feed supplement.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and for the Beaumont plant include:\n\nToxics\nMethyl Mercaptan\t\t74-93-1\nHydrogen Sulfide\t\t7783-06-4\nCarbon Disulfide\t\t75-15-0\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlammables\n\nEthyl Mercaptan\t\t75-08-1\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic failure of the Methyl Mercaptan storage tank.   Methyl Mercaptan is stored as a liquid in the storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Methyl Mercaptan stored to 90% of the tank liquid capacity. This quantity ( 1,300,000 pounds ) is assumed to be released over a ten minute time period and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  \n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions, the release could produce a Methyl Mercaptan vapor plume that could travel up to 19 (EPA Look-up Table) miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and the environment.  It should be noted that the worst case scenario is recognized by the regulatory agency and Elf Atochem as an extremely unlikely event. It is noted that the worst case scenari"

It is stored as a liquid.  Administrative controls limit the quantity  of Ethyl Mercaptan stored to 90% of the tank liquid capacity.  This quantity ( 2,000,000 pounds ) is assumed to be released over a 10 minute time period as a vapor.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions , the potentially affected area is a maximum distance of 0.90 (EPA Look-up Table) miles which corresponds to end point distance of a 1 psi overpressure.  Again, it is noted that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and Elf Atochem has implemented mitigation and prevention programs to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident from occurring.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Beaumont plant make it very unlikely that a significant release involving Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Elf Atochem has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community.  \n\nIn accordance with the guidelines used to define worst case incidents, active mitigation measures were not considered in modeling the worst case scenarios.  However, the significant mitigation measures implemented at the Beaumont plant will  effectively reduce the risk and consequences associated with a RMP worst case incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress             vapor.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n\n* Member of area"

This scenario involves the release of 12,900 pounds of Methyl Mercaptan.  Under atmospheric stability class D, conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 0.30 miles based on a 60 minute release.  This distance provides for material to disperse sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. \n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - HYDROGEN SULFIDE\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance ( 56% Hydrogen Sulfide mixture) involves a 1 inch leak in the piping between the Methyl Mercaptan reactor and Reactor effluent product separator. This scenario involves the release of 15,500 pounds of Hydrogen Sulfide.  Under atmospheric stability class D conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 0.30 miles based on a 60 minute release.

      "SummaryText": "SE SCENARIO - ETHYL MERCAPTAN\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substance ( Ethyl Mercaptan ) involves a 1 inch hole in the bottom of the Reactor effluent product separator.  This scenario involves the release of 10,840 pounds of Ethyl Mercaptan and subsequent flash fire that potentially affects an area of 100 feet. This distance provides for material to disperse sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. \n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, they are still very unlikely to occur due to the facility's existing release and accident prevention program.  If a release should occur, Elf Atochem has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The prevention program elements in place at Beaumont are:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to                      suppress vapor.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n\n* Member of area Mutual-Aid organization.\n\n* Vapor Scrubbing System\n\n* Flare System\n\n* Excess Flow Valves on Storage Tanks\n\n* Dikes\n\n* Emergency Shutdown Systems\n\n* Area Gas Detectors\n\n* Planned Inspection Programs\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Elf Atochem Beaumont plant has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases.  This program is designed to address the requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119. Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The accident prevention program includes the following elements and activities:\n\nIn-depth process hazard analysis studies conducted every five years by personnel knowledgeable with the process.
