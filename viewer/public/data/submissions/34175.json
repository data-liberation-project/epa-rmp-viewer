      "SummaryText": "1. The Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Farmers Exchange Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. The maximun quantity stored would be 50000 pounds in the facility's  #1 tank.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum released would be 50000 pounds which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 0.79 miles\n\nThe alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 1.25 inch transfer hose, with 10000pounds release over two minutes. The distance to endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 0.56 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and low Pressure Nitrogen solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental release of anhydruos ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or si"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\n\n7. Plan Changes To Improve Safety: Safety is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety reccommendations for implementation at this time."
