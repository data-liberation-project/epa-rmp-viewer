This plan specifically identifies the risks and mitigation measures applied in a Chlorine Chemical Environment. This plan also includes but is not limited to a Chlorine Environment specific formal Operator Training Program, SOP's, Hazard Analysis/Risk Assessment Review, and Accident History Review.  We have had (2) accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years the largest was 15 lbs. There was no offsite impact. One operator was injured as a result of chlorine inhalation on the site. The Emergency Response Program is a written plan specifically for a chlorine environment which consists of but is not limited to SOP's for Responders, On-site Emergency Responder Training Program, Responder Specific duties, Responder equipment inventory, and Accident/Drill reporting Procedures. Citywide drills are conducted on an annual schedule. The Emergency Response Plan is distributed to Fire, Police, and Emergency MedicalPersonnel.  Process hazard analysis and risk assessment review is conducted by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Senior Environmental Engineer (vacant as of 03/11/2012), Maintenance Personnel, and Operating Personnel. The total process experience of these individuals exceeds 80 years. Operating procedures are written and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is formulated and tracked by the Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Asst. Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is accomplished in the classroom and on the job by the Operator Training Committee which consists of supervisory personnel and certified EHS operators. Understanding of the training is assured by written tests, oral tests, and demonstration. Training is tracked by a database and hardcopy records."
