The KC Plant is a responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe P&G KC Plant manufactures liquid dish detergents and raw materials for use in other P&G products and for sale to other companies.  These include Dawn, Ivory, Joy and Gain which might be found in a home kitchen.  The P&G KC Plant has been in continuous operation since 1905, and it is the first P&G plant opened outside of Cincinnati, Ohio, P&G's corporate headquarters.\n\n\n\nIn Kansas City and elsewhere, P&G has a long-standing commitment to a safe work environment for employees and minimizing the impact of our operations on the environment.  Our safety and environmental programs are managed by highly skilled employees and are actively supported by the participation of all employees and all management, and a strong corporate staff.  The goal of both the safety and environmental programs is prevention.  P&G believes in a zero defect work environment where issues are identified and fixed as a part of daily work.  This zero defect mentality leads to continuously improving operations and zero incidents that could harm people or the environment.  Although P&G's safety record is already among"

Incident and Near Miss reporting is encouraged and rewarded.  Any incidents or near misses on site are followed by a thorough incident investigation and follow-up action steps are taken to prevent recurrence.  Routine inspection, as well as detailed analysis using non destructive test equipment such as boriscopes, ultrasonic thickness instruments, dye penetration tests, etc.,  are routinely used to ensure the equipment is at optimal condition at all times.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nThe P&G Kansas City Soap Plant uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is a necessary material used to manufacture soaps and detergents.\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin is delivered to the plant in dedicated rail cars and is unloaded into two tanks.  Dikes surround the unloading and tank storage areas, and both locations are grounded.  Neither tank is allowed to be more than half full, which allows the transfer of the contents from one to the other during maintenance or an emergency.  Each tank is inspected externally every year and the integrity of the metal walls is routinely examined.  Both the storage and unloading areas are protected by a foaming deluge system that employees can activate remotely.  Firefighting monitor nozzles are located around the tanks, as are remote video cameras.  Epichlorohydrin is completely consumed in the manufacturing of detergent.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe P&G KC Plant has implemented the Program Level 2 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n\n\n     Process Safety Information\n\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n\n     Operating Procedures\n\n        Training\n\n     Maintenance/Mec"

Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis.  Spills or leaks can be noted immediately and reported to control room operators.  The plant has a direct line to the Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department for quick reporting of releases.  The fire and police departments have developed procedures to communicate instructions to the public in the event that action is needed.  These communications can be carried out either by radio or TV broadcast or through direct communications in the streets.\n\n\n\nThe plant now has a fully functional trained Hazwoper Team that drills regularly.  Additionally, the site conducts regular Community Awareness Emergency Response drills.  Local agencies and response organizations are invited to participate.  Real scenarios are simulated and then reviewed and evaluated by everyone in an effort to improve our response systems and hone the skills of the responders.  This gives the non-P&G emergency responders opportunity to tour the site and improves their relationship and communication with P&G.  All P&G employees who work in the vicinity of Epichlorohydrin have been thoroughly trained in company standard operating procedures for both routine and non-routine operations.  These workers participate in the drills with local emergency preparedness officials as well as conducting table-top exercises within their operating teams.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nThe KC Plant is committed to improving our safety systems.
