      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for the CITY OF MYRTLE BEACH SURFACE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe City of Myrtle Beach's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies show that they are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and adheres to all applicable regulations.  The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is the City of Myrtle Beach's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe City of Myrtle Beach uses one (1) regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine with a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is used in the water treatment processes.  Chlorine is handled in one-ton cylinders and the maximum amount of chlorine handled is 30,000 pounds. The City of Myrtle Beach is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n \nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  EPA defines the worst-case release scenario as a release of the largest storage vessel over a ten (10) minute period due to an unspecified failure.  EPA defines the alternative release as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release.  The City of Myrtle Beach chose DEGADIS+ to perform the air dispersion consequence modeling due to the nature of the chemical and the release scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for the City of Myr"

      "SummaryText": "tle Beach involves a catastrophic release from a one-ton cylinder (2,000 lb.) of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The chlorine at the Surface Water Treatment Facility is enclosed; therefore, a release from the plant would be mitigated passively (reduced by 45%).  The worst-case release rate was calculated to be 110 lb/min.  The worst case release was analyzed at Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, 98 F, 73% humidity and 0.1 m surface roughness for the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  The alternative release resulted in offsite impact.\n\nTo be conservative, Myrtle Beach SWTF chose the alternative release scenario for chlorine as a full valve failure in a one-ton cylinder (2,000 lb.) of chlorine inside the chlorine feed area that is enclosed.  The facility is equipped with an emergency chlorine scrubber that has a minimum removal efficiency of 99.997%.  The failure released the entire contents of chlorine in a gaseous form through the 1\" diameter opening and the scrubber neutralized prior to release to the atmosphere. The mitigated alternative release rate was calculated to be 0.0034 lb/min.  The alternative release scenario was analyzed at Class D atmospheric stability, 3.0 m/s wind speed, 63.5 F, 73% humidity and 0.1 m surface roughness for the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  The alternative release did not result in offsite impact.\n\nThe alternative release is much more likely to occur at the facility than the worst-case release scenario. The worst case release is unrealistic because at that high of a release rate, the chlorine will most likely freeze over the hole in the container which will prohibit more chlorine gas from escaping.  It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour exposure time standard. The toxic endpoint concentration is based on a one-hour exposure time, while the worst-case release occurs over a ten-minute period.  Therefore, the ten-minu"

      "SummaryText": "te release period is used as the averaging time instead of one-hour exposure time.  Realistically, if a person can withstand a certain concentration over a one-hour period with no health effects, they could withstand a higher concentration over a ten-minute period.  One solution would be to adjust the toxic endpoint value to correlate to the ten-minute exposure during a worst-case release instead of the one-hour standard.  However, there is no allowance in the RMP rule by the EPA to make this adjustment.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \n \nThe City of Myrtle Beach has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are key to the prevention program:\n1. Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.\n2. Comprehensive process hazard analysis is conducted to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluated.\n3. Operating procedures have been developed and implemented which describe tasks to be preformed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, emergency operating procedures and safety and health precautions to be taken.\n4. Employee training program is in effect to ensure that the employees of the facilities are properly trained and aware on-going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure safe process operation.\n6. Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that all unplanned events affecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely manner to identify the causes of the incident and to implement corrective action.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe City of Myrtle Beach Surface Water Treatment Facility has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to the effective rel"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\n \nThe last Process Hazard Analysis was performed in April 1999.  The Process Hazard Analysis resulted in no recommended changes at the Surface Water Treatment Facility."
