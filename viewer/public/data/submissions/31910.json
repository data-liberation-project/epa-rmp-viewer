Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgraded to prevent accidental releases.  Should an accidental release occur, response activities will be coordinated through the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  On-site plant personnel are trained to make repairs to contain small accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant treats sewage from most of Jackson, East Rankin County and West Madison County, discharging the treated water into the Pearl River.  The plant uses chlorine gas to disinfect the wastewater.  Sulfur dioxide gas is used to dechlorinate the wastewater prior to being discharged into the river.  The chlorine gas is stored in 32 one-ton cylinders.  The sulfur dioxide gas is stored in 8 one-ton cylinders.  At a given time, 8 of the cylinders are connected on a single header.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA mandates that the Worst Case Release Scenario have a release of the entire contents of a largest single container of each regulated substance during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and F atmospheric stability class.  Distances for releases were developed using tables listed in EPA?s ?RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.?  For a 1-ton release of chlorine of sulfur dioxide gas, the distance to the ?Toxic Endpoint? is 1.3 miles, affecting approximately 3.035 residents and nearby schools, major commercial areas, and the recreational area along the Pearl River.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs recommended by the ?RMP Guidance for Wast"

      "SummaryText": "ewater Treatment Plants,? a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D atmospheric stability class were used.  Gas was assumed to be released through a 1? diameter break in the supply piping.  The release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage assumed the release of 135 pounds, producing a distance to the ?Toxic Endpoint? of 0.1 miles, affecting no residents.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours each day including holidays with at least two operators. These operators inspect the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems at least twice each shift.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and audible alarms.  Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases.  The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment are performed in accordance with manufacturer?s instructions.  Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular training the use and maintenance of the equipment through monthly safety meetings, seminars provided by the equipment manufacturers and formal classes provided through the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators? Association and others.\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the last five years, the plant has not had any releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide which resulted in death, injury, evacuations, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe savanna Street Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an emergency response program.  Once it is determined that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City Fire Department, City Police Department and Hinds County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  Through discussions in monthly Safety Meetings, through formal training conducted by the M"

Association and others and through annual emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through the respective Public Affairs personnel at the Police, Fire and Public Works Departments and the EOC.  In the event telephone contact is not possible, emergency dispatch will be conducted using the City-wide radio system.\n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety\n\nA UV system was installed to reduce the amount of chlorine used and the system has been re-engineered by the installation of vacuum regulators on all one-ton cylinders.  24 hours plant security has been added, and the Business Management system inplemented to assess risks."
