Sinclair Refining Company purchased the refinery in 1934 and operated it until 1972, including a period of operations as a subsidiary of Atlantic Richfield Company.  In 1972, PASCO purchased the refinery and operated it until 1976 when it was acquired by Sinclair Oil Corporation, the present owner and operator.  Sinclair Wyoming Refining Company is official name of the refinery. \n\n\n\nDescription of Refinery Processes:\n\nSWRC includes modern process units typically used for production of petroleum fuels; atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, delayed coking, alkylation and associated supporting operations such as crude oil unloading, sulfur recovery, blending and crude oil/product storage and transport.  The NAICS code for the SWRC is 324110. \n\n\n\nDescription of Refinery Products:\n\nSWRC manufacturers the following generic products/by-products:\n\n\n\n\n\nAsphalt        Black Oil    Petroleum Coke\n\nDiesel Fuel    Fuel Oil     Sulfur\n\nGasoline    Jet Fuel    Liquefied Petroleum Gases\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program and Plan (RMP) - Definition of Processes and Regulated Substances: \n\nThe RMP rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.

There are multiple processes where flammable mixtures present in quantities above RMP threshold.  None of the toxic substances listed above exceed the threshold quantity for toxics.  Based upon threshold quantities and process definition, the SWRC is reporting the following nine processes in its RMP: \n\n\n\n?    582 Vacuum/Crude Unit\n\n?    581 Crude Unit\n\n?

Renewable Diesel - Hydrocracker Unit  \n\n?    #4 HDS Unit\n\n?    Coker  \n\n\n\nOther processes at the SWRC either do not have regulated flammable substances or contain such substances in quantities below the RMP applicability threshold.\n\n\n\nSWRC has multiple processes that contain H2S and SO2.  The maximum quantity of H2S and SO2 in any process does not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Ammonia is used in several processes in amounts less than 10,000 pounds at each process.  Because the quantities of these toxic substances are less than their respective RMP threshold values, none of the toxic substances is RMP reportable.

SWRC works proactively to provide a safe workplace for each employee and continues to promote safety practices among employees for their health and welfare.  This is accomplished by actively assuring wide employee participation in a thorough PSM program and appropriate safety training.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM program is managed by at the site with a local team, with accountability to the Refinery Manager, with technical input from the corporate team.   The PSM program conforms to OSHA regulations contained in 29 CFR 1910.119.   SWRC has devoted the leadership, manpower, and capital investment necessary to complete the program.  SWRC updates the PSM Program and RMP for each significant process change and at least every five years.  \n\n\n\nSWRC's management recognizes and firmly believes in the need for a safe environment for both the refinery and the local community.  SWRC's policies ensure that our efforts with prevention through planning, training, reasonable process controls, timely maintenance and communication with our neighbors will help prevent unforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  Should a release nevertheless occur, SWRC's trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, have been trained to respond, mitigate and contain the release. \n\n\n\nPSM Program:\n\nFor the RMP-covered processes, uses OSHA'S PSM standard as our prevention program.

In addition, the Employee Participation Steering Committee is chartered with finding opportunities to improve employee participation.  It includes management, professional, and hourly employees. \n\n\n\nEmployees have access to all information that is part of the accident prevention program.  Copies of the information are located in the unit operations buildings for quick access, and available in the electronic documentation systems through an electronic reporting and recordkeeping program.\n\n\n\nExamples of employee participation include participating in the HAZOP analysis of each unit, updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information for their unit area and being trained on any changes to operational or mechanical information that may affect them.  Employees are also participants on our teams that address both process and worker safety.  Teams are often comprised of representatives from plant management, safety, operations, environmental, maintenance and engineering. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe SWRC keeps technical and safety documentation for each unit that falls under the PSM standard.

The company conducts a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with a team formed of knowledgeable, trained personnel from safety, maintenance, operations, environmental, engineering and plant management.  The team evaluates potential process hazards and identifies accident prevention and mitigation measures to ensure safe operating and maintenance of units.  The team makes recommendations about systems, procedures or practices to put in place to ensure that hazards are managed and mitigated. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are shared with local management for review and resolution.  Implementation of systems, procedures and practices is based on a determination of risk associated with the findings.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The PSM group manages all information about the HAZOP analysis, team members, recommendations and resolutions. \n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, SWRC updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  The revalidation team consists of the same types of personnel as the initial HAZOP team.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will continue on that schedule until the unit is no longer operating or is removed.  Revalidated hazard analysis results are tracked, submitted for management review and retained/documented.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nSWRC maintains written procedures for all operations and worker functions at the refinery.  All are available in the control rooms and electronically to all personnel.  The procedures address various modes of unit operation, including: \n\n\n\n?    Unit Startup\n\n?

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  These procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC process.  \n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nSWRC compliments the written operating procedures with a comprehensive training program.  New employees receive initial training in refinery operations and safety practices.  After successfully completing this training, the new operator or technician receives a manual that guides them to an understanding of their responsibilities.  Training manuals include descriptions of the equipment, how it works and what is involved in its operation.

Contractors are chosen and vetted based on their safety records, training, and qualifications.  Contract employees are not allowed onto the refinery property until they have received approval and training.  \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:\n\nSWRC conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  \n\n\n\nThe PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
