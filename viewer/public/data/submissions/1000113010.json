Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the BPEP accident prevention program, which is documented in an employee participation plan. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nBPEP keeps a variety of documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within BPEP are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, BPEP has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, composition, etc. BPEP ensures that the process is maintained within these safe limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems, pressure relieving systems).\nBPEP also maintains numerous documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. BPEP primarily uses the Knowledge-Based and Guideword Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) studies to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. These analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards on the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and may make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls are consistent with design safety features, the BPEP periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. In addition to these periodic reviews, hazard reviews are also performed during the design stage of new facilities and for facilities undergoing significant modification.\n\nOperating Procedures\nBPEP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as;\n(1)\tstartup;\n(2)\tnormal operations; \n(3)\tshutdown;\n(4) \temergency operations; and,\n(5) \temergency shutdown. \n\nThese procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.

Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made. \n\nTraining is also provided for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment. This training includes an overview of BPEP\u0092s manufacturing process and its hazards. Training is provided on specific procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to assure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe manner.\n\nContractors\nBPEP uses contractors to supplement its workforce where appropriate. Contractors are to adhere to all safety rules and practices applicable to ExxonMobil employees, as well as their own safety rules and practices.

ExxonMobil personnel monitor contractor performance to confirm that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup and Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nBPEP conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information controlled by management of change (MOC). The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBPEP employs extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of process equipment and safety systems. Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance techniques to identify preventative maintenance opportunities before failure occurs. This program also specifies the repairs needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\nThe basic aspects of this program include:\n(1)\tconducting training;\n(2)\tdeveloping written procedures;\n(3)\tperforming inspections and tests;\n(4)\tcorrecting identified deficiencies; and,\n(5)\tapplying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or else the equipment use will be reviewed to determine what actions are necessary to ensure the continued safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. BPEP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nBPEP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. These include orientations for visitors/contractors, control of the entry/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure to safely manage spark-producing activities, control of vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure to help ensure precautions are taken before entering confined spaces, and job safety analyses to identify and mitigate hazards associated with maintenance tasks.
