Our policy is to implement reasonable \ncontrols to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our \ntrained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex is located at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563.  \nThe facility is owned by BP Amoco Corporation.  The primary purpose of the facility is to conduct both\npetroleum and chemical research and development.  A secondary purpose is to provide office space for \na other BP Amoco employees unrelated to the research and development activities.  At present, the \nfacility has only one process -- the 300 Tank Farm -- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk \nManagement Planning requirements.  This process contains three flammable regulated substances \nwhich are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows:  isobutylene mixture, propylene and \nethylene.  Please note that the BP Amoco Naperville Complex has no regulated toxic substances in \nexcess of  the threshold quantity.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an \noverpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The WCS endpoint is based on the \ninstantaneous release of the entire contents isobutylene (60,000 pounds) from t"

Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the \nmethodology outlined in EPA\u0012s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby public receptors \ncould be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail \nin this document.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the facility is a VCE resulting from the \nrelease of propylene through a relief valve at the 300 Tank Farm.  It is not anticipated that this release\nwould travel beyond property boundaries.  However, operators would still respond to the situation in a \ntimely manner. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Amoco Naperville \nComplex for all EPA RMP covered processes, presently only the 300 Tank Farm.  Since this process is \nalso regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, this summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM \nelements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex encourages employees who work at the 300 Tank Farm to participate \nin multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee \nparticipation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a \nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the \nfacility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in the \nemployee participation plan.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe personnel at the 300 Tank Farm keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limit"

This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with \nthe inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The 300 Tank Farm has documented safety-related limits for \nspecific process parameters.  The 300 Tank Farm personnel help assure that the process is maintained \nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective \ninstrument systems.  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation \nfrom these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe 300 Tank Farm also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and \nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure\n and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This \ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for \nestablishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and \nfacility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic \nand thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who \nhave operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and \nevaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes \nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures\nare necessary.\n\nThe PHA team\u0012s recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These \nrecommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\nThe final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly\nfrom the original design safety features, the BP Amoco Naperville Complex periodically updates and \nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years \nas long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to \nmanagement.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex maintains written procedures that address the operation of the 300\nTank Farm.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide \na basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually \ncertified as current and accurate.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected \npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Amoco Naperville Complex has \nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New \nemployees receive basic training in research and development  operations.  After successfully \ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties \nand tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate \nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure \nthat their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted\nat least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the \noperator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex routinely uses contractors to supplement maintenance, construction \nand operation efforts.

This is accomplished by providing \ncontractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency \nresponse plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.  In addition, the BP\nAmoco Naperville Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection \nof a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors\n are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety\nfeatures, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing \nthe equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The \nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification \nof the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident \nprevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping \nystems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems\nin a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, \n(2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting \nidentified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Written procedures help \nensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and\ntests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is \nwithin acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, \nemployees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an \nMOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the \nsafe operation of the equipment.\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex has a hot work permit program which details those areas which \nrequire a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required.  A permit is required in process areas\nfor all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc.  The procedure includes accountability and \nresponsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot\nwork until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with \nthe hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex has a  system to manage changes to the 300 Tank Farm.  \nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology \n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other changes be properly reviewed \nand authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls \nare in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have"

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are\nprovided any necessary training on the change.  The system helps to ensure that all documentation is \nupdated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe BP Amoco Naperville Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably \ncould have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or \npersonal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions \nto prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its \nfindings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management\nfor resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and \nrecommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or \nrecommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including \ncontractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least \n5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly at the 300 Tank Farm, the \nBP Amoco Naperville Complex periodically conducts an audit. Compliance audits are conducted at least\nevery 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.
