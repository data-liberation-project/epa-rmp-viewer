Prior to this date, the facility was operated by Armor Eckrich Branded Meats, LLC (Smithfield Foods) for the processing and storage of meat products.  The facility is currently being maintained by Sara Lee Food & Beverage as a vacated refrigerated warehouse. \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSara Lee Food & Beverage is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Sara Lee Food & Beverage has proactively partnered with the Kansas City Fire Department to provide properly trained and equipped hazmat responders that are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  We also will coordinate such events with the Wyandotte County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) for additional support.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is currently a vacated anhydrous ammonia refrigerated warehouse.  The NAICS code for this process is 49312 (Refrigerated Warehouse & Storage).  The only RMP regulated substance present at our facility is ammonia, utilized as the primary cooling media in the closed-loop refrigeration system.  \n\nThe facility has two separate ammonia closed loop refrigeration system (FES & Frick), however, only the Frick System containing 12,800 pounds of ammonia is charged and active.  The FES System has been d"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nSara Lee Food & Beverage maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies so that hazards associated with our ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses are What If Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations, and are reevaluated at a minimum of every five (5) years. Any findings related to the process hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities related to our ammonia refrigeration system, Sara Lee Food & Beverage maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.

Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe plant uses a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for control scheduling and accomplishment of preventative maintenance on components of the refrigeration system.  Preventative maintenance checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in ammonia system's technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by an ammonia systems modification, are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system, or any of its components, are opened for repairs, tie-ins, or modifications. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAudits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
