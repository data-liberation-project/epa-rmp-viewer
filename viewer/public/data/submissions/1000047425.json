Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Legacy Packing and Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Legacy Packing and Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Legacy Packing and Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name          |         Process Chemical         |         Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration           Anhydrous Ammonia                  64,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigerating capacity to the following:\n\n(8) Precool Rooms\n\n(10) Storage Rooms\n\n(2) Hydrocoolers\n\n(2) Bin Rooms\n\n(2) Loading Docks\n\n\n\nThe rooms use \"bunker style\" coils and the loading dock uses ceiling suspended evaporator coils. Both types of coils contain chilled liquid ammonia.  Most of the system uses a flooded (gravity fed) system design; while Room 9 and Precool 5-7 uses a pumped overfeed system design. A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\n    \n\nThe flooded portion of the system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped through the king solenoid valve.  From there it is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to one of our main suction accumulators.  From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to our water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned t"

Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action.  \n\n\n\nThe pumped overfeed portion of the system and it operates as follows: High pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to the pump drum through a liquid feed solenoid valve and expansion valve.  In the pump drum, low temperature liquid is separated from gas.  The gas is piped back to the main suction accumulators.  The liquid is pumped to each pumped overfeed zone, where it passes through a solenoid valve and hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through check valves and is returned to the pump drum.  \n\n\n\nThe facility was originally built in 1994-1995.  More recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n1997 - Room 2 and Precool 2 were added\n\n1999 - Room 3-4, Precool 3-4, Bin Room 2, and Hydrocooler 2 were added\n\n2001 - Room 5-6 were added\n\n2002 - Precool 5-7 were added\n\n2004 - Room 7-8 and Precool 8 were added\n\n2005 - Room 9 was added\n\n2007 - Room 10 was added\n\n2011 - California Controlled Atmosphere renovated the computer control system\n\n\n\nThe systems contain numerou"

In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the each system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nFruit Patch has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Legacy Packing and Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we"

Nevertheless, Legacy Packing and Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Fruit Patch's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Fruit Patch's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nFruit Patch has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past "

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Fruit Patch employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Fruit Patch will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
