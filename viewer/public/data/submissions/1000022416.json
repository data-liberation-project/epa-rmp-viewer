With the addition of (10)1,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks with a capacity of 43,755 pounds, this makes the company's total capacity of 97,000 pounds.\n\nThe worse case and alternative release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program. More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nOur plant is maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are trained on a regular basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant as well as the procedures to fill a nurse tank.  Our workers always have safety water on hand and wear the proper personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during ammonia operations.\n\nThis company is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years resulting in injury, property damage, death, evacuation, sheltering in place, or other emergency procedures. \n\nOur emergencyresponse plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public and area emergency responders. Our company's emergency response plan is shared with the local fire department and the  county LEPC.
