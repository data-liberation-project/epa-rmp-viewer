It is our belief that those things\n\nwhich contribute to  safe operations also improve quality\n\nand reduce costs.   This commitment to safety can be seen in\n\nthe investment of resources made for accident prevention.\n\nThese efforts include extensive employee training, and a\n\nsystematic approach to safety in the design, installation,\n\noperation, and maintenance of our processes.   Our policy is\n\nto implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable\n\nreleases of dangerous substances.  To supplement these\n\ncontrols, additional safeguards are provided to reduce the\n\nimpact of a release should one occur in spite of all\n\nprecautions.

The plant is situated on\n\napproximately 5 acres in north Fort Worth.  The immediate\n\narea surrounding this plant is open undeveloped land to the\n\nnorth, industrial development including Ferro Corporation\n\nand residential zoned areas lie to the west,\n\ncommercial/residential zoned areas to the south, and the\n\nTrinity River to the east.\n\n\n\nSpecialty surfactant manufacturing has been conducted at\n\nthis location since 1974.  This facility makes a variety of\n\nspecialty surfactants that are used in industrial and\n\nagricultural applications throughout the world.  The plant\n\nis operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Plant\n\nmanufacturing activity can be categorized into 4 major\n\nproduct lines employing a total of 44 people.  During normal\n\noperations, the plant is staffed by 5 hourly plant operators\n\nand 1 quality control technician.  Four m"

Operators are organized as\n\nteams with extensive cross training enabling personnel to\n\nfunction in multiple roles.\n\n\n\nOne of the four major product lines produced at this\n\nfacility is the Morwet D-425 Dispersant.   This product was\n\nfirst produced in 1978.    35% formaldehyde solution is\n\nreacted with a sodium naphthalene process intermediate in\n\ntwo  batch reaction vessels.   The final product of this\n\nprocess is a water based surfactant with highly efficient\n\ndispersant properties.   This product is used in\n\nagricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of\n\nwater dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides,\n\nand fungicides..    The formaldehyde solution is supplied\n\nfrom a 10,400 gallon storage tank.   The maximum intended\n\ninventory is limited to 9824 gallons due to the presence of\n\nhigh level warning systems and procedures which prevent\n\nmaterial additions beyond this level.\n\n\n\nA minor product line involves the manufacture of naphthalene\n\nbased products.   One of those products, scheduled for\n\ninitial production in August 1999, is  Di-Isopropyl\n\nNaphthalene.   This product is a process intermediate which\n\nis further processed at another Witco facility before being\n\nsold as an oil field drilling aid.   This initial\n\nmanufacturing phase involves the reaction of propylene gas\n\nwith naphthalene in the presence of a catalyst.   These two\n\nprocesses were identified during an evaluation of this\n\nfacility's inventory of raw materials, finished products,\n\nand process intermediates to determine if any regulated\n\nflammable or toxic substances used or stored on site\n\nexceeded the threshold quantity.

An audit team reviews\n\nrecords and documents to determine the degree of program\n\ncompliance.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every\n\n3 years.   Audit team findings are documented and presented\n\nto plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\n\ntaken in response to audit findings are tracked until they\n\nare complete.   The two most recent audit reports are\n\nretained.\n\n\n\n1.7   Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe risks associated with the  processes described earlier\n\nin this executive summary require proper management to\n\nprevent accidental releases of regulated substances in this\n\nfacility.\n\n\n\n1.7.1  Specialized Safety Features\n\nWitco's Fort Worth plant has engineered safety features on\n\nthose units which process highly hazardous chemicals to (1)\n\nPrevent a release through early warning of impending upsets,\n\nand/or (2) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in these\n\nprocesses:\n\n\n\n1.7.1.1  Release Prevention Systems\n\n1.   High level probes with alarms\n\n2.   Flow controllers with automatic shutoffs\n\n3.   Pressure relief devices on piping, tanks, and reactor\n\nvessels\n\n4.   Check valves to prevent reverse flow through piping\n\n5.   High temperature and pressure warning systems on the\n\nreactor vessels\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.1.2  Release Containment/Control\n\n1.   Dikes and diversion containment which contain spills\n\n  and limit the surface area of the spill.\n\n2.   Manual valves to permit isolation of the process if\n\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.1.3  Release Mitigation\n\n1.   Employees trained to respond as hazardous materials\n\ntechnicians\n\n2.

Specialized personal protective equipment (e.g.,\n\nchemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing\n\napparatus)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8  Five-Year Accident History\n\nWitco's Fort Worth Plant has not had any accidental releases\n\nduring the past five years which meet the criteria for an\n\naccidental release per 40CFR68.42.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9  Emergency Response Program Information\n\nWitco's Fort Worth plant maintains a written emergency\n\nresponse plan designed to protect worker and public safety\n\nas well as the environment during an emergency.  The plan\n\nconsists of procedures for responding to a release of\n\nformaldehyde, including the possibility of a fire or\n\nexplosion.  These procedures address notification and\n\nemergency signals, specific containment actions, and proper\n\nfirst aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation\n\nplans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the\n\npublic if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and\n\ndecontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has\n\nprocedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing\n\nof emergency response equipment.  All personnel entering the\n\nWitco Fort Worth Plant receive some level of orientation\n\nwhich contains instruction in emergency signals and actions\n\nto be taken during an emergency.   Specific employees are\n\ntrained to Hazardous Materials Technician level for actively\n\nresponding to hazardous materials emergencies.  These\n\npersonnel are sufficiently trained to deal with most\n\nhazardous materials emergencies which might occur in this\n\nfacility.  In the event of more serious emergencies, the\n\nsame personnel are trained and prepared to assist the\n\nefforts of other emergency response personnel in a variety\n\nof support roles.  All employees are trained as first\n\nresponders at the awareness level and in procedures for\n\ncleaning up small spills based on their work assign"

      "SummaryText": "ments.\n\n\n\nOverall emergency response programs are coordinated with the\n\nFort Worth Fire Department.  This coordination includes\n\nbriefings and information sharing to address specific\n\nconcerns in the event of an incident at the plant.  The\n\nWitco Fort Worth Plant has around-the-clock communications\n\ncapability with the Fort Worth Fire Department.   This\n\ndepartment has the capability to communicate to all state,\n\nfederal and county agencies and may draw on whatever\n\nresources or equipment are needed to effectively manage\n\nemergency operations (i.e., firefighting equipment,\n\nmanpower, ambulances, hospitals, law enforcement, and HAZMAT\n\noperations).  This provides a means of notifying the public\n\nof an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a\n\nquick response to an incident.   Witco's Fort Worth Plant\n\nconducts drills annually to assess personnel readiness,\n\nproficiency and the effectiveness of emergency response\n\nplans.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWitco's Fort Worth Plant is constantly striving to improve\n\nprocess safety, quality, and efficiency.   Several\n\nnoteworthy improvements scheduled for the future include\n\n\n\nz    Improvements to the tank truck unloading station which\n\n  involve installation of  dedicated pump and hose systems\n\n  which significantly reduce the risk of an off-loading mishap\n\nz    Spill containment area reductions which reduces the\n\n  surface area size of a spill in off-loading areas.  Reduced\n\n  surface area significantly reduces any resulting vapor\n\n  emissions in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n\n1 Quantity represents formaldehyde minus water solution with\n\n1% methanol.\n\n2 OSHA Interpretation, Patricia K.
