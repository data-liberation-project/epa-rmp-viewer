To protect the lives of plant personnel and the constituents within the zone of influence.\n\n2. For the purpose of mitigating personal injury.\n\n3. To minimize damage to property and the environment.\n\n\n\nThere is a Safety Committee that meets periodically to coordinate safety programs. The facility has two employees that are trained to the First Responder Technician Level in accordance with the HAZWOPER regulations. These two refrigeration technicians can assist the local emergency response team in the event of an incident.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nLocation of Valley Fruit facility is 12 Hoffer Road in Wapato, Washington. Engine Room #1 was constructed in 1988 and Engine Room #2 was constructed in 1995.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant for the cold storage of agricultural products. A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, the refrigerant changes from liquid to gas. At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.\n\n\n\nThere are two separate ammonia refrigeration systems. Engine Room #1 and Engine Room #2.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPractices and procedures ( SOP'S ) for proper ammonia handling are obtained through annual Emergency Response Training that is specifically targeted toward ammonia refrigeration safety. In addition to plant safety policies for the safe handling of ammonia, there are ammonia gas detectors in the cold storage rooms. These sensors activate an automatic dialer system and Engine Room detection notification at 50 ppm to notify the front office, Maintenance Manager, and Refrigeration Engineer.\n\n\n\nFive Year Acc"

      "SummaryText": "ident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no reportable releases of ammonia during the last five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency action plan and will evacuate all affected areas and notify local emergency responders. However the facility has two trained emergency responders which can assist the local emergency response team in the event of a release. These two responders are the refrigeration technicians who have received an initial 24 hour training program with 8 hour annual refresher training specifically relating to ammonia refrigeration safety. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThere is ongoing assessment of the ammonia systems by annual mechanical integrity audits and SOP review, five year mechanical integrity audits including periodic audits of the entire program."
