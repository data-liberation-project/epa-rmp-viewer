      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Plastics Corporation operates a manufacturing plant in Auburn, Maine.  The principle products are Pionite, a decorative laminate used for counter tops and furniture, and amino resin coated paper used as a decorative surface for particle board, and other substrates.  Pioneer also manufactures specialty resins both for resale and use in the production of Pionite and low pressure laminates.  Formaldehyde is used as a monomer incorporated into Pioneer's amino resins synthesis.  Formaldehyde is delivered as a Formalin solution (typically at 37%, but potentially at 50% Formaldehyde) by commercial trucks in quantities of average loads weighing 56,000 pounds four to five times per week.  The Formalin is transferred to a 20,000 gallon storage tank (typical storage approx. 17,000 gallons(approximately 160,000 pounds) and via a pipe bridge the Formalin is transferred to the production area.  Pioneer Plastics accidential release prevention program for RMP has been prepared in conjunction with the current program regulated by the OSHA PSM requirements, Stormwater Pollution Prevention, RCRA, and Wastewater regulations.  The PSM requirements have resulted in various projects by which high level alarms, vessel inspections, hazard analysis and improved operations by written procedures and training being implemented.  Pioneer Plastics has an Emergency Response Plan that involves the local fire departments, emergency medical personnel, hospitals and Emergency Response contractors in the event of an accidential release at the facility.  The Pioneer Plastics Emergency Response Team consists of 16 members with all trained in HAZMAT.  A local county emergency response team has been established (COBRA) that can respond if requested.  The local fire department can also provide support in decontamination operations and evacuation of affected residents if needed.  SARA Title III and the Maine DEP require that the local fire department and LEPC be notified in the event of a reportable"
