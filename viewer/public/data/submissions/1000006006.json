      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - POLYCOAT PRODUCTS\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nPolycoat Products, a division of American Polymers Corporation, has established a Risk Management Plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for the TDI Transfer System to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Polycoat Products is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees, visitors and its neighbors.  Polycoat Products staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The TDI Transfer System, that contains the regulated substance Toluene Di-Isocyanate (TDI), is used for supplying TDI to the polymer production reactors in the process area.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPolycoat Products has an emergency response plan in place to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include specific steps that Polycoat Products management expects of its employees to take to protect health of the employees, visitors and the neighbors.  The Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, key phone numbers and contact points, vicinity and evacuation maps, and instructions for evacuation and for actions to be taken in case of a fire, injury, earthquake and chemical spill.  The Emergency Plan is reviewed and updated periodically to ensure that it remains current.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe TDI Transfer System consists of a double walled storage tank, a transfer pump, piping,valves and a bank of scrubbers that are used during the filling operation,.  TDI storage tank is designed for truck and marine transport like a containerized cargo.  Therefore, it includes features to enhance its rugg"

      "SummaryText": "edness.  The tank is used as a stationary tank at this site.  All piping attached to the tank, penetrate tank boundaries from the top.  This, in addition to the double wall feature, provides an added safety against spillage of tank contents.  \n\nTDI is used in small quantities in the reactors to produce polymers.  Transfer is accomplished via a transfer pump that is controlled automatically by a flow meter.  The operator sets the desired quantity in the automatic control unit which then transfers the desired amount to a reactor. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPolycoat Products has a Risk Management Program in place to manage the handling of TDI.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Written procedures are developed as part of this program that specify the steps for every task undertaken related to the TDI system.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   The Risk Management Program also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  In addition to the Risk Management Program, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are strictly followed.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (June 2004 to June 2009) for the Polycoat Products facility reveals that there were no reportable accidents during this period.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPolycoat Products is taking additional steps to further public and personnel safety.  Several studies have been conducted recently to examine potential release s"
