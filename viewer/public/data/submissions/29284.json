Flange gasket leak of ethylenediamine on EDA distribut ion line with off-site impacts.  A dike is taken into consideration as passive mitigation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, this facility is in compliance with the EPA Risk Management Program, the OSHA Process Safety Management standard, the Chemical Manufacturer Association's Responsible Care Process Safety Code, and the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe  Prevention Act.\n\nSignificant chemical-specific prevention steps that are found at the facility include:\n? Being prepared to handle unexpected rises in temperature and pressure by using automatic shut-off device and relief valves.\n? Multiple layers of protections such as safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors.\n?

This facility believes that an employee's suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how, and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.  \n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n? Switching to gaskets that are more resistant to corrosive materials.\n? Pumps which transfer ethylene oxide and propylene oxide no longer use packing glands.\n? Increasing the number of stationary combustible gas detectors.  \n? Readiness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) potential computer bug.\n? Connecting all stack emissions for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ethylenediamine to a central control device which decreases the emissions to the atmosphere."
