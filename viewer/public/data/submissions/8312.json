The WWTP Division in conjunction with the Dothan Fire Department conducts an annual chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak drill at one of our facilities.  This is a full scale drill simulating a cylinder rupture with injuries and simulating evacuation procedures.\n\nThe WWTP Division has three wastewater treatment plants that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas in one ton cylinders used for disinfection of treated wastewater.  The quantities stored at each facility is as follows:  Little Choctawhatchee - 6,000# chlorine gas and 6,000# sulfur dioxide; Beaver Creek - 8,000# chlorine gas and 6,000# sulfur dioxide; Omussee Creek - 10,000# chlorine gas and 8,000# sulfur dioxide.  The total amount stored at all of the wastewater treatment plants is 24,000# chlorine gas and 20,000# sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for all three wastewater treatment plants would result in a maximum threat zone for sulfur dioxide of 3.2 miles.  Based on our most recent 1990 census, this release will affect a residential population of 4,900 from Little Choctawhatchee, 25,000 from Beaver Creek, and 5,900 from Omussee Creek.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide will affect a residential population of 2,800 from Little Choctawhatchee, 17,000 from Beaver Creek, and 3,600 from Omussee Creek within 2.6 miles.  The alternate release scenario for chlorine will affect a residential population of 2,700 from Little Choctawhatchee, 16,000 from Beaver Creek, and 3,500 from Omussee Creek within 2.4 miles.\n\nThe WWTP Division has complied with the OSHA PSM rule, although Alabama is not an OSHA state.  The WWTP Division conducts training for all operators in safe handling and SOP as well as emergency response procedures.  All safety equipment is regularly"

Both training and inspections are documented.\n\nThe WWTP Division has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas in the last five years.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, WWTP Division personnel will notify the Dothan Fire Department by either radio or land line.  The Dothan Police and Fire Departments will evacuate affected areas.  The Dothan Fire Department's hazardous material team will take charge of stopping or mitigating the release of gas.  The WWTP Division conducts an annual full scale accidental release drill with the Dothan Fire Department and both agencies critique performance for improvements.  The WWTP Division also conducts quarterly leak drills at each facility to ensure all operators are trained in SOP for emergency response.\n\nThe WWTP Division will review SOP and conduct a process hazard analysis every three years in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule."
