      "SummaryText": "The Kaplan Water Treatment Plant is a publicly owned and operated water treatment system which services the city limits of Kaplan, Louisiana in the Parish of Vermilion. From the 2020 Census Data, the total population of Kaplan is 4,352 persons and the plant services approximately 2,300 customers within the City.\r\n\r\nThe operational procedures outlined in the facility's Risk Management Plan ensure that chlorine is safely changed out as necessary. Additionally, the chlorine sensor which can detect even minimal amounts of chlorine serves as the primary alarm that a release has occurred. At that time, the operator on duty must proceed with the emergency response measures in the Risk Management Plan, which includes immediately contacting the Plant Superintendent to assess the severity of the leak, then contacting HAZ-MAT for chemical spill response. The Police Department and the Fire Department would be contacted next if evacuation is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Kaplan Water Treatment Plant operates on two water wells and utilizes the following water treatment processes - lime softening, gravity filtration, and disinfection. The only process involved in the treatment facility which has a regulated substance above the threshold limit is the disinfection process. Chlorine gas is used for disinfection. The facility has two (2) - one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas on-line, which are located in the chlorine storage area, adjacent to the chlorine room. The chlorine room is a separate room in the facility. The storage area and the chlorine room are well ventilated. The storage area is also well equipped with a chlorine sensor which alarms at detection.\r\n\r\nWorst-case release and alternative release scenarios were conducted for the facility. The Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (October 1998) was utilized as a guidance to conduct each scenario. Although the facility is a water treatment plant, the RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants addresses chlorina"

Therefore, this document is also applicable to the City's water treatment plant.\r\n\r\nFor the worst case scenario, the analysis considered the quantity released to be from the largest vessel, the entire affected area is within a 1.3 mile radius of the facility. The affected area for the alternative release scenario was calculated to be within a 0.1 mile radius of the facility. The alternative scenario was conducted for holes in the vessels ranging from 1/16 inch to 1/2 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant personnel operate the facility in accordance with general practices to protect human health and public safety. Proper maintenance and precautions in operating the process equipment is crucial for the general accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases of chlorine in the past five (5) years. Since the facility is not equipped to handle emergency response in case of a major release of chlorine, an emergency response list is compiled which lists the order in contacting emergency response teams."
