The catastrophic release would release approximately 204,400 lbs. of TDI. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 0.1 mile for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance extends beyond the facility property line. There are approximately less than thirty (30) people in nearby industrial setting that may be within the potentially affected area.                    \nThe alternative scenario is an event more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and is a more realistic accident scenario.  FXI, Inc.  has determined that the appropriate alternative scenario for the facility is a shearing of a TDI railcar unloading hose while transferring TDI from a railcar to an on-site TDI storage tank. The leak would release approximately 100 lbs. of TDI. The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 14-yards for the alternative release scenario. The impact distance does not extend beyond the facility property line.           \n          \nD.

Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n4. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n5. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\nC. Hazard Assessment:\nThe RMP requires FXI, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\nThe worst case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident.

An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFXI, Inc. is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Miami, Florida. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in two (2) 14,514-gallon, (1) 10,000-gallon, (1) 5,000-gallon TDI Storage Tanks within the tank storage area. The four (4) TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of 44,028-gallons. The 104,028-gallons of TDI equates to 1, 063, 166 pounds of TDI.\nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.
