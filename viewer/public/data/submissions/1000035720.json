Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz - San Diego is dedicated to operation of a safe facility for is employees and neighboring community.  A safety committee has been established that is responsible for the implementation of the safety program and an Emergency Response Plan.  This includes safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Kraft Heinz - San Diego has prepared risk and safety programs to ensure safe handling of the ammonia in the refrigeration system.  Prior to starting operations in 1997, Kraft Heinz - San Diego conducted the following technical studies to identify potential hazards and the appropriate mitigation measures: Process Hazard Analysis, a Hazard Assessment, and a Seismic Assessment.  In addition, Kraft Heinz - San Diego prepared a Risk Management Prevention Program (RMPP) prior to startup of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Kraft Heinz - San Diego facility is located at 7878 Airway Road in San Diego, California.  The facility started operations at this location in April 1997.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz - San Diego has prepared management programs for compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  These management programs include, but are not limited to, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, management of change, contractor safety, "

In addition, the facility has conducted studies to identify potential hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration system and set up a structure to ensure that recommendations from these studies are addressed.\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz - San Diego personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system 24 hours per day.  If a leak is detected or observed by any Kraft Heinz - San Diego employee, it is immediately reported to the on shift refrigeration engineer.  Action is promptly taken to mitigate the leak so normal operations can resume.\n\n\n\nEngineering Measures\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has several monitoring and sensing devices.  These devices will activate alarms when conditions vary beyond designated limits.  The alarms are indicated on local instrumentation panels, and remote alarms at the facility.  Some alarms will be responded to manually while others are interlocked to another device.  The ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is controlled and monitored using the following: \n\n\n\nProcess indicators and alarms\n\nInspections\n\nPreventative Maintenance\n\nPersonnel training\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nAmmonia Gas Sensors\n\n\n\nD.  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility started operations in April, 1997.  Since that time, there have been no reportable release or near-misses associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nE.  Emergency Response\n\n\n\nKraft Heinz - San Diego has an Emergency Response Plan that includes requirements, for postings, reporting emergencies, evacuation procedures / routes (including re-entry and accountability), communications, rescue duties, etc.  In addition, the refrigeration personnel are current on all HAZWOPER training including 40 hour HAZWOPER Operations Level training.  An emergency response shutdown procedure for the ammonia refrigeration system has been incorporated in to the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Im"
