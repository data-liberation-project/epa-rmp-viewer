      "SummaryText": "Advanced Technical Ceramics Company has a unique process involving anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia storage consists of a storage facility to keep the ammonia on site for its continuous use as a fuel for the firing of the furnaces and the kilns. The ammonia is first piped to a preheater to warm the liquid and then to a unit where it is converted into elemental hydrogen and nitrogen. The hydrogen is piped into the kiln for use as fuel, while the nitrogen is used as a purge gas to prevent oxygen from entering the system. This process has been operated in its current configeration for 24 years.                                                                                                                                                                                   Ammonia is stored and used on site in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for ammonia as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations. Advanced Technical Ceramics Company has diligently developed and implemented comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release.                                                                                                                                                                                The facility has not had an accident in the past five years involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently implemented for the ammonia process. Futhermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.                                                                                                                                                                            In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia process,"
