We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of the employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n*  A description of the Facility\n\n*  A description of the Facility use of substance(s) regulated by USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule\n\n*  An overview of the Facility' accidental release prevention programs\n\n*  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by USEPA's RMP rule\n\n*  An overview of the emergency response program\n\n*  An overview of planned improvements at the Facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases\n\n    \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Facility produces various grades of customer specification aluminum from scrap aluminum recycling using a variety of processing operations.  An integral part of the process is aluminum demagging.  Demagging is the removal of magnesium contaminants from molten aluminum.  Aluminum demagging is accomplished through the injection of gaseous chlorine into the molten aluminum.  Off-gassing from this process is collected and vented through an abatement device which neutralizes and collects any residual chlorine and its reaction products.  Other than chlorine, the Facility uses no other chemicals that USEPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, i.e., regulated under USEPA's RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe Facility accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help the Facility effectively manage the hazards that are posed to the employees, the public"

These management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n*  Process safety information\n\n*  Process hazard analysis\n\n*  Operating procedures\n\n*  Training\n\n*  Mechanical integrity\n\n*  Management of change\n\n*  Pre-startup review\n\n*  Compliance audits\n\n*  Incident investigation\n\n*  Employee participation\n\n*  Hot work permit\n\n*  Contractor management\n\n\n\nThese individual prevention program elements work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  The Company and the employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way business is conducted including accident prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThis Facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years resulting in either injuries, death or evacuation of businesses or homes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility has developed an emergency response plan.  This Plan provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the Facility plan is coordinated with the local emergency response providers. \n\n\n\nThe Facility emergency response plan covers the following emergency scenarios:\n\n* Bomb Threat\n\n* Suspicious Package\n\n* Chlorine Release\n\n* Earthquake\n\n* Flood\n\n* Molten Metal Incident\n\n* Chemical/Oil Spill and Release (other than chlorine)\n\n* Radioactivity Detection in Received Scrap Material\n\n* Severe Weather\n\n* Fire\n\n* Injury \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are planned at the Facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* No improvements are currently planned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
