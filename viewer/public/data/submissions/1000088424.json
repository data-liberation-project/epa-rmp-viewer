The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system located at the Whole Foods Distribution Center400 E. Johnson Ave., Cheshire, CT.  Whole Foods has enacted both the Process Safety Management Program and the Risk Management Program as part of their dedication to the health and safety of their employees, as well as the additional community and public receptors.  The only regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  \n\nThis facility is a warehousing distribution center with cold storage capabilities.  The refrigeration system encompasses three separate ammonia machinery rooms, and has a combined inventory of approximately 16,198 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored on site.  This process meets the requirements of EPA's Program 3.\n\nThis Process Safety Program Manual has been developed by HCG Associates on behalf of the Whole Foods Distribution Center, specifically to prevent or mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at the Cheshire facility. As noted in specific sections, portions of this Plan, including technical details associated with anhydrous ammonia operations were prepared by the American Refrigeration Company, Andover, MA. This manual was developed to meet the requirements of both the OSHA Process Safety Management Program, and the Risk Management Program regulations and is available to government agencies and the public for review.\n\nWhole Foods. operates the 155,000-sq"
