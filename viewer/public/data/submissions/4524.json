      "SummaryText": "          1.  The Facility Policy\n               The management and employees of Southern Valley Co-op are committed to the prevention of any\n               accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is \n               prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and to\n               minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n          2.  Facility Information\n               The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n               Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for application to farmers. Anhydrous\n               ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000\n               lbs. in our storage tank and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading\n               of a truck tank holding 40,000 lbs.\n\n          3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n               a. The worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total \n               contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released\n               would be 130,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent \n               capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\n               ppm.) is 1.12 miles.\n               b. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia based on the hazard review is a 2\n               minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to \n               200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n           4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n               The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\n               of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6"

The Five-year Accident History\n                There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years: That have\n                caused and deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor to our knowledge\n                have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n            6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n                 The facility has:\n                 a. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\n                 b. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n                 information as required under SARA Title lll (EPCRA)\n                 c. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n            7.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n                 Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to\n                 assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n                 recommendations at this time.\n\n                 For further information contact Mark Wels- Safety Director at (507) 387-2769"
