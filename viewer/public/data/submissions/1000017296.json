(6)An adequate means of securing both ends of the supply hose during transportation.  At any time you can get a hard copy of an Anhydrous Ammonia MSDS at our office from our most current supplier.  Also on file at the office is a detail procedure of unloading an Anhydrous Ammonia rail car and the loading of nurse tanks.  With safety our number 1 issue we keep these copies only in the office.

      "SummaryText": "Superior Fertilizer Company is a small independently owned company in NE Colorado.  Superior has been in business serving our area Farmers and Ranchers for the past 37 years. Anhydrous ammonia is one of the Agriculture fertilizers that we sell to our Agriculture customers ONLY.  With the increase of Fertilizer prices we have seen our Anhydrous Ammonia sales stay constant compared to 5 years ago we saw a drop in our sales. SAFETY is still our #1 issue with our employees and our community.  Superior is updating our Risk Management Plan as described in EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations at 40 CFR Part 68.  Superior keeps at its location at 401 2nd Avenue, Crook, CO a 18,000 Gallon liquid cylinder tank for Anhydrous Ammonia.  The tank has a light reflective coating of paint.  The tank has the words Anhydrous Ammonia on both sides of the tank in lettering 4 inches high.  Also on the sides of the tank are Inhalation Hazard in 2 inch lettering.  All of the valves to this tank are fenced off and are also locked up at all times, unless it is in use.  Also there are signs on the fence that say Keep Out, Authorized Personnel Only and Dangerous, Eye Protection Must Be worn In The Area.  Our Safety relief valve is covered at all times to protect it from the elements.  Superior installed Emergency Shut-Off valves on June 1, 2002.  The emergency Shut-Off valves are in compliance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), K61.1-1999, Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Sections 5.10.8.1 and 5.10.8.2.  By installing the Emergency Shut-Off valve this addresses our biggest potential for human error or equipment malfunction that could cause an accidental release.  We are able to shut off the flow of Anhydrous from a remote location if we are unloading a rail car or loading a nurse tank.  Another safety precaution that Superior has is to not overfill nurse tanks.  We try to put an average of 85% per tank.  The State of"

Respond time most likely would be less than 5 minutes.  The closest fire hydrant is 700 ft from our Anhydrous plant.  Superior Fertilizer holds annual rehearsals of our Emergency Action Plan to keep employees up on changes in our facility, policies and procedures.

On our yearly hazard review that the General Manager does we have a Safety Meeting and we go over the Hazard review check list which involves but is not limited to the following: (1) The Anhydrous compressor (2) Housekeeping around the plant (3) Security locks and fence repairs if needed (4) Dates on the Anhydrous hoses (5) Hydrostatic (liquid) relief valve (6) Compressor safety (vapor) relief valve (7) Safety equipment (a) Anhydrous gloves (b) Anhydrous goggles &copy; Water Hydrant and shower in working order (d) Full face mask with Anhydrous cartridges (e) Protective boots (f) Protective slicker and protective pants and jacket.
