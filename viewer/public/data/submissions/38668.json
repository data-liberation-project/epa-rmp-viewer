      "SummaryText": "The Noveon plant in Louisville, Kentucky is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in the Rubbertown area.  A portion of this plant, along with several in the vicinity, began operation in 1942 as a government-owned synthetic rubber facility.  Thus, the name Rubbertown was established.\n\nFrom 1942 until February, 2001, the current Noveon facility was owned and operated by The BFGoodrich Company.  Today, the facility operates as an integral part of Noveon International, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Lubrizol Company. Over 100 different products are produced at the Louisville facility.  The latex unit supplies products consumed in paper coatings, automotive interiors, and non-woven cloth applications.  The facility is the world's largest producer of CPVC resins and compounds which are consumed in the manufacture of plumbing, fire sprinker and industrial piping systems.  \n\nThe plant utilizes five chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Mangement Program RMP Rule.  These are vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, which are regulated as flammables, and chlorine, vinyl acetate and 28% aqueous ammonia solution, which are regulated as toxics.  The systems required by the RMP to prevent serious accidents and to plan contingencies have long been in place at this facility.  The relationship between excellent chemical safety programs and good business is well understood in the Noveon organization and is a core value in our operation.  The RMP initiative provides us with an additional opportunity to expand our ongoing dialog with the community.\n\nThe Noveon Louisville facility is committed to conducting operations in a manner that protects the surrounding community,  the environment and our employees.  We are fully compliant with applicable laws and regulations, the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care initiatives and Noveon Health, Safety and Environmental Policies.\n\nThe Noveon Louisville facility has a comprehensive program for process safety manageme"

These systems are consistent with and fully compliant with the  elements established in  OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, 1910.119.   Some highlights of the program include:  \n1)  Employee Participation - Employees with various areas of expertise are involved in numerous activities to continuously improve plant safety systems and results.  Key areas include safety committees, audits, pre-startup safety reviews, process hazard analyses, trainig, procedure development and safety meetings.\nHazards associated with plant processes.  Recommendations are developed and implemented following evaluation.  PHA's are updated a minimum of every 5 years.  \n3)  Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for all plan processes to ensure safe operation.  These are updated as required and are reviewed annually for correctness.  \n4)  Employee Training - An operating training program has been established to train, test, and qualify employees involved in operating the chemical processes.  The program is includes plant-specificg, process-specific  and job specific training.  All employees have completed this program and are requalified every three years.  \n5)  Mechanical integrity - The resin area follows a comprehensive mechanical integrity program for equipment in chlorine service.  Elements of this program include inspections and tests at prescribed frequencies and documentation thereof, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel.  \n6)  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews - Reviews are conducted of new processes, major projects and new chemicals to ensure safe transition into the operating mode.  \n7)  Hot Work Permit - The plant follows a long-standing system to manage potential sources of ignition.  \n8)  Management of Change -  A system is in place to properly manage changes that are not replacement-in-kind.  \n9)"

      "SummaryText": "Contractors - Contract companies are evaluated to ensure they have the appropriate job skills, knowledge training and certifications to perform work saffely.  All contract personnel must complete a Noveon Louisville-specific training class prior to entering the facility and annually thereafter.  \n10)  Incident Investigation -  All incidents or near-miss incidents involving the release of hazardous chemicals are investigated by a multi-functional team of plant personnel including those involved in operating the process.  These reviews involve a critique of the incident and any related plant systems.  Corrective actions are developed and tracked to completion.  A report documenting these reviews is developed and circulated throughout this facility  and to other Noveon locations.  \n11)  Compliance Audits -  Internal audits of our process safety management systems are conducted by Noveon personnel every three years.    These audits review all systems and documentation thereof, verify process safety information and inspect the physical facilities.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that each company include a five year history of of all accidental releases of RMP-regulated chemicals that resulted in deaths, injuires, significant property damage on-site; know off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  The Noveon Louisville plant has had no events that meet this criteria.\n\nThe Noveon Louisville facility has an emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Lake Dreamland Fire Department, the Rubbertown Mutual Aid Association, and other local response agencies. Plant personnel are trained annually on the plan and new employees are trained prior to working in a process area.  All operations personnel for the plant processes involving RMP-covered chemicals maintain 24-Hour Hazardous Material Technician certification to mitigate an accidental release.  \n\nPersonal a"

Improvement of these systems is an ongoing focus of each plant employee and is incorporated into such forums as incident investigations, process hazard analyses, capital project reviews and safety committees.  Specific improvements are planned to expand monitoring capability in the latex area over the next twelve months.  In addition, the process controls for all plant manufacturing areas will be scrutinized for improvement opportunities as a part of planned upgrades to the distributive control systems."
