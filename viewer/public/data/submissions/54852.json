      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\n\nCucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD) has a well-established policy for the safe management of hazardous chemicals at the Lloyd W. Michael Water Treatment Plant.  CVWD recognizes that the keys to chemical safety are safe system design, well-trained operations and supervisory staff, and tested emergency action procedures (Emergency Action Plan).  The CVWD General Manager has oversight responsibility for development and implementation of District\u00bfs safety and emergency preparedness programs. \n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Lloyd Michael Treatment Plant (LMTP) is a facility which treats raw water to produce drinking water for storage and distribution to a multi-city service area.  A critical element of the treatment process is the addition of chlorine for water purification and water quality improvement.  Chlorine is stored at the facility as a pressurized gas in DOT-approved one-ton metal containers.  This is the only EPA Regulated Substance used at the facility. \n\n\nRelease Scenarios \n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  The release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThis facility complies with the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) Rule as it applies to chlorine storage and use. All operators and supervisors are trained in chlorine safety.  All operators are state-certified water treatment plant operators.  Routine equipment and process status inspection and testing is conducted by operations staff, who also are trained to perform routine maintenance.  Periodic preventive maintenance of critical systems is conducted by specialists in chlorine equipment and instrumentation.  The plant is monitored from a central computer control unit, which provides operations status and alarm display"

      "SummaryText": "s, including process area chlorine detectors. The computer and instrumentation systems are backed up by battery-powered supply, and the overall plant electrical systems are backed up by an emergency generator, allowing chlorine vapor scrubbers to operate in the event of line power failure. \n\n\nFive-year Accident History \n\nThere has been no release of the covered chemical in the past five years. \n\n\nEmergency Action Program \n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan is submitted to the San Bernardino County Fire Dept. and coordinated with the Rancho Cucamonga Fire Dept. as a local emergency responder.  All operators receive initial and annual refresher (HAZWOPER) training in emergency response, and are trained to respond to minor chlorine leaks if they should occur.  The facility maintains an emergency action team and incident command structure, including in- plant alarms and public notification procedures. \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted for this facility included recommendations to examine specific equipment and monitoring systems to determine if upgrades could improve the safety of the chlorine systems under unusual conditions (e.g., earthquakes, multiple component failures).  All recommendations will be reviewed and considered for implementation."
