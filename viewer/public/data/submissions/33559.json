The only substances at the Paslode plant that are subject to RMP requirements are the listed flammable chemicals 1-butene and propylene. A mixture of these chemicals is stored in two 6,000 gallon tanks and is used as the fuel in fuel cells produced at the Paslode plant. An RMP addressing these substances was submitted to MDEQ and USEPA in January 2003.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nPaslode is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Paslode?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nPaslode is subject to 112(r) because 1-butene and propylene gas, are regulated substances, and are present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  \n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nAs specified by the RMP rule, Paslode has performed the required off-site consequence analyses for both the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios.  \nAdministrative controls and mitigation measures include: alarms, relief valves, backup pumps, check valves, manual shutoffs, interlocks, and automatic shutoffs. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n1-butene and propylene gas\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of  1-butene and propylene gas, Paslode has implemented several precautionary measures.  Paslode has evaluated the system"

Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of 1-butene and propylene gas are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs and electrical distribution system grounding).\n\nPaslode has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the technology, the equipment and the facility.  Paslode encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Paslode, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nDuring the past five years, the Paslode facility located in Pontotoc, Mississippi has not had an incident involving the release of flammable substances that caused injuries, death, significant property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPaslode has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled Emergency Evacuation Plan in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site hazardous substance release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Paslode as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Paslode?s emergency response procedures, Paslode will provide copies of this and future major revisions for review by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Address follows:  \nPontotoc County LEPC\nPO Box 109\nAlgoma, MS  38820-0109\nRicky Jaggers,  EMA Director   662-489-1637"
