The facility is located at 8805 North Tabler Road. Equistar employs approximately 550 full time employees at the plant site.  There is collocated a research facility with about 60 employees.\n\n1.0      ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES: \n\nEquistar is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Equistar has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Morris Plant. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant, and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule); and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Morris Plant consists of the following four elements:\n\n7 A Management system to oversee implementation of the RMP elements.\n\n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n\n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n\n7 An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describin"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  To effectively implement these policies, Equistar has established a management system headed by the Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Departments to oversee safety and environmental-related activities.\n\n1.1     Policy on the use of hazardous substances:\nBefore using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, Equistar considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect the plant workers, the public and the environment through the management of change and the process hazard analysis processes and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\n1.2     Preventing accidental releases of the hazardous substances:\nEquistar is committed to the safety of workers, the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Equistar implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, installation and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed b"

In addition, Equistar requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the management of change process. Equistar's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.  The Morris Plant also participates in auditing processes to measure and enhance its prevention program.\n\n1.3     Minimizing impact from an accidental release:\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Morris Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Equistar provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies. Equistar trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Equistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Northeast Illinois Area Industry Mutual Aid Association.\n\n1.4     Community Participation: \nThe Morris Plant actively participates in and is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care. initiative.  As part of Equistar 's Responsible Care. efforts, the Morris Plant has voluntarily been involved in a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) since November 1992.

Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.  \n\n\n2.0     STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEquistar's Morris Plant is located on an 890-acre site and began operations in 1968. The stationary source consists of an ethylene, polyethylene, and polypropylene process areas and support facilities. The following facilities (processes) are covered by this Rule: Olefins unit, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) unit, Polypropylene (PP) unit, Linear Low Density (LLDPE) unit, and the Process Research Center (PRC).  The Morris Plant's key products are ethylene, propylene, low-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene and polypropylene with by-products of hydrogen, crude butadiene and aromatic gasoline.  The feedstocks used are ethane and propane. All feedstocks arrive at the facility by pipeline and railcar.  Aromatic gasoline is transported by pipeline to our river property dock where it is loaded into barges for transportation.\n\n\n3.0      WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nThe Morris Plant handles several regulated toxic and flammable substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule. The Morris Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario \" (WCS) and an \"alternative release scenario\" (ARS) for each toxic and one to represent all flammables.   In reality, Equistar does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios were developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. \n "

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change review.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change review to ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n4.7     Pre-startup Review\n\nThe Morris Plant performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.

Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's safe work practices orientation.\n\n4.12     Contractors\n\nThe Morris Plant established a program to ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors' train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker can begin work at the plant site.
