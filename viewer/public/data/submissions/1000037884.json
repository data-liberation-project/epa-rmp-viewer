      "SummaryText": "Sturtevant Regional Distribution Center\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Sturtevant facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 2600 Enterprise Drive, Sturtevant, Racine County, Wisconsin. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by SC Johnson & Son (SC Johnson). SC Johnson is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin. \n                                                                                                                                                                          \nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations. Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. In addition, isopentane, contained in aerosol shave gel product formulas, is also present in quantities above the RMP reporting threshold. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant and isopentane weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process. \n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond the warehouse property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also been no prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts.\n\nEmergency response activities at the facility are coordinated with the South Shore Fire Department."
