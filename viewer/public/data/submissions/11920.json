      "SummaryText": "1.  Overview\n\nThis plan was developed to meet the EPA Requirements contained in 40 CFR, part 68 for International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) facility located in Augusta, GA.  The IFF facility is 3 years old and began production in 1996.  This facility is in the Aroma Chemical business and processes raw materials into base products that are later used in blending perfumes, house hold products, and a multitude of other products requiring a scent or fragrance.  This facility is working toward ISO certification and operates under the guidelines identified in OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) due to the flammability and toxicity of some raw materials used in the processes.\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nIn this production facility, flammable raw materials in excess of 10,000 pounds (Acetaldehyde) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) (a listed hazardous chemical) are used on a regular basis.  Precautions in the handling of these materials are necessary to prevent unnecessary human exposures and reduce the exposure threat to the employees and nearby members of the community.  Safety was emphasized in the design of this facility and specific operating/maintenance procedures are in place to minimize the risk to personnel from the materials used in the processes.  Training of personnel working in the process area is accomplished on a continuing basis.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.\n\nThe emergency response program has been developed and coordinated with local emergency response agencies.
