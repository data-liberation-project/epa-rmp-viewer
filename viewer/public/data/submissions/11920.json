      "SummaryText": "1.  Overview\n\nThis plan was developed to meet the EPA Requirements contained in 40 CFR, part 68 for International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF) facility located in Augusta, GA.  The IFF facility is 3 years old and began production in 1996.  This facility is in the Aroma Chemical business and processes raw materials into base products that are later used in blending perfumes, house hold products, and a multitude of other products requiring a scent or fragrance.  This facility is working toward ISO certification and operates under the guidelines identified in OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals) due to the flammability and toxicity of some raw materials used in the processes.\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nIn this production facility, flammable raw materials in excess of 10,000 pounds (Acetaldehyde) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) (a listed hazardous chemical) are used on a regular basis.  Precautions in the handling of these materials are necessary to prevent unnecessary human exposures and reduce the exposure threat to the employees and nearby members of the community.  Safety was emphasized in the design of this facility and specific operating/maintenance procedures are in place to minimize the risk to personnel from the materials used in the processes.  Training of personnel working in the process area is accomplished on a continuing basis.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations.\n\nThe emergency response program has been developed and coordinated with local emergency response agencies.  The emergency response plan (ERM-01 dated March 1999) is also tested on a regular basis.  The emergency response plan includes procedure for the notification of local fire and rescue authorities as well as procedures to notify any potentially affected neighbors in the event of a spill or other incidents at the facility.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "mary purpose of this facility is to manufacture aroma chemicals used in the fragrance industry.  The facility currently uses two raw materials that fall under OSHA's process safety and EPA's risk management programs (SO2 and Acetaldehyde).  SO2 is received at the facility by rail car and the facility is equipped to transfer material from this rail car into process equipment.  Acetaldehyde is received by tanker truck and unloaded into a storage tank considered part of the process equipment.  Finished product is loaded and shipped from the facility by truck.  DOT containers are used to both receive raw materials and ship finished products.\n\nThe maximum amounts of covered chemicals that are stored at this facility are:\nSulfur Dioxide(SO2)   180,000 pounds\nAcetaldehyde               80,000 pounds\n\n4.  Worst-Case Release and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\nSee modeling results for worst-case release and alternative-case release scenarios.  Modeling results also indicate all public receptor areas that must be addressed by our emergency response procedures.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThis facility is less than five-years old.  There have been no reportable release from this facility since it began operations in 1996.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Richmond County Emergency Management Agency and the Richmond County Fire Department.  A representative of the Fire Department visited this facility upon start-up in 1996.\n\n7.  Hazard Review\n\nThe last process hazard analyses for this facility was completed on 3/16/95.  Recommendations were tracked until closed prior to start-up.  The next process hazard analyses for this facility is scheduled for 3/00.\n\nMajor hazards identified that apply to his facility include:  fire, explosion, overfilling, and potential equipment failures.  Process controls in use include:  relief valves, manual & automatic shutoff valves, grounding equipment, high level indi"
