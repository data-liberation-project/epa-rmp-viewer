      "SummaryText": "   At Akzo Nobel the concern for health, safety and the environment forms an integral part of our\nbusiness policy.  Our goal is to conduct  our activities in a manner that protects the health of our  \nemployees, the community and our customers. \n \n    We work diligently to prevent injuries associated with our  operations and those of our \ncontractors.  Whenever possible we try to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of our \nactivities by appropriate design, manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal practices. \n \n \nSelecting a Single \nWorst Case Accident Scenario \n \nThe  hazard assessment element of the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule requires the review of \nthe offsite effects from one worst case release scenario for all toxic  and flammable chemicals listed in \nthe RMP rule.  \n \nFirst, the list of regulated chemicals at the site is determined.  The LeMoyne Plant has two toxic   \nchemicals regulated by RMP, Chlorine and Carbon Disulfide. \n \nNext,  the EPA Look-Up Tables are used to estimate how large an area could be impacted by the worse case accidental release for the site. EPA has defined a worst case scenario as the  release of the largest quantity of a listed  chemical from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to the listed chemicals endpoint concentration in a ten minute period.  \n \nWorse Case Scenario Distances \n \nChlorine greater than 25 miles \n\n \n\nSelecting an \nAlternative Release Scenario \n \nEPA recognizes that  total failure of a tank or pipeline is rare; but accidents have and do  happen.  \nTo address this concern they require each site to look at its safety record of  handling and storage of \nthe RMP regulated material  and to analyze  more realistic scenarios. These two pieces of data are \ncalled the Alternative Release Scenarios and   the 5-Year Accident History. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios Distances \n \nChlorine                                        0.81 miles \nCarbon Disulfide                      "
