The Risk Management Program is based on the API Publication 761:  \"Model Risk Management Plan Guidance for Exploration and Production Facilities.\"\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Satanta Gas Plant are  included in the facility's Emergency Response Manual and PSM program. The Emergency Response Manual covers action to be taken in case of an unplanned release. The mechanical integrity section of PSM discusses action taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\n\nThe Satanta Gas Plant is a natural gas processing facility. The processing of the gas includes dehydration of the full gas stream followed by the removal of natural gas liquids, nitrogen and helium. The nitrogen removed is vented to the atmosphere. The helium recovered is compressed and transported via pipeline from the facility. The natural gas liquids, which consists of a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and hexanes, is transported via pipeline from the facility. The remaining gas, which consists mainly of methane, ethane and a small amount of propane and heavier components, is transported via pipeline from the facility.\n\nSatanta Gas Plant was determined to be a program level 1 facility through the worst-case scenario analysis.  The worst-case scenario for this facility would be a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) due to the instantaneous release of 204,000 pounds of natural gas liquid, NGL, from a temporary storage tank. The radius of exposure for this volume is 0.48 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors located in the radius of exposure.  In normal operation, only a small amount of NGL is stored in these tanks; however, from time to time, NGL is diverted to these tanks due to a malfunction on the pipeline where NGL is normally transported. During those infrequent times that NGL is dive"

      "SummaryText": "rted to these storage tanks, the level is frequently monitored by the on duty operators. This facility is attended 24 hours a day by a minimum of two operators. These tanks are protected by pressure safety valves to prevent the possibility of exceeding the safe operating pressure of these tanks.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention measures taken are outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility. Some of the main components of this section that would help prevent the accidental uncontrolled release of regulated substances include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of PSV's and routine testing of piping and vessel corrosion.\n\nThere has not been a recordable / off-site accident in the previous five year history of this facility. \n\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the Emergency Response Manual, ERM. The ERM include actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance, an uncontrollable fire and tornadoes. The proper action includes immediately contacting the Grant County Emergency Response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\n\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which unsafe items are discussed and resolved."
