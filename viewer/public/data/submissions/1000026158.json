In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the PSM/RM programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nOur PSM/RM programs contain the following major elements:\n\n\n\n?

The Ammonia Refrigeration system is used in the production process for removing heat from the process through plate and frame heat exchangers. There are no evaporators in the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration system at Buffalo Rock in Birmingham, Alabama consists of 16 piston compressors manufactured by Vilter with HP ranging from 75 to 150. The compressors are located in 4 mechanical rooms feeding a common header (HSD) with a common suction (HSS).  There is a master accumulator on the suction side of the system to prevent the possibility of carry over.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 evaporative condensers external to the building elevated at the 2nd floor mezzanine level providing heat removal for the compressed NH3 (v). At this point there is a high pressure receiver tank to act as a buffer for the NH3 (l) entering the HPL common header feeding the heat exchangers via surge drums.\n\n\n\nOn the process side of the system there are 5 plate and frame heat exchangers, 2 falling film heat exchangers and one shell & tube heat exchanger, all being fed by surge drums with level control. All surge drums have dual SRV's and are connected to relief headers exiting through roof penetrations (roof vents are elevated to 15 ft above roof line with weather caps). There are 2 Viking positive displacement pumps used to circulate NH3 (l)"

At Buffalo Rock in Birmingham, AL a failure of the high pressure liquid receiver located outside of the building next to the evaporative condensers would be considered a worst-case scenario if a failure were to occur. This vessel has a volume of 60 ft3 with a maximum of 50% liquid ammonia at any one time, making a total release of 1,115 lbs of ammonia.  With a release of this magnitude the Toxic Endpoint is approximately 0.62 miles, which means the vapor would travel approximately 0.62 miles before reaching the 0.14 mg/L (200 PPM) level which is considered a safe level. The probability of a failure in this vessel system is very low due to the following reasons:\n\n\n\n?    Industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels;\n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n?    Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel;\n\n?    PM, inspection, testing and replacement of equipment is done by a licensed contractor;\n\n?    Automated level control system with daily operational inspections;\n\n?    Alarms are in place to warn personnel of process upsets; and\n\n?    The emergency response plan and equipment at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Buffalo Rock involves the failure of one of the evaporative condensers with a total mass of 659 lbs of ammonia (see PSI Traking Log - Maximum Inventory Levels - Appendix I) at 150 psig. The total mass was used to compute the release quantity rather than guessing a possible rupture diameter (therefore the total mass was estimated to release in 10 minutes). The condenser is located outside and has no passive mitigation. The facility is located in a commercial area with numerous buildings and a residental neighberhood nearby. The same procedure as the Worst-Case Release Scenario will be used due to the total mas"
