      "SummaryText": "Famers Union Oil Co. of Bridgewater, SD is a registered Propane supplier. We own a 18,000 gallon stationary storage tank located on our property on the west edge of Bridgewater, SD. In this tank we store propane for the heating needs of our customers.\nWe have not had an accidental release of propane within the last five years. In fact we have not had an accidental release in our 56 year history. This is attributed to our accidnetal release prevention program. Our employees are trained to be aware of equipment maintance and proper operation proceedures to prevent accidents. Our plant is inspected yearly by our insurance carrier and also by the state of South Dakota. Any deficiencies, found by these inspections or our employees, are corrected immediately.\nOur Risk Management Plan was completed using government and industry standards for the accidental release and alternative release scenarios. We have an Emergency Response Plan in force coordinated with the Bridgewater Fire Department and the Local Emergency Action Plan Committee in conjuction with McCook County Civil Defense in Salem, SD.\nWe are constantly looking at changes in technology in the transfer of propane and upgrade our facilities when they come to the market."
