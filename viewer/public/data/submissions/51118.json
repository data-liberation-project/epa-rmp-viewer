This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n\tAcknowledge the operation of a source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the \u00bfgeneral duty clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n\tIdentify hazards\n\tDesign and maintain a safe facility\n\tPrevent releases\n\tMinimize consequences of releases.\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented risk management plan, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. YCEC has prepared and implemented its RMP of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\nThe RMP applies to the YCEC facility located at:\n\n875 North Walton Ave., Yuba City, CA. 95993\n\nThis RMP does not apply to the Greenleaf 2 facility, which is covered by a site specific RMP, which addresses anhydrous ammonia issues.\nThe YCEC facility is a gas turbine based peaking power plant facility rated at 48.1 MW (nominal rating). The facility will consist of one (1) LM6000-PC eSprint gas turbine rated at 48.1 MW. The gas turbine is equipped wit"

The facility has \u00bfselective catalytic reduction (SCR)\u00bf system, on the turbine, for the control of oxides of nitrogen (Nox) emissions. Aqueous ammonia (19 percent solution) is used as the reaction reagent in the presence of a precious metal catalyst to complete the Nox emissions control process. Aqueous ammonia is stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 12,000 gallons. Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site approximately twice a year.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored: Aqueous Ammonia 19% Solution (CAS# 7664417)\nFacility SIC: 4911\tNAICS Code: 221112\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0 respectively. A brief description of the prevention and emergency response policies is as follows.\n\nAccident Prevention Program Policies and Elements\nThe accident prevention program is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00bf\tInspection and maintenance program for all system equipment.\n\u00bf\tMonitoring of employee and contractor use of the system.\n\u00bf\tContractor Safety Program\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan\n\u00bf\tLockout/Tag out Procedures and Program\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit Program\n\u00bf\tConfined Space Entry Program\n\u00bf\tEmployee Safety Training Program\n\u00bf\tCompilation of substance information (MSDS)\n\u00bf\tPeriodic compliance audits.\n\nIntegral parts of the prevention program are the following plans: \nHazardous Materials Business Plan \u00bf Injury and Illness Prevention Plan \u00bf Spill Containment Control and Countermeasure Plan \u00bf Hazardous Waste Storage and Handling Procedures \u00bf Hazard Communication Program \u00bf Fire Protection and Prevention Plan \u00bf Hearing Conservation Program \u00bf Respiratory Conservation Program \u00bf Electrical Safety Program \u00bf Proposition 65 Compliance Program \u00bf Forklift and Industrial Truck Program \u00bf Welding, Cutting, an"

System pressures and flow rates will be monitored at the main plant control room console. \nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n\tProper maintenance of all system equipment.\n\tProper operation of all system equipment.\n\tInternal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n\tComprehensive personnel training.\n\tA written emergency response plan.\n\tA written hazardous materials management plan.\n\tDocumented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n\tInclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP.\nThe project has never experienced an accidental release of ammonia or any other hazardous substance in the last 5 years."
