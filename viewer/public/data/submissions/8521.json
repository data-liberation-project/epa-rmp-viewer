Collectively, these  prevention  program\nactivities  help prevent potential accident scenarios that  could\nbe caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nCFS has safety features on many units to help:\n     Contain/control a release,\n     Quickly detect a release, and\n     Reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\nThe  following types of safety features are used in  the  covered\nprocesses.\nl    Release detection:  Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\nl    Release  containment/control:  Process  relief  valves  that\n     discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n     Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n     Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g.,\n     high pressure and temperature).  Curbing or diking to contain\n     liquid releases.  Backup power equipment (e.g., 24-volt backup\n     power supply for process control system).  Atmospheric relief\n     devices.\n\n                                                 \n  Issue Date:    Revision Date:     Re"

This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\n\nThe RMP program at CFS consists of three (3) elements:\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand:\n          \n               The potential offsite consequences of hypothetical\n               accidental releases and;\n          l    accidents that have occurred during the last five (5) years\n               associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n               (regulated substances).\n          \n2)   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the\n     processes  containing more than a threshold  quantity  of  a\n     regulated substance (covered processes).\n3)   An  emergency response program to help respond to accidental\n     releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this\nRMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at CFS helps provide assurance that  the\nfacility is m"
