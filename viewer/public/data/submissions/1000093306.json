      "SummaryText": "Healthcare AZ, LLC (also known as MLILY) constructed a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility (Facility) located at 3350 N. Cotton Lane in Goodyear, Maricopa County, Arizona (Figure 1).  The Facility will begin operations in May 2021. MLILY will produce slabstock polyurethane foam by chemically reacting polyether polyols, diisocyanates, and minor additives. The cured foam will then be incorporated into foam mattresses. Processes at the Facility fall within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 326150, Urethane and Other Foam Product (except Polystyrene) Manufacturing. \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing process utilizes Mondur TD Grade A (TD80) as a raw material, generically referred to as Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The Facility comprises three (3) TDI storage tanks with a capacity of 4,490 gallons each. The tanks are located indoors on the west side of the Facility. TD80 contains 2,4-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,4-TDI, CAS # 584-84-9) and 2,6-Toluene Diisocyanate (2,6-TDI, CAS # 91-08-7). The threshold quantity (TQ) for these chemicals is 10,000 pounds (lbs). Due to the exceedance of the TQ, the Facility is required to have a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR 68. This RMP has been developed based on the worst-case scenario for each of the processes at the Facility per 40 CFR ?68.25. The Facility does not store or utilize any flammable chemicals in excess of the TQ.  \n\n\n\nProcess 1 is the TDI unloading process at the Facility. TDI will be delivered in tanker trucks to the west side of the building, where the TDI will be pumped directly into storage tanks via ports through the wall of the Facility (Figure 2). Sloped concrete would guide any TDI released during unloading to a drain directing spillage to a containment pit with a design capacity of 7,270 gallons. Tankers are expected to have a maximum capacity of 7,000 gallons, indicating the entire contents of a tanker would fit within the containment area. A worst-case release scenario for t"

      "SummaryText": "his process would be the release of the entire 7,000-gallon contents of a tanker. An analysis was performed in accordance with 40 CFR ?68.25, demonstrating that the toxic endpoint will not extend beyond the property and will not affect any public receptors. \n\n\n\nProcess 2 is the TDI storage process, which includes three (3) TDI storage tanks and associated piping. The worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of a storage tank with a full capacity of 4,490 gallons. These storage tanks are located indoors in a room on the west end of the building (Figure 2). The room itself provides containment in the event of an accidental release, and therefore, the liquid contents would be contained within the building. The worst-case release scenario analysis performed in accordance with 40 CFR ?68.25 indicates that the toxic endpoint will not extend beyond the property and will not affect public receptors. \n\n\n\nThe Facility is new; therefore, it has not had any accidental releases. As mentioned above, the distance to the toxic endpoint associated with a worst-case release is less than the distance to a public receptor. Finally, Healthcare AZ, LLC has coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations. Therefore, per 40 CFR ?68.10(f), the Facility meets the eligibility requirements for RMP Program 1.\n\n"
