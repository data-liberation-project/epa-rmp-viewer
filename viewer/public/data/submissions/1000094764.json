The facility has 280 employees.  Compania Cervecera is committed to comply with the environmental statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the beverage manufacturing operations.  Compania Cervecera operates a closed recirculation refrigeration system (the Cold Block Refrigeration System) that uses anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance listed pursuant to section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in an amount above the specified threshold quantity for that substance.  Compania Cervecera is subject to the Risk Management Plan Program in 40 CFR Part 68.\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nCompania Cervecera has implemented a prevention program for the covered process.  Hazard reviews have been conducted and updated to aid in the identification of hazards and to develop recommendations to prevent accidental releases.  Operators and maintenance personnel are trained on safety and release prevention work practices at least every three (3) years or more often, if necessary.  Operators and maintenance personnel are provided with written instructions regarding the operating, lock tag out and maintenance procedures of the refrigeration system.  Contractors working in or adjacent to the refrigeration system received training in hazards and safety work practices to prevent and protect from an ammonia release.\r\nThe facility conducts mechanical integrity tests to the equipment of the refrigeration system as required in the Risk Management Plan Program regulation.  Any incident or near miss's incident is investigated and recommendations to resolve them are implemented as soon as possible. \r\nFive Years Release History:\r\nIn the past five (5) years the refrigeration system has had no ammonia accidental release that caused offsite impacts.

      "SummaryText": "near miss incident due to the island wide power outage, the emergency generator failure to start up, and the increase in the pressure of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Due to the extreme weather conditions and the island wide power outage, the facility had no water supply, and, in the abundance of caution, Compania Cervecera requested a water tank truck from the Mayaguez Fire Department and activated the evacuation protocol.  Approximately 100 persons were evacuated to the Palacio de Recreacion y Deportes, the designated emergency shelter.  The refrigeration system release safety valves were not activated and there was not a release of ammonia.\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has an emergency action plan to respond to any fire(s) and/ or spill(s) and for a safe facility evacuation procedure.  In the year 2018, Compania Cervecera installed the community emergency alert system which will notify the evacuation procedures to follow in case of a major ammonia release. Compania Cervecera has coordinated emergency response drills that included the participation of the adjacent community, local emergency response agencies, and local hospitals, among others.  A private contractor specialized in emergency response emergencies provides periodic trainings to the facility emergency response team.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nA process hazard analysis and a training program have been developed and completed to manage the projected ammonia increase to be generated with the installation of additional fermentation tanks. Improvements to the Emergency Response Plan are being pursued.\r\n\r\nCompania Cervecera installed and operates a cogeneration system that improves and increased the facility's  electric power capacity to respond to an ammonia release emergency in case of an atmospheric disturbance."
