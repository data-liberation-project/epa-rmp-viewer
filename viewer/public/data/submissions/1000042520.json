An active PSM program is established and maintained.  \r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and the production, storage and handling of aqua ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used in processing mixed fertilizers and aqua ammonia while the aqua ammonia is produced, stored and then distributed to farmers for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.  The Program Level for both the anhydrous storage and the aqua production processes were upgraded to a Level 3 to further comply with the RMP regulations.  Previous Level 2 programs were used because of the interpolation of the use of ammonia in the batch mixing facility (OSHA exemption).  A portable pipe reactor is also operated on site on occasion.  This unit is subject to OSHA-PSM and all documentation for that unit is generated and maintained by the contractor.  Ouachita Fertilizer reviews and monitors the contractors PSM documentations and records.  \r\n\r\n3.
