Introduction\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Nation Pizza Products, LP (Nation Pizza Products) facility located at 1144 Bridger Court in McPherson, Kansas, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00b7Introduction;\n\u00b7Nation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7Hazard Assessment;\n\u00b7Prevention Program;\n\u00b7Five-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7Emergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7Emergency Communications;\n\u00b7Spill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00b7Planned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7Management Program\n\nII.

Facility Identification\nThe Nation Pizza Products facility is located at 1144 Bridger Court in McPherson, Kansas.  The facility is a producer of custom and branded frozen sandwiches and dough related products for food marketers and manufacturers, the food service industry, and retailers in the United States. \n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 31141. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating sandwich ingredients and products. \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system is approximately 17,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The \u00bfultra low pressure\u00bf equipment contains two (2) blast freezer evaporators with two (2) surge drums, one (1) ultra low temperature accumulator (ULTA-1) with transfer vessel and oil pot, and two (2) booster compressors.
