This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Armstrong Gas Plant located in DeWitt County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Hydrocarbons, LL C and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe Armstrong Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a two-train cryogenic natural gas liquid recovery plant, a gas dew point control unit, and natural gas liquids fractionation equipment.  The natural gas liquid recovery units are designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, and are assembled primarily from prefabricated, skid-mounted process components.   The dew point unit utilizes a simple refrigeration process to remove a smaller portion of heavier alkanes from the gas stream.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from gas gathering systems and inlet gas pipelines.  The plant processes the gas utilizing a cryogenic turbo expander to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas, or through refrigeration in the dew point control unit.  These mixed hydrocarbon liquid streams are fractionated at the Armstrong facility into individual, purified ethane, propane, mixed butane and pentane-plus natural gas liquid streams.  Fini"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Armstrong Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and mixed pentanes.  Armstrong Plant operating technicians also attend a natural gas treating plant located across a two-lane highway from the liquid extraction, fractionation and hydrocarbon liquid storage facilities.  This gas treating plant handles naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures which are exempt from the RMP regulation. Liquid gas condensate is also stored at the location, but is also a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture and is exempt from the RMP regulation.  Ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the facility for tank truck odorizing use, but is kept below the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation. The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\n  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Armstrong Gas Plant.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Armstrong Gas Plant conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.
