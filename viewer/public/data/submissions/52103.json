The program must consist of a hazard assessment, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. Additionally, the operator must describe the site's risk management program in a risk management plan (RMP). However, the regulation provides for three different programs of compliance dependent upon eligibility criteria of covered processes including, but not limited to, the potential impact of chemical release as identified in the hazard assessment. For example, chemical processes which meet the criteria for program level 1 and program level 2 have very minimal requirements for release prevention programs and emergency response as compared to those for program level 3.\n\nAt General Chemical - Bay Point Works, four listed chemicals are managed on site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria. No chemicals are managed on site under program 1 or program 2 criteria. The chemicals managed according to program level 3 include Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia (>20%), Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid(>30%). As identified in this plan, Bay Point Works is in compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 68 for management of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and Hydrochloric Acid.\n\nThis RMP describes Bay Point Work's risk management program, which includes hazard assessment, release prevention program and emerge"

Both the liquid loading line and the vapor recovery line are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia liquid is introduced into the manufacturing process by first passing it through a steam heated vaporizer to form ammonia gas.  This is the same vaporizer that is utilized in the Ammonium Fluoride Manufacturing Process.  This gas is used in the manufacture of 29% aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution. The 29% ammonium hydroxide solution is produced by filling a stainless steel reactor with high purity deionized water. Ammonia gas is filtered and then sparged through the water forming the aqueous ammonia. The gases are continually added until the desired concentration of 29% is achieved. The ammonium hydroxide solution is circulated through a heat exchanger/cooler in order to maintain a low reaction temperature. The aqueous ammonia reactor is equipped with a pressure relief valve and a vent scrubber that is in operation whenever the system is operating.\n\nSection 5.0 - Process Description for Ammonium Fluoride Manufacturing\n\nThe ammonium fluoride manufacturing process is supplied with Anhydrous Ammonia from the same storage tank previously referenced in the ammonium hydroxide manufacturing process. Anhydrous Ammonia is delivered to Bay Point Works by tank truck and pumped into a 12,000-gallon storage tank. A vapor recovery line is connected between the tank truck and the storage tank in order to recover any displaced Anhydrous Ammonia vapors. Both the liquid unloading line and the vapor recovery line are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia liquid is introduced into the manufacturing process by first passing through a steam heated vaporizer forming ammonia gas.

Rail cars are pressurized with nitrogen and unloaded into a purge pot to be sampled. Following laboratory approval, the railcar is unloaded into one of two Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride storage tanks. The Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride reactor is charged by the pressurization of the storage tanks with air to deliver material into the reactor. Once in the reactor, the Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride is treated and steam heated. Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride vapors enter the absorption column and are scrubbed with deionized water, forming electronic grade hydrofluoric acid (49-70%).
