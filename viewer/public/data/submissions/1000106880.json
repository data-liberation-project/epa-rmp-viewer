The partially vaporized ammonia (liquid/vapor mixture) is returned to the High Temp LPR.\n\nThe high temperature recirculated liquid from the High Temp LPR experiences a pressure drop as it flows through the motorized valve or the hand expansion valve prior to entering the Low Temp LPR. The Low Temp LPR then pumps low temperature recirculated liquid to five evaporator coils within the FPS Freezer.  \n\nThe FPS Freezer consists of a pre-cool coil and five freezer coils. The precool coil receives high temp recirculated liquid from the High Temp LPR, while the five freezer coils receive low temp recirculated liquid from the Low Temp LPR. The liquid within the coils partially vaporizers as it absorbs heat from the product (potatoes or blueberries) passing through the unit. The wet suction (liquid/vapor mixture) from the precool coil returns to the High Temp LPR, while the wet suction from the freezer coils returns to the Low Temp LPR. \n\nFreezer coils #1-4 within the FPS Freezer also receive hot gas from the compressors for coil defrost. Coil defrost is sequential (one coil at a time) and occurs based on programming within the control panel for the FPS Freezer. Defrost of freezer coil #5 occurs when the FPS Freezer is shut down for cleaning. Defrost for the pre-cool coil is not necessary (frost/ice accumulation on the coil is not expected as the coil operates at a higher pressure/temperature).\n\nThe pressure/temperature of the High Temp LPR and Low Temp LPR is maintained by the compressors, which draw suction from the vessels.

The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure. Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP and trained in the evacuation procedure.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the trained personnel will investigate the issue and contact the fire department for assistance as needed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA Process Hazard Analysis was performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and the evaluation resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.

The condensing process is facilitated by water that is sprayed on the condenser coils and air drawn over the coils by the condenser fans. The resulting high pressure ammonia liquid drains back to the High Pressure Receiver to be re-used in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Auto Purger which removes non-condensables in the system (air and water).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nTrinity Frozen Foods has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the EPA RMP regulation.

This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Trinity Frozen Foods has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition. All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nTrinity Frozen Foods is located at 6064 Deep Branch Road in Pembroke, North Carolina.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility\u2019s refrigeration system.  The system is used to freeze food products (potatoes and blueberries).  The system uses a maximum of 13,000 pounds of ammonia. A description of how the refrigeration system operates is as follows.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the evaporative condensers to the High Pressure Receiver. The High Pressure Receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the compressors SC-1 \u2013 SC-4 as liquid injection for oil cooling purposes. Liquid in the High Pressure Receiver is also fed to the High Temperature Low Pressure Recirculator (High Temp LPR).  \n\nPrior to entering the High Temp LPR, the high pressure liquid experiences a pressure drop as it flows through the motorized valve or the hand expansion valve of the liquid feed assembly.
