Fresno has developed a safety program that is carefully coordinated with the local emergency response management agencies. Safety programs are administered by qualified professional staff and emphasize employee involvement.\n\n2.0 Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Darling Fresno Facility renders animal waste by-products.  The finished products (i.e., meat and bone meal, tallow and yellow grease) are stored in silos.  The plant typically operates for 24 hours/day between Monday afternoon and Saturday afternoon on a weekly basis.  The capacity of the plant is 4 million lbs of rendered products per week.\n\nThis facility uses chlorine for odor control related to the processing of rendered animal products. Odorous air from the facility is vented through a scrubber system to oxidize and remove the molecules contributing to the foul odor before discharge to the atmosphere.  Two independent packed tower systems are used to accomplish this process.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored is:\nChlorine    8,000 lbs.\n\n3.0 Release Scenarios\n\n3.1 Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is defined as an uncontrolled indoor release from a completely full chlorine cylinder.  This can occur during replacement of the empty chlorine cylinder with a full cylinder and the ?o? ring is not seated properly during the hook-up. A release from a faulty ?O?-Ring in the vacuum regulator of the chlorine cylinder would result in a leak when the cylinder valve is open.  If the ?O?-Ring seating is not adjusted or the ring replaced upon detection of the leak, it is possible that chlorine leakage will occur until the cylinder is empty, releasing potentially up to 2,000 lbs of chlorine.\n\nThe rate of release is limited due to the small area available f"

      "SummaryText": "or the leak.  Since the release will occur indoors, the rate of release to the outdoors will be reduced by containment within the building. A few hours may be required to empty one cylinder.  Although this is a credible scenario, it can be circumvented by paying proper attention during replacement of the vacuum regulator and use of ammonia to detect leaks on a periodic basis.\n\n3.2 Alternative Release Scenarios\n \nReplacing the chlorine tubing with incompatible material or accidentally puncturing the chlorine tubing may result in release of a small quantity of chlorine from the tubing.  Chlorine release will occur only when the system is inactive and the volume of release is the volume of the tubing.  At the Fresno Facility the volume of the tubing is estimated at 0.1 ft3.  The release should be completed within a few minutes.  The release was assumed to occur outdoors since a portion of the vacuum tubing in the 100,000 cfm scrubber is located outside the building.\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDarling International ? Fresno has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.  A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance. A ?Safety Policies and Procedures Manual? is used as a reference guide and all appropriate employees are trained using the manual. The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the safety program at this site. Process hazard analyses are conducted prior to startup of major project installations, and then on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.\n\n5.0 Five-year accident history\n\nIn the five-year period from June 1, 1999 to May 30, 2004 there were no off-site releases of regulated substances exceeding reporting requirements\n\n6.0 Emergency response"

      "FacilityID": 35277,
      "SummaryText": " program\n\nThe Darling Fresno Facility has an existing ?Emergency Response/Evacuation Plan.?  The plan is part of the Safety Policies and Procedures Manual. The objective of the ?Emergency Response/Evacuation Plan? is to provide a method for effectively responding to a chlorine release in order to minimize injuries, lessen impact in the community, minimize plant damage, and provide guidance to local emergency response personnel. All employees involved in any level of emergency response are trained in the proper procedures for safely responding to a release. The Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the emergency response plan. The Plant Manager is also responsible for keeping the plan current and insuring that all employees are properly trained. Training shall be based on the duties and function to be performed by each responder.  The skill and knowledge levels required for all new responders, those hired after the effective date of this standard, are conveyed to them through training before they are permitted to take part in actual emergency operations of an incident. In plant emergency response exercises are conducted once per quarter. Emergency response exercises are conducted with the local LEPC annually.\n\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety\n\nDarling International ? Fresno is in the process of removing the chlorine odor control system. When the removal is complete there will be no pressurized chlorine stored on site and Darling will no longer be subject to RMP/PSM regulations."
