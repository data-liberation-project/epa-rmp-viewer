Description of Facility:  This facility is a retail farm supplier.  We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers for the purpose of crop production.  On site we have bulk storage of anhydrous ammonia as well as application storage tanks.  These tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% of their capacity to allow for product expansion.  This facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs to minimize the chances of an accident occurring. \n\n3. Worst Case Scenario: Not Listed.  Alternate Scenario:  Not listed.\n \n4. Accident Release Prevention Program:  This facility strives to comply with EPA\u00bfs accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  This facility is annually inspected by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.  All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and facility.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place from this facility.\n\n6. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Clarion Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Fire Department. We have also coordinated with the Region V Hazmat office in Fort Dodge regarding inclusion of our facility in their Regional Hazmat Response Plan.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvem"
