      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Loveland, Colorado (City) takes a very active approach in  maintaining and\nimproving chemical safety.  The City has demonstrated its  commitment to safety by\nupgrading the chemical feed process at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in early 1999\nfrom a gas pressure system to a vacuum system mounted directly on chlorine cylinders,\nwhich decreases system maintenance dramatically and therefore reduces the potential\nfor chlorine leaks.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe City's WTP is located northwest of the City at 3152 Waterdale.  Chlorine is used at the\nfacility to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  Chlorine is stored in one-ton cylinders,\nand no more than eight cylinders of chlorine (16,000 pounds) are stored at the WTP.\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst case release scenario involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine  from a\nsingle cylinder of chlorine outside of any enclosure.  The rule for worst  case release\nanalysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes.  The alternative case\nrelease scenario was based on process hazard analysis, and involves the release of\n600 pounds of chlorine in 60 minutes as a result of a fusible plug failure.  The distance to\nendpoint for both scenarios was analyzed using RMP*Comp (an EPA program), and the\nanalyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles and an\nalternative case release scenario distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for  Program\nLevel 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program\nbased on the written operating procedures for the WTP, as well as an aggressive\nmaintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered\nprocess.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintende"

      "SummaryText": "d releases of\nchlorine.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has had one accidental release of chlorine within the last five years.  The\naccidental release was caused by human error after removal of the old pressurized feed\nsystem, and resulted in a release of less than one pound of chlorine and a worker\nseeking medical evaluation.  The accidental release did not result in an offsite impact.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the\nprimary responder to the WTP is the City of Loveland Fire Department.  WTP employees\nhandle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety is an ongoing process. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs and inspections which are performed regularly at this facility.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. The City demonstrated this by upgrading the chemical process from a pressure system to a vacuum system in early 1999. This system reduces the potential for chlorine leaks and decreases system maintenance.\n\nOne development that resulted from our hazard review is to install a chlorine detection alarm in the feed area to improve the safety at our facility. This will be accomplished in 2000. The existing chlorine detection system in the storage room will be upgraded. This system will provide a digital readout indicating the concentration of chlorine and greatly improving safety and how the employee responds to the situation."
