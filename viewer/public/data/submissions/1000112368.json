This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\nTo save lives.\nTo minimize and avoid injuries.\nTo protect the environment.\nTo minimize property damage.\nFPL Food Offsite Freezer facility maintains an emergency (safety) committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\nThis Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nFPL Food Offsite Freezer facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse.\nThe refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For\nexample, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum\n(approximately 6\" Hg) on t"

In addition, FPL Food Offsite Freezer has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation since May 20, 1999.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nFPL Food Offsite Freezer has an Emergency Action Program in place. The facility has personnel that are trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis. All are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\nDuring the RMP Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures. In addition, it was recommended that the facility contact the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nDuring the review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the FPL Food Offsite Freezer facility located at 533 Laney-Walker Blvd. in Augusta, GA..\nThese action items were included in a management system and addressed.\nIn addition to the equipment related mitigation measures recommended to improve safety at this facility, the RMP Team made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety. These recommendations are a result of the review of the PSM prevention programs and the Emergency Action Program for preparation of the Risk Management Program and Plan.\nThese"
