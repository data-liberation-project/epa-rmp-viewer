If an emergency were to occur, we would notify the Davis County LEPC and the Bloomfield Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. As such, we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers, including Anhydrous Ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on site and is a regulated substance by EPA, requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell Anhydrous to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks. The cusomer applies the ammonia into the soil as a souirce of nitrogen fertilizer for growing Agricultural crops. This facility maintains approx. 44 - 1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 193,000 pounds. AnhydrousAmmonia is stored in one stationary storage tank @ 18,000 gallon on site. 79,000 pounds of Anhydrous is the maximum storage capacity of our Stationary tanks. The total Anhydrous Ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 272,000 pounds. The largest storage tank at our facility contains 79,000 pounds. It should be noted that Troy Elevator has never had a release  of the entire Stationary storage tank. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO -  The most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site, the alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2 minute release from stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down. The total amount of Anhydrous Ammonia released in this senario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario ( distance to point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Troy Elevator has not had a release of this type from it's facility. THE GENERAL ACC"

      "SummaryText": "IDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS. The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies woth the ANSI K61.1 Standards (1989), OSHA (29CFR1910.11) EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. Our ammonia sysytem is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-offs and emergency shut-off valves. The load out risers ussed for the purpiose of filling the nurse tanks by excess flow valves and full line breakaways to immediately stop flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails. All main storage tank valves and the riser load out valves are locked when not in rise. Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, guages and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to guidelines in the ANSI standards. Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and also on the job training. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY -  There has been no accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused deaths, injuries - property or environmental damage including evacuation on or off site. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM -  In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information to ensure that they are familiar with and are properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for res"

This complies with the requirements for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPC RA and coordinated with the LEPC. In addition, Troy Elevator has as Emergency Action Plan for its facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA(29CFR1910.38). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY -  We do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfers and handling procedures,  and provide regular inspections and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment. We have installed 8 inch pipe filled with cement for barracades around main storage tank and have locks for liquid valves on all nurse tanks to prevent theft and/or tampering."
