We work with the KDPS (fire department) to ensure pre-emergency planning and response procedures are coordinated and to provide facility tours to any KDPS personnel that may someday be required to respond to an emergency.\n\n\n\nOur fire protection systems, which include signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of all processing areas, are tested regularly.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel who may participate in emergency response are provided training, and participate in training exercises at least annually.  \n\n\n\n\n\n(f.) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAllnex is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology and employee training, as well as our inspection, repair and maintenance program for process equipment, in order to improve safety and process safety performance."
