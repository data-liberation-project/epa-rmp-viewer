Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\nThe Allnex USA Inc., facility in Langley, South Carolina contains a RMP covered process, which is an acrylic polymer and waterborne epoxy coating manufacturing process.  \r\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations as well as our own environmental, health, and safety standards.  The Langley Plant manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation, operating and maintaining the plant safely and by auditing our operations. Our accident prevention program is based on OSHA Process Safety Management regulations and our emergency response program is based on OSHA HAZWOPER regulations.\r\nThe Langley Plant  is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  The Langley facility is actively involved with local organizations concerned with the safety of our community and the environment such as the Aiken County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Aiken County HAZMAT and a Community Advisory Panel.\r\n\r\n2.  The facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\nThe Langley manufacturing facility is located at 403 Carline Road, Langley, South Carolina.  To produce acrylic polymers, acrylic monomers are copolymerized with acrylonitrile in either solvent or emulsion medium.  To produce epoxy coatings, acrylonitrile is reacted with amine and epoxy functional materials.  The final products are either non-hazardous acrylic emulsions or acrylic solutions with flammability hazard.  The products are then shipped to industrial customers in bulk trucks, totes and drums for the production of adhesives and protective coatings for various substrates.\r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps are:\r\nOur accident prevention program is based on OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  The Langley Plant manages the safety of our facility by designing for safe operation,"

Systems and equipment are designed  to engineering standards and codes. Safety reviews are conducted prior to all projects and changes.  \r\nOperations are conducted safely by trained and certified operators who follow well maintained standard operating procedures with defined safe operating limits.  Routine process safety meetings are held for all personnel. Investigations are conducted for all incidents.\r\nWe maintain operational safety through preventative maintenance and equipment inspection programs.  We hold contractors to the same high safety training standards as our employees.  We utilize task observations and accident prevention techniques on jobs. We routinely audit our operations for compliance with federal, state, and local regulation.  We also have a comprehensive program to audit the plant's performance against corporate environmental and safety standards.\r\n\r\n4.  Five year accident history:\r\nThere have been no incidents at the facility that meet the EPA Risk Management Program reporting requirements.\r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  Employees are  trained to the 24-hour HAZWOPER level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Aiken County LEPC and Langley Volunteer Fire Departments for awareness on potential hazards and locations of materials at the site.   \r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\nAlthough we have no current plans to install new mitigation, control equipment nor to change technology, we are constantly striving for continued improvement in all aspects of environ"
