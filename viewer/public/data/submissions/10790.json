This document provides an overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the Neal Plant has implemented.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n \nThe Neal Plant of Aristech Chemical Corporation was one of the first sites to produce polypropylene in the United States.  The original facilities were brought on line in 1961.  Since then, the uses and demand for polypropylene have grown steadily.  In response, the facilities have been expanded and updated several times, most recently in 1988 with the installation of state-of-the-art Spheripol loop reactors and in 1989 and 1995 with the addition of the latest extrusion technology.  This new technology not only assures customers of a long-term, high quality and consistent source, but it has also made the plant more energy efficient and environmentally advanced.\n\nThe Neal Plant's polypropylene production process utilizes the regulated flammable substances, propylene and propane, along with catalysts and hydrogen as feedstocks.\n\nThe areas of the plant that are covered by the Risk Management Plan are:\n\nPropylene and Propane Storage (Area 10)\nPropylene Distillation (Area 11)\nPolymerization Unit  (Area 91)\nPropylene RR Tank Car Unloading\n\nThe worst-case scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - The failure of the largest propylene storage tank  when filled to the greatest amount allowed is considered the worst case scenario at the facility.  The Operations Department limits the maximum filling of this tank to a level of 80% (88% of the maximum volume).  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent"

This scenario would reach nearby offsite public receptors. \n\nThe storage tanks are equipped with a water curtain system to cover the tanks with a large volume of water in order to cool the tanks in case of fire and to disperse vapors.  The use of the water curtain system to disperse the vapor cloud was not considered in the calculation of the release rate, in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario -The Alternative-Case Scenario is defined as a release with off site consequences that is more probable than the Worst-Case Scenario.  At the Neal Plant this scenario is a \"pull-away\" at one of the Rail Road Unloading Stations and the subsequent release of the contents of a propylene tank car.   It is assumed the released propylene vapor finds an ignition source, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. This scenario would reach nearby offsite public receptors. \n\nThe Alternative-Case Scenario does not consider the use of any of the following protection and mitigation systems that are in place at this facility:\n- The railcars that are being unloaded are \"chocked\" to prevent movement.  Also, derailers are used to protect the unloading stations from cars on the other tracks.\n- The railcars are equipped with excess flow valves that would shut upon separation of the unloading hose.\n- The Rail Road Unloading Stations are equipped with a water curtain system to cover the tank cars with a large volume of water in order to cool the tank cars in case of fire and to disperse the vapor cloud.  \n- The Rail Road Unloading Stations are equipped with hydrocarbon detectors that will alarm in the control room if there is a release.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Neal Plant is in full compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which includes the following elements:\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION"

It is essential that employees are trained properly to perform their jobs safely and that the experience and knowledge of employees is used to maintain and improve the safety of the plant.  In order to fulfill this policy the following elements of employee participation in the Neal Process Safety Management System are detailed below:\n\nThe primary method for Process Hazard Analysis  (PHA) used at the Neal Plant is the Hazard and Operability Study  (HAZOP) technique.  HAZOP meetings are conducted routinely to analyze the safety of selected areas of the plant and to analyze changes that are initiated by the FOC (Facility or Operational Change) procedure. The HAZOP is conducted by a team that is composed of employees who have experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated and at least one member who is knowledgeable of the HAZOP methodology.   The membership of the HAZOP committee includes at least one member of the PACE (Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union) Union in the affected area of the study.

The Process Safety Coordinator will determine which technique is appropriate.  A PHA Team meets routinely to evaluate the hazards of existing processes or may evaluate potential hazards identified by the FOC procedure.  The Process Safety Coordinator will assign an identifier to each PHA and track generated action items to their resolution in a Plant Level Action Item File (PLAIT) database.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nSafe Job Procedures (SJP's) and Operating Procedures are required and include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures that pertain to the ISO 9002 quality system are identified as Work Instructions or WIN.  The Neal Plant's SJP's and Operating Procedures are reviewed annually to keep them current and to certify that practices match procedures.   Monthly training with process safety critical SJP's is a part of the Continuous Training program.\n\nStandard work practices are required for lockout/tagout, confined space entry, gas testing, vehicle entry and hot work. These Standard Procedures are maintained in the Policy and Procedures Manual.\n\nTRAINING"
