This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility owned by DAS has 2 RMP regulated substances present above the threshold quantity. These substances include: Ammonia (anhydrous) and Sulfur dioxide.  \r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\r\nWe have included administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario where permitted and applicable.  To evaluate the worst case and alternate case scenarios, we have used EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific\r\nPrevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nWe maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our proce"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at pre-established intervals and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nWe conduct maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes but is not limited to: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modifications.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Brazoria County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\nAs the operator of the plant, The Dow Chemical Company manages and leads the immediate response for any events in the facility.  They also communicate with the community and any outside services in order to coordinate response.   DAS partners with Dow to inform them of changes to the facility that may impact emergency planning and response activities.\r\nIn summary, Dow Emergency Services and Security (ES&S) provides integrated Site Services for the protection of people and assets, including equipment and other fixed assets. These services include the following: Emergency Response Planning and Preparedness; Emergency Response; Site Security Planning and Preparedness; Site Asset Security; and maintenance & operation of emergency response equipment.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. We continuously install equipment, controls, and administrative programs to reduce risk to our employees, the community and environment.  Recent efforts include installation of a scrubber to reduce air emissions, elimination of a flare, process changes to reduce the concentration of ammonia in our waste water discharge, to name a few."

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nWe believe that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
