Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n    At the Air Products Escambia Plant, ammonia, liquid hydrogen, methanol, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, methylamines, dimethyl urea and various amines derived from higher alcohols are produced. Some of the compounds handled are considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. We insist on strict adherence to safety precautions developed to prevent human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal safety and health, as well as the safety and health of our coworkers and minimize the threat to our community. Our safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the proper maintenance of the safety systems designed into these facilities, the procedures used by our personnel and the training of these personnel.\n\n    The Escambia Plant is an OSHA STAR site. Our safety programs are modeled after the CMA's Codes of Repsonsible Care. Our emergency response plan, which is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation, contains procedures for notification of the local Emergency Management Authority, local fire department and potentially affected neighbors. Neighbor notification can take the form of an automated telephone ring down system, sponsored by local industry. The telephone system is augmented by a network of sirens surrounding the plant site, which can be activated by either Emergency Management or Plant personnel.\n\n    This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n    The primary purpose of this facility is to convert natural gas and alcohols into a variety of chemical intermediates.

The worst-case scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\n    The \"worst-case scenario\" involving a toxic compound, as defined by the EPA, is the release of 2,000,000 pounds of ammonia from a storage sphere over a period of 10 minutes. The released ammonia is assumed to all vaporize within the same 10 minute period and form a toxic vapor cloud. Although we have active controls, including redundant overpressure protection and manual and automatic isolation systems designed to prevent such a release, no credit for active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this \"worst-case\" scenario.\n\n    The \"alternative case scenario\" for a toxic substance at this facility is a demand on the pressure relief valve protecting the #1 Amines Ammonia Column in ammonia service. This relief valve demand would release 28,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period. We"

The released is assumed to form a vapor cloud and explode. Although we have active controls, including redundant overpressure protection and manual and automatic isolation systems designed to prevent such a release, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this \"worst-case scenario\".\n\n    The \"alternative case scenario\" for a flammable substance at this facility is a \"pull away\" of a fully loaded liquid hydrogen trailer releasing 7500 pounds. The released material forms a vapor cloud and explodes. We have active controls directed at preventing such a release. The trailer is disconnected from the tractor prior to loading and the trailer loading area is equipped with pullaway protection.\n\n4. The general accident prevention program and specific program steps:\n\n    The facility developed prevention program elements based on the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes. \n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\n    Within the past five years there have been two incidents that would be reported under RMP.\n\n    The first occurred on 5/3/1997 and involved the release of approximately 22,000 pounds of mixture containing 81% ammonia from a relief valve in the Methylamines Plant. The relief valve demand occurred as a result of high pressure due to the loss of cooling water flow. 43 people sought follow-up medical attention. The changes made after the incident included equipment upgrades, revised training, revised operating procedures, changes to the trip and interlock systems and revisions to the emer"

Approximately 31,000 pounds of a mixture containing 52% ammonia were released. The line ruptured as a result of corrosion/errosion. Approximately 1000 people sheltered in place. Approximately 50 people sought follow-up medical attention. Property damage was estimated at $4000 and was primarily deodorizing households and automobiles. As a result the piping design was modified, preventative maintenance procedures were revised and emergency response plans were revised.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\n     The facility's emergency response program is based on OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. All employees have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The plant also has a fire and emergency services crew, who are trained to the HAZMAT Technician or HAZMAT Specialist levels of the OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. All employees receive annual refresher training in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Agency and the Pace Volunteer Fire Department. Periodic drills are conducted with these agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency plans. The last drill was held with the Santa Rosa County Emergency Management Agency on 10/26/2000. Monthly planning and communications meetings are held with the Santa Rosa County EMA.\n\n7.   Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n     Plant hazards reviews, risk analyses or incident reviews are among the systems we rely on to drive safety improvements. At this time there are no major administrative, operational, process of equipment changes planned for the facility."
