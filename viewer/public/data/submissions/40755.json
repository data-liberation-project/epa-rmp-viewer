Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Great Lakes Chemical, Central Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also completely coordinated with Union County Sheriff which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic and inorganic chemical synthesis.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include ammonia, bromine, chlorine, ethyl chloride, phosgene [carbonic dichloride], and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.   Ammonia is used for acid adjustment and neutralization.  Bromine is used for chemical synthesis.  Chlorine is used for bromine replacement.  Phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is used for chemical synthesis.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used for  bromine recovery and scavenging.  \n\nThe maximum inventory of bromine at our facility is 3,488,993 lb. while chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] are present at our facility in quantities of 1,800,000 lb., 158,000 lb., 114,000 lb., and 72,000 lb. respectively.\n\n3.

For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of two railroad tank cars of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a distance of some miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a pipe leak on the ammonia storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 500 lbs. of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.2 mile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for bromine involves a release from a pipe leak on the bromine storage tanks in the Bromine Refining process.  The scenario involves the release of 750 lbs. of bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 35.7 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of bromine is 0.7 "

The scenario involves the release of 1200 lbs. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 20 minutes.

The scenario involves the release of 20 lbs. of sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum disatance to the toxic endpoint of .0078 mg/L of sulfur dioxide is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for phosgene [carbonic dichloride] involves a release from a pipe leak on the phosgene cylinders in the TCO Unit process.  The scenario involves the release of 600 lb. of phosgene [carbonic dichloride] in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.00081 mg/L of phosgene [Carbonic dichloride] is 3.7 miles.\n\n4.
