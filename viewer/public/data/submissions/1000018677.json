Emergencies are classified through a site-wide standardized system that uses Emergency Action Levels (EALs) as criteria for equating an incident to a specific emergency classification level.  Using the specific criteria outlined in the EALs, the Plant Shift Superintendent (PSS) determines the level of response required and determines if the event meets the proper criteria to classify the event as an Alert or a Site Area Emergency (SAE). Upon determination of event classification, the Incident Commander (IC) makes notifications to off-site agencies and activates the EOC Cadre.  \r\n\r\nEmergency response facilities have been pre-designated and equipped for use in an emergency. In some instances, emergency response facilities are continuously staffed, performing routine response-related activities, such as handling requests for ambulances or dispatching protective force personnel. Dedicated facilities are immediately available to support emergency operations upon arrival of staff.  A non-dedicated facility has procedures in place to convert it into the appropriate configuration to support emergency response activities in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nPrompt notification of on-site personnel, emergency responders, and off-site organizations and agencies is critical during an emergency event. The USEC PSS is responsible for notifying the ERO using the plant radio system, pagers, Public Address (PA) system and/or the plant telephone system.\r\n\r\nThe severity of some emergencies onsite may warrant the use of off-site individuals, organizations, and agencies. As a result, agreements with off-site support agencies have been developed and are maintained by USEC.  USEC Emergency Management is the primary interface with off-site Federal, State, and local emergency response agencies and organizations.  These support services include medical assistance, fire control, evacuation, law enforcement and ambulance services. \r\n\r\nDuring emergencies, the USEC PSS, (or designee), or Crisis Man"

Data is collected at the program and task levels.\r\n\r\nBWCS management systems for feedback and continuous improvement include; assessments, subcontract submittals, and reporting protocols. These management systems provide ongoing evaluation of both BWCS and subcontractor performance to assure conformance to specified requirements and effective implementation. Examples of these systems include self assessments and independent assessments to provide ongoing, formal feedback. Issues identified from assessments are documented, causal analyses are performed, and corrective actions developed and tracked to closure. Analyses are conducted on a regular basis to identify trends for management action. Data from these processes are evaluated by senior management to identify opportunities for improvement."

These programs and procedures also apply for the management of structures, systems, programs, and components that pertain to Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered process and related activities.\r\n\r\nAs part of the DSAs, process safety analyses have been conducted to identify potential hazards in the process and associated controls to prevent and mitigate releases.  These controls include passive barriers, active features, and operator actions.\r\n\r\nThe primary controls associated with the storage of HF acid (55 wt%) are the HF storage tanks.  These tanks are designed to contain the HF acid under all conditions including credible natural phenomena events.  A dike around each tank provides secondary containment for any leak.  HF vapor detectors and tank level sensors provide indication of a leak and should a leak occur, actuate valves to isolate the HF storage tanks.  Operators are required to monitor transfers from the HF storage tanks to the rail or truck tankers and stop the transfer should a leak occur during the transfer.  Installed pumps and piping can be used to immediately pump leaked material back to any of the HF storage tanks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the aforementioned controls, BWCS also has programs to ensure safe and effective operations.  These programs include but are not limited to the following: Radioactive and Hazardous Waste Management; Industrial Safety, Initial Testing, In-Service Surveillance, and Maintenance; Fire Protection; Procedures and Training; Emergency Management; Configuration Management; Conduct of Operations; Unreviewed Safety Question; and Quality Assurance.\r\n\r\nOperating and maintenance procedures have been established and operators have been trained on routine evolutions as well as process startup, shutdown, maintenance and emergency oper"

The plan flows down the applicable requirements of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) Paducah Emergency Plan and describes the DUF6 Paducah Project emergency management program.   USEC is the lead organization responsible for managing the overall direction and control of emergency responses at the Paducah site.  BWCS is responsible for overall compliance of the program with applicable regulations and implementation of the USEC plan, while ensuring DOE requirements are met. \r\n\r\nThis program has been established to manage and respond in a consistent and integrated way to accidents or other emergency situations that may occur at the site. The structure of this program is intended to ensure that the consequences of emergencies are promptly mitigated and that the health and safety of the public, personnel on the surrounding DOE reservation, plant personnel, and environment are protected, regardless of the cause or nature of the emergency.  The Emergency Management organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the Emergency Plan as appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe emergency plan describes the emergency response structure and roles and responsibilities prior to, during, and after an emergency.  The plan describes the actions during an emergency which include the following: Declaration of an emergency, Activation of the Emergency Operation Center (EOC), emergency response, reentry, and event termination.

This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in safety throughout facility design, construction, operation and maintenance.  BWCS has developed detailed programs and procedures to effectively implement this commitment.  The programs and procedures systematically integrate safety, health, environmental protection and quality assurance into all levels of management and work practices.  \r\n\r\n2.0\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBWCS operates a Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (DUF6) conversion facility for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at the DOE Paducah site in Kevil Kentucky, to disposition DUF6 stored at the DOE site.  The facility employs a dry conversion process that utilizes a one-step fluidized bed unit to convert DUF6 to uranium oxide powder that is collected and packaged for reuse or disposal. This is accomplished by reacting DUF6 gas with steam and hydrogen that produces hydrofluoric acid as a saleable end product.   \r\n\r\nA byproduct of the DUF6 conversion process is the production of 55 wt% HF acid. A total maximum quantity of 660,000 pounds of HF acid (55 wt%) is temporarily staged on site in several tanks before transfer to tankers for offsite shipment.  This amount exceeds the threshold quantity specified in 40CFR68.   Further evaluation indicated that the Conversion Facility is subject to Program 1 requirements of 40CFR68.
