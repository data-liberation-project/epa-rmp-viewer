Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nCharles B. Garnsey Water Treatment Plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nEast Central Florida Regional Planning Council, 1011 Wymore Road, suite 105, Winter Park, Florida 32789, Phone: (407) 623-1075, Fax: (407) 623-1084 is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. The inclusion of a fully enclosed and release secure Chlorine containment building with automatic gas detection equipment and alarm system, and a scrubber release mitigation system are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be included in our plant expansion, that will tentatively begin in the fall of 1999, and should be completed an implemented near the end of the year 2000.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge"

Garnsey Water Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas of design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Port Orange, Fla. Fire and Rescue, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the treatment of raw well water, through a lime softening treatment process, for the use of the community of Port Orange, Fla. The water is disinfected using a combined chlorine (chlorine and anhydrous ammonia) residual. The water is then filtered, and either pumped to storage, or directly into the water distribution system to meet the consumer's demand. We have 2 regulated substances at our facility. These substances include Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in one predominate use. Both Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia together are used for the disinfection of the potable water supply.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 18000 lbs., while Anhydrous Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 4300 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls And Mitigation Measures To Limit The Distance For Each Reported Scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp software provided by the EPA.
