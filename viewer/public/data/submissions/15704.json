      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nWe at Charles B. Garnsey Water Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas of design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Port Orange, Fla. Fire and Rescue, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the treatment of raw well water, through a lime softening treatment process, for the use of the community of Port Orange, Fla. The water is disinfected using a combined chlorine (chlorine and anhydrous ammonia) residual. The water is then filtered, and either pumped to storage, or directly into the water distribution system to meet the consumer's demand. We have 2 regulated substances at our facility. These substances include Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in one predominate use. Both Chlorine and Anhydrous Ammonia together are used for the disinfection of the potable water supply.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 18000 lbs., while Anhydrous Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 4300 lbs.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls And Mitigation Measures To Limit The Distance For Each Reported Scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp software provided by the EPA. The following paragraphs provide "

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance at or above the threshold quantity in Program 2 and 3 processes cumulatively.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Tank #1 in the Chlorine process.The scenario involves the release of 2000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is .8 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Chemical Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
