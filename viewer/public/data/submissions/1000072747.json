The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Crystal Valley Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 415,000 pounds in our 18,000 and 15,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3.  \"Worst-Case Scenario/ Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security sensitive information as requested by EPA.\"\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\n\"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"  In addition, Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules are also implemented.\n\n\n\n5.
