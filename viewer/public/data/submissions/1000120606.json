Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Energy Transfer mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Energy Transfer emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\t\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MCCLURE NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\t\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant, located at 9210 N. 2080 Road, Butler, Oklahoma 73625 in Custer County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration compression to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected  to represent all regulated flammable substances at the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\t\n\u00bf\tDemethanizer Surge Tank V-422 comprised, primarily, of ethane-plus (NGL) mixture\n\t\nThis process vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory a"

It is noteworthy that the McClure Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\t\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\t\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this Program Level 3 Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the ethane-plus NGL mixture.  For Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory capacity (100% maximum tank capacity of 116,746 gallons) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.60 miles.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant.  \n\t\n   \n\t\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\t\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant.  Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Operations personnel also participate in the development and review of operating procedures, process safety information (PSI), and training and mentoring of other personnel.\n\t\nProcess Safety Information\n\t\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant develops and maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\t \nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks-as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios, especially those assigned to the highest hazard risk, receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until assigned action items/tasks are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, dated and retained.\n\t\nPeriodically, the McClure plant updates and revalidates the initial process hazard analysis (PHA) to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features.  These periodic revalidation/reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will continue to be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\t\n\t\nTraining\n\t\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.
