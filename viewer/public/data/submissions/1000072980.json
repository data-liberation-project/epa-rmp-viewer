      "SummaryText": "Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Inkster Terminal, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum products terminal collocated in the cities of Taylor and Romulus, Michigan. The Facility receives, stores, and transfers liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline. The LPGs, primarily n-butane, isobutane, and butene and hereafter referred to as the Flammable Mixture, stored consist of butane and mixed butanes (n-butane, isobutane, and butene). LPG enters and leaves the facility through Department of Transportation (DOT) Part 195 Regulated underground pipelines and through truck loading and unloading stations.\n\n\n\nThe Facility has fixed inventories of the Flammable Mixture and operates one Flammable Mixture transfer and storage process. The Flammable Mixture is received by pipeline or truck (two [2] offload stations) and stored in seven (7) underground salt caverns ranging in capacity from 66,000 to 159,000 bbls each and two (2) horizontal storage vessels (approximately 60,000 gallons water capacity per vessel). The product received by pipeline is transferred directly into the salt caverns. The product received by truck is initially transferred to the horizontal storage vessels then typically transferred to one of the salt caverns. Brine water that is displaced by product receipt is transferred to Tank 4 (12,000 bbls) and then to the Brine ponds. Controls are in place to maintain integrity of the salt caverns and wellhead piping. Product is withdrawn by pushing Brine water back down the cavern and displacing the product. Product is distributed from the Facility either through pipeline or truck (two [2] loading stations).\n\n\n\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\n\n\n\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place "

Sunoco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Sunoco, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Wayne County Office of Emergency Management, the City of Taylor Fire Department, and Romulus Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a liquefied petroleum gas and flammable liquid storage and distribution facility.  Due to the flammable effects associated with the regulated substance, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  The Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which flammable substances are handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the processes.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nFor planning purposes, Sunoco has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. Sunoco also considered the impact of a more likely loss of conta"

Above all, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for our employees, our visitors and our community."
