The on-site leak scrubber control is manually, as opposed to automatically, in which it would be turned on by the leak detectors.  It was discovered that when the scrubber runs, chemical sprays out of the top of the unit.  The potential for creating a hazard for workers at the WWTP would then exist, since they could be close to the unit when it would come on automatically.  Our Maintenance Section staff  tried to solve the chemical spraying problem, but could not.  The manufacturer of the scrubber has gone out of buisness.  The unit can still be run on hand, when a leak is detected.  Potassium Hydroxide will be researched as an alternative chemical for use in the scrubber, to possibly reduce the risk of pesonnel hazard exposure during operation of the unit.",

The City of Salisbury Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has developed an Emergency Response Plan which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management standard and the US EPA's Emergency Response Plan.  The plan provides employees guidance on what to do in case of a chemical discharge emergency.  \n\n\n\n    WWTP Leadership plans to fully update and implement all portions of the     Plan as soon as possible.  Our near term goals include:\n\n\"    Continue training our personnel for a chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide leak/chemical emergency\n\n\"    Continue Plan coordination efforts with the Wicomico County Emergency Services (LEPC).  A table top Haz-Mat Team drill is projected for April 2005.  A field Haz-Mat Team drill is projected for May 2005.  Representatives of the LEPC, City Fire Department, and City Water Division leadership met, with the above dates for drills being projected.  \n\n\n\nThe original in - house Haz - Mat Team proved to be impractical, due to     the followed issues:  \n\n\n\n\"    Haz - Mat Team staffing requirements exceeded available WWTP personnel.  \n\n\"    Guaranteed Workmen's Compensation injury coverage, through the Heart and Lung Law was not available for our personnel. \n\n\n\n    Now that the City Fire Department (FD) has formed a Haz - Mat Team, we     are revising the Plan to incorporate their assistance:\n\n\n\n\"    In the event of a leak, the FD will be contacted to provide Haz - Mat Team response.  The LEPC will be contacted as well. \n\n\"    WWTP Leadership/personnel will act as liaison to the FD Command and Control.  \n\n\"    All other WWTP personnel will be evacuated.   \n\n\n\n2.    The City of Salisbury WWTP now treats approximately 5.5 million gallons per day of wastewater.  \n\n    \n\n3.  A rerun of the offsite consequence Worse Case Scenario analysis for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, utilizing RMP * Comp Ver. 1.07 resulted in the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nRMP*Comp Ver. 1.07\n\nResults of Conseq"
