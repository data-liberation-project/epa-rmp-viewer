THE HARVESTLAND POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS,MANAGMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF HARVESTLAND ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR,HARVESTLAND IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT,OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION  \n\n - THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT HARVESTLAND IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n - ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION TO AREA FIELD FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n - THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 227,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,OOO GALLON STORAGE TANK AND ALL ROLLING STOCK. \n\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO. \n\n   A. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A  STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 1O MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE  STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 1.12 MILES. \n\n  B. THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON A TWO MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A THREE INCH PIPE IS A DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF 0.78 MILES.\n\n4.
