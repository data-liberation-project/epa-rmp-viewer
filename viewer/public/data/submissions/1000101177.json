Each can may contain up to 60% by weight of a mixture of these flammable substances. \r\n\r\nThe Behr facility meets the Program Level 1 criterion as follows:\r\n1. The facility has not had a release from the aerosol can storage area in the last five (5) years that\r\nreached an off-site receptor.\r\n2. The distance to the endpoint was calculated using inputs assuming the propellant is a maximum\r\nof 60% by weight of the contents of a 13-ounce can. Modeling runs were completed based on a\r\nsingle propellant and a mixture of the three propellants. The results were the same: 0.006 miles, or\r\napproximately 32 feet. The nearest public receptor is approximately 310 feet south of the aerosol\r\ncan storage area.\r\n3. A copy of the facility's Emergency Business Plan (EBP) has been submitted to the Algona Fire\r\nDepartment. The plan was last updated in August 2021. Any substantial changes to the plan will\r\nbe submitted to the Algona Fire Department."

      "SummaryText": "The Behr Process Corporation Distribution Center located at 840 Industry Drive N., #F, Algona, Washington (Algona DC or facility) is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provision (CAPP) regulations, also known as the Risk Management Plan, or RMP regulations, found at 40 CFR Part 68.  The CAPP rule requires covered facilities to complete and submit a risk management plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), and to develop and implement a prevention program that consists of an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release, summary of the five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \r\n\r\nThe Behr facility stores products in aerosol cans that contain flammable propellants listed as regulated substances in 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart F. Based on the maximum storage capacity of the aerosol storage cage at the distribution center, the Behr facility exceeds the applicable threshold of 10,000 pounds (lb.) of a flammable regulated substance. Therefore, the facility is subject to the RMP regulations. Based on the worst case scenario modeled using RMP*Comp, and the accident history of the facility related to the storage of aerosol can products, the facility is subject to the Program 1 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Algona DC is a warehouse operation where products in consumer packaging, including aerosol cans, are received, stored and ultimately shipped to various retail locations.  Aerosol cans are stored within a fully enclosed caged area within a room with self-closing doors.  The aerosol can storage area is equipped with racks and an in-rack sprinkler system that provides water at each level of the racks.  The storage area has a capacity of approximately 475,000 aerosol cans.  The aerosol cans are 13 ounces (oz.) by weight and are stored in boxes of either six, 12 or 24 cans per box.  \r\n\r\nThe aerosol cans contain various spray products.
