NGLs are sent to pipeline and the lighter components are sent back to the facility inlet.\r\nThe facility is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation. The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Lilli Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 1 facility, a prevention program is not required under RMP.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Lilli Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe Lilli Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance. Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nNoble Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Noble continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Noble also endeavor"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nNoble Midstream is committed to the safety and health of its employees, contractors and visitors. The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Lilli Gas Plant is located near New Raymer in Weld County, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). \r\n\r\nInlet gas (natural gas) is received from gathering facilities and passes through a separator to remove entrained liquids. Condensate is routed to pressurized condensate storage and then to a truck loadout. \r\nThe gas is then compressed and enters the amine contactor to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide (acid gas) from the gas. The amine solution is recycled through the amine flash tank. The amine flash tank liberates hydrocarbons which are routed back to the facility inlet and recovered. The amine solution cycles back to the amine regenerator to remove acid gas from the amine so it can be reused. The amine reboiler supplies the heat to the amine regenerator. Acid gas from the amine regenerator is routed to the process flare for control.\r\n\r\nAfter the amine contactor, the gas flows through a mole sieve to remove any excess water, then is cooled and directed to a cold separator to remove the natural gas liquids (NGL). The pipeline quality gas then travels through a final compression stage before a final filtration and into the gas sales pi"
