All hazardous materials are to be handled in compliance with the laws and general practices of handling the materials.  The facility complies with all federal and state requirements for emergency response.  All of the required plans are in place and comply with Federal and State law.\n\n\nFacility & regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Alturas Waste Water Treatment Plant is for the treatment of domestic waste water prior to its release into the Pit River.  As part of this treatment we treat the effluent with chlorine to kill the coliform present in the water after treatment and then treat the effluent with sulfur dioxide to neutralize the chlorine.  The amount of chlorine at the site averages 975 pounds per day and the maximum present at any time is 1950 pounds. The amount of sulfur dioxide at the site averages 975 pounds per day and the maximum present at any time is 1950 pounds.  There is also an average of 285 gallons, and 570 gallons maximum, of propane present for heating of the facilities.\n\n\nWorst case release scenarios:\n\nThe worst case release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the complete release of the contents of a 150 pound cylinder of gas in 10 minutes.  The facility is located outside of the city and in a terrain feature that blocks flow of gas to the surrounding higher areas.  The worst case analysis shows that it would not reach any populated areas.  The worst case release of propane would be the complete release of the contents of a 320 gallon propane tank. The worst case analysis shows that it would not reach any populated areas.\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with OSHA regulations at 29 CFR 1910.38 and the California emergency planning and community right to know laws (Health & S"

The Hazardous Material Coordinator , the Alturas Rural Fire Department, Alturas City Fire Department, the Alturas Police Department, the Modoc County Sheriff's Department, OES, and Modoc County Environemental Health would be notified.  The local responders would determine the need to notify residents in the potential affected area and implementation of the appropriate response.  The employees of the facility have annual drills and are trained in the appropriate measures to meet the emergency plan requirements.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThere are no plans to make any changes in the facility."
