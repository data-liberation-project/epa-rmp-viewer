ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Hill Brothers, Rowley recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Hill Brothers, Rowley PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implemting and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our aqua ammonia storage and use system,\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     Hill Brothers, Rowley believes that employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the aqua ammonia storage and use operators, have been deeply involved in implementing the PSM/RMP program and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Rowley, Utah facility safely.\n\n     The Hill Brothers, Rowley Emergency Response Program is being developed wither the cooperation and support with the Grantsville, Utah Fire Department.  All Hills Brothers, Rowley employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Hill Brothers, Rowley receives aqua ammonia by rail car, stores it in Rowley, Utah, then distributes the aqua ammonia to the Utah area markets.  The aqua ammonia storage system contains no more than 128,900 lbs of aqua ammonia.  Aqua ammonia is the only hazardous materia on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the aqua ammonia storage tanks.  A maximum of 128, 900 lbs of aqua ammonia, over a 10 minute period"

Under worst case weather conditions , aqua ammonia could travel up to 0.9 miles before dispersing.\n\n    A WORST CASE release if extremely unlikely to occur duting the life of the facility; this is release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the PSM/RMP program.\n\n     An alternative case release scenario that call WORST CASE CREDIBLE was slightly more likely.  A 2,080 lb liquid aqua ammonia loss from a failing ammonia transfer hose during the unloading operation.  Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to 0.1 mile before dispersing.  This release is very unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant.\n\nIV.  DESCRIPTION OF THE HILL BROTHERS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Hill Brothers, Rowley will conduct an annual training and response exercise with the Grantsville Fire Department to practice, train and update the Emergency Response Program.\n\nHill Brothers, Rowley will conduct an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Hill Brothers considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Hill Brothers emphasizes and insists on  \"employee participation\" from the ammonia storage and use system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Hill Brothers, Rowley provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Hill Brothers maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia at Hill Brothers, Rowley as it is a ne"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency response plan is being coordinated with a neighboring industrial corporation, MagCorp, as the first emergency responder.  MagCorp is located approximately 600 feet from the Hill Brothers, Rowley facility.  The nearest fire department, Grantsville Fire Department, is located approximately 60 miles away.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Hill Brothers recognizes that their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" becomes second nature.\n\n     Hill Brothers expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing  the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program\n\n          (1)   Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program.  The aqua ammonia system operators are deeply involved in verifying the P&ID's, developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n          (2)    The Hill Brothers, Rowley PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and   (e) written to be understood and used by the operating level employees.\n\n          (3)   All recommendations developed during the HAZOP were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia storage & use process.  Hill Brothers, Rowley expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the "
