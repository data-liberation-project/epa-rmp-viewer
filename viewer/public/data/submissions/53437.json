(?Kinder Morgan?) distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA. The same properties that make anhydrous ammonia valuable as a commodity also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the EPA, Coast Guard, DOT, OSHA and LEPC requirements. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled. \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to temporarily store, break bulk, and distribute anhydrous ammonia to both retail and wholesale customers. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a raw material for manufacturing fertilizer products. Anhydrous ammonia is received by barge and stored in a 50,000 ton  storage tank.  Anhydrous ammonia also is distributed to customers by pipeline. This facility has equipment for unloading ships, and loading rail cars and tank trucks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is anhydrous ammonia. \n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Relea"

All of our employees have been thoroughly trained in accordance with 40 CFR 68. \n \n\n4.Five-year accident history. \n\nThere have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have had an adverse impact on the community.  There has not been an incident (since Kinder Morgan has owned the facility) at the terminal that meets the EPA Risk Management  Program (RMP) reporting requirements with respect to injuries involving the release of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n5. The emergency response program. \n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency, United States Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Local Emergency Planning Commission. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire and police authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.   This plan has been submitted to and approved by the respective regulatory agencies and is reviewed on an annual basis.  The facility is subject to regular annual inspections by each of the aforementioned governmental agencies.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that employees are adequately trained and prepared to respond to emergencies, they receive training in Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER), Emergency Action and Fire Prevention, Accidental Release Prevention, Environmental Awareness, and Terminal Safety Systems.  Employees also attend HAZWOPER refresher training annually.  \n\nFinally, the facility prepares for emergencies by conducting quarterly notification drills, semi-annual equipment deployment drills, annual tabletop exercises, and participates in area-wide drills that are conducted by governmental agencies.   \n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety. \n\nKinder "
