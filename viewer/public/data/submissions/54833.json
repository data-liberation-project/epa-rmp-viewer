Application of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with Cal/OSHA CCR Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management (PSM) of Acutely Hazardous Materials and the emergency response element of the PSM. The basic concept of PXP's emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies. The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nThe Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is designed to be applicable to any type of emergency that may affect PXP and based on the concept that the elements of emergency response are similar, regardless of the hazard. It contains pages from the Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The ERAP contains the following sections:\n\n1. Facility Information;\n2. Notifications;\n3. Initial Response Actions;\n4. Evacuation Plans/Emergency Shutdown Procedures;\n5. Oil Pipeline Route; and\n6. Ballona Creek Boom and Staging Locations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPXP enforces continuous improvements to safety and health and tracks training to ensure commitment to safe working practices and the protection of the employees and the environment.\n\nFinally, because the PSM manual is maintained as a living document, its continuing updating provides a means of sustaining its original objective to improv"

As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation as faulty or potentially faulty, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of Change - Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes \nto operating procedures. The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for replacements in kind) to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the existing manufacturing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of CalARP/RMP, PXP is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. A PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes that require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold. For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than replacement in kind made to the process during shutdown go through the management of change process."

The objective of the regulation is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. To control these types of hazards, PXP has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within its workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective prevention program. Through compliance with the regulations and standards and with the guidance of the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the PXP Inglewood Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Prevention Program 3. \n\nAn effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire chemical process. Using this approach, the following components were considered in the evaluation in accordance with Title 19 CCR Section 2745.6 and 40 CFR part 68. \n\nThe twelve elements that make up the \nPrevention Program 3 are:\n\n1. Process Safety Information;\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA);\n3. Operating Procedures;\n4. Training;\n5. Mechanical Integrity;\n6. Management of Change;\n7. Pre-Startup Review;\n8.

An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the CalARP standards. The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the program elements are effectively implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation - A crucial part of PXP's program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented. Accordingly, PXP has an incident investigation program that requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\n\nEmployee Participation Plan - PXP has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation, and management of these program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices \n- PXP has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety. Details of both hot work and safe work practices are detailed in the PSM. \n\nContractor Safety - PXP, in following OSHA's PSM Guidelines, requires that a contractor's safety program be evaluated, that contractor employees be trained regarding potential process hazards and emergency procedures, and that appropriate records are maintained.

To achieve this end, PXP strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. \n\nPXP implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue, and medical activities). Protection of the environment is also a high priority. Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Inglewood Field is located at 5640 South Fairfax Ave in metropolitan Los Angeles, seven miles west-southwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level. PXP uses the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation for prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures, or equipment. The elements of the PXP's accidental release prevention program are summarized as follows:\n\nProcess Safety Information - This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company's PSM program and to a process hazard analysis. The process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of flammable compressed gases and the technology and equipment of the NGL system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) - Is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials. The PHA has been updated and can be found in Appendix J. \n\nOperating Procedures - As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the process equipment are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this equipment. As needed, changes or updates to the processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company's management of change program.\n\nEmployee Tra"
