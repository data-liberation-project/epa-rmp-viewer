These programs provide for the implementation of detailed prevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP programs. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired meat temperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing RMP*Comp, and the 2010 U.S. Census population data and offsite public and environmental receptors are based upon information pulled from Marplot on 9/8/2020. How to determine the worst-case scenario and alternative release scenario was derived from EPA's Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities (May 2004).\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents Associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.
