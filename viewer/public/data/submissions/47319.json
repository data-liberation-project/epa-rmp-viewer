Equipment inspection is conducted daily at the refinery and the frequency is based on engineering data.  The \"most recent\" inspection date changes each day.  The database is not designed to query for the most recent inspections at each unit.  Therefore the date provided in this report is for a specific unit at the time this report was completed.  For 7.9, date of PSSR is not required to be documented (not required by OSHA) but is performed in accordance with OSHA and BP standards.  For new or modified facilities, PSSRs are conducted as part of normal project work flow.",

Equipment inspection is conducted daily at the refinery and the frequency is based on engineering data.  The \"most recent\" inspection date changes each day.  The database is not designed to query the most recent inspections at each unit.  Therefore the date provided in this report is for a specific unit at the time this report was completed.  For 7.9, date of PSSR is not required to be documented (not required by OSHA) but is performed in accordance with OSHA and BP standards.  For new or modified facilities, PSSRs are conducted as part of normal project work flow.",

Equipment inspection is conducted daily at the refinery and the frequency is based on engineering data.  The \"most recent\" inspection date changes each day.  The database is not designed to query the most recent inspections at each unit.  Therefore the date provided in this report is for a specific unit at the time this report was completed.  For 7.9, date of PSSR is not required to be documented (not required by OSHA) but is performed in accordance with OSHA and BP standards.  For new or modified facilities, PSSRs are conducted as part of normal project work flow.",

Conducting business in a manner that wins public confidence and meets the environmental and economic needs of the communities we serve is critical to our long-term success.  \n\nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities, as well as in the training or our employees.  Our policy is to implement the necessary controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have trained personnel who will respond to control and contain the release, thereby reducing potential impact on our surrounding community.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery is located in the city of Carson, California.  The site occupies 630 acres and employs more than 1000 people.  The refinery has to capacity to process approximately 265,000 barrels of crude oil per day to produce a variety of petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, and petroleum coke, as well as products such as propylene, natural gas liquids and other petrochemicals.  The facility also includes the Watson Cogeneration Unit.  The Watson Cogeneration Unit is a joint venture between BP West Coast Products LLC and Southern California Edison.  The Cogeneration Unit burns natural gas to produce electricity, which is sold to the Edison grid.  Waste heat from the process is then used to supply steam to the refinery for process use.\n\nThe refinery has several regulated fl"

The primary use of ammonia is in the air pollution control system for the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.  It is also used for process corrosion control. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the BP Carson Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and operating procedures to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  In addition, the refinery has a number of programs underway that address employee safety issues, including a comprehensive program for behavioral safety.  This program provides training for each employee to enable them to observe fellow employees in order to identify and correct behaviors that may lead to accident or injury.  Developed and managed by our employees, this peer review program is a well supported by our employees and is a fundamental part of our safety program.  Other ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in written programs maintained at the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery maintains extensive documentation that is used to help maintain safe"

This documentation addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) contained in Operating Manuals and Design Process Books.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe refinery uses the HAZOP (haz"

The hazards of the process, identification of previous incidents involving accidental release or potential for such, engineering and administrative controls and failure of such, and human factors will be addressed by the team performing the hazard analysis.  The findings and recommendations of the team are submitted to area management to assess the likelihood of the potential hazards, assess the severity of the consequences from potential releases, and assign priority for implementation of recommendations.  The recommendations and progress towards implementation is followed using a computerized tracking system.  The final resolution of findings are documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Carson Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) unit emergencies and emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, and 6) initial startup of a new process.  \n\nThe operating procedures are currently available to anyone working in or near a process area at the appropriate process unit control rooms or through area supervisors.

Critical procedures such as unit emergency procedures are reviewed annually during annual training sessions.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Carson Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating or maintaining a process.  Initial training for operating and maintenance personnel who are new to a process includes health and safety training, fundamentals of refining, process overview and process fundamentals.  Job specific training is given to operators assigned to an operating unit.  This training includes specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the operator?s job tasks.  Job specific training includes on-the-job training, a written manual, written tests, observations, and written sign-off.  The Carson Refinery also has ongoing refresher and supplemental training for all personnel.  Testing is conducted for all job specific training and craft qualification for each level of progression.  Once an operator is qualified in a position, they are required to recertify for the job every three years by comprehensive testing.  Testing is also conducted on all OSHA-required safety and health training.  Employee training and certification records are documented, both in hard copy and computerized training records.\n\nContractors\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities, or to perform tasks requiring skills that are needed on a non-routine basis.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about refinery safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  Additionally, all contractors that work at the Carson Refinery must have completed an 8-hour training program (Refinery Safety Orders) that provides a standardized baseline of safety and health training for all contractors that perform work at local area refineries.  Recertification to demonstrate knowledge of the required subject areas is required every two years.  In addition, the BP Carson Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance as one of the key criteria for selection of a contractor to perform work in the refinery.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nA pre-startup safety review is conducted at the Carson Refinery for any new/modified facilities where modification necessitates a change in the process safety information.  The pre-startup review is used to confirm that prior to the introduction of hazardous materials to a process, that the following takes place: 1) construction and modification are in accordance with design specifications and applicable codes; 2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; 3) training of each operating employee and maintenance worker has been completed; and 4) process hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved or actions necessary for startup have been completed.

The basic aspects of this program include: 1) written procedures to maintain ongoing integrity of process equipment, including methods to allow employee identification and reporting of mechanical integrity problems; 2) inspection and testing, including correction of deficiencies; 3) employee training; and 4) quality assurance.  \n\nCarson Refinery employees report potentially faulty or unsafe equipment via one or more of the following: Operator Daily Logs, a Maintenance Job Order System, direct notification of supervision, EH&S audit programs, or focused audits (platforms, electrical, etc.).  \n\nThe Carson Refinery has an extensive inspection and testing program.  The frequency of inspections is based on historical corrosion rate.  The Carson Refinery has a comprehensive database program, which assimilates and analyzes corrosion data from equipment at the refinery and determines their corrosion rates.  These rates, together with industry standards or codes are used to determine frequency of inspections.  All inspectors at the Carson Refinery have certification in the appropriate performance area.  Written documentation is maintained for both the administrative and technical procedures.  Inspection deficiencies are documented.  The status of each inspection and repair completion is tracked until the issue is resolved, implemented, and closed.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team?s findings and recommendations are documented and tracked to completion.  The investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA?s and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, BP West Coast Products LLC periodically conducts audits of its operating facilities, including the Carson Refinery, to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and audit reports are maintained for review in subsequent audits.\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP and \nCal-ARP covered processes at the BP Carson Refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that co"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n?    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n?    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automatic)\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature\n?    Diking to contain liquid releases\n?    Redundant equipment and instrumentation \n?    Atmospheric pressure relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n?    Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n?    Trained emergency response personnel\n?    Personal protective equipment (protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  Due to proactive efforts to prevent accidents and a strong safety program, there have been no incidents in the past 5 years with onsite or offsite effects involving a release of ammonia or flammables that meet the reporting criteria of the EPA RMP or Cal-ARP Rules.  \n\nThere is one recorded accidental release which resulted in exposing one contract employee to Hydrogen Sulfide in sufficient quantity to require medical attention.  The accident was the result of equipment failure.  We conducted an investigation and developed corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe BP Carson Refinery has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including notification of emergency response agencies if a release occurs that could endanger the public or the environment and post-incident clean-up and decontamination procedures.  The plan includes or utilizes the following: 1) pre-emergency planning, including training, drills and reviews; 2) responsibilities for all employees involved in response, control, containment, notification, evacuation, etc.; 3) plans for evacuation to safe areas; 4) emergency traffic control and security; 5) weather monitoring through an on-site weather station (wind direction, wind speed) and visible wind socks; 6) emergency first aid and treatment.  In addition, the refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response plan is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the BP Carson Refinery is coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  This coordination includes periodic meeting and program review as well as joint training opportunities during on-site training exercises and off-site fire and hazardous materials training schools.  The Carson Refinery has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations, which provides a quick means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.  Periodic emergency drills are conducted that involve the local emergency response organizations, and training is provided to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances and other hazardous substances at the refinery.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROV"
