Our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local regulations is demonstrated through SPEG?s comprehensive accidental release prevention program for all critical process systems addressing design, installation, operating and maintenance procedures and schedules, and employee and contractor training and certification.  \n\nIn the event that an emergency event were to occur at the Elk Grove Terminal, response protocols have been developed and coordinated with offsite responders, including the Elk Grove Fire Department, the Elk Grove Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff?s Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District.  Moreover, the Elk Grove Terminal maintains onsite fire-fighting and emergency response systems and equipment to support and augment offsite emergency response resources.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Suburban Propane Elk Grove Terminal is a bulk storage and transfer facility for liquid propane, SIC Code 5171/NAICS Code 42471: LPG Bulk Stations and Terminals. Propane is the only regulated substance handled at the facility.  The SPEG terminal is designed to receive and ship liquified propane gas by either rail or tanker. The terminal?s storage capacity exceeds the federal threefold for this regulated substance.\n\nIn 2008 the Terminal?s mailing address and site access changed from the south side of the facility to west side at 10455 East Stockton Blvd,  Elk Grove, Ca.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Suburban Propane Elk Grove Terminal complies with all applicable federal, stat"

Process and equipment shut down procedures;\n?    Fire protection procedures;\n?    Evacuation procedures;\n?    Emergency Responder notification procedures;\n?    Public notification procedures;\n?    Post-emergency investigation and reporting requirements; and\n?    Post-emergency process systems inspection and startup procedures\n\nThe Terminal?s EAP has been coordinated with, and is regularly inspected by, local offsite responders, including the Elk Grove Fire Department, the Elk Grove Police Department, the Sacramento County Sheriff?s Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District.   The Elk Grove Terminal maintains onsite fire-fighting and emergency response systems and equipment to support and augment offsite emergency response resources as well.  The site?s emergency response systems and equipment are maintained in accordance with the site?s accidental release prevention program requirements.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of the latest process hazard assessment and compliance audit conducted in 2003, the Suburban Propane Elk Grove Terminal will to the following no later than January 2006:\n\n?
