We have demonstrated our commitment the safety and the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia by excellont safety record and the traning we have done internally and externally. The primary activity we are involved in with anhydrous ammonia is the recieving from trucks to the storage tanks and transfering from the storage tanks to the nurse trailers for our farmer owners. this activity is heaviy regulated by OSHA, EPA, DOT, and the Kansas Department of Agriculture. Our storage plant is a 12,000 gallon tank that holds 52,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, limited by design standards. The worst case release scenario wold be the release of the total contents of the tank as a gas in 10 minutes. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion t0 200 ppm)  is 1.5 miles. The alternative release scenario based on a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case(point of dispersion to200 ppm) is .83 miles.Our firm has an emergency response plan and over the years we have shared this with our local emergency personnel. We also are inspected by the Kansas State Department of Agriculture (who follows the ANSI K-61 standards) and have participated in the Kansas Right-To-Know program in which we report quantites of hazardous materials to the State of Kansas. The facility has implemented all of the standards of the industry, government and insurance advisors have required and requested. there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia inthe past five yearsthat have caused any deaths, injuries, ofsignificant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,sheltering in place, property damage or environmetal damage.Our staff understands the importance of safety not only for themselves but also the safety of the community and the environment.
