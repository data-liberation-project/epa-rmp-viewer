The same properties that make these chemicals so valuable in wastewater treatment also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them.  Safe handling procedures prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to our own personal health and our co-workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members o fthe community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide combined with the safety devices in herent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis wastewater treatment facility is a small facility, designed for 6 million gallons per day, with 2 wastewater holding ponds and is located 735 Cotton Road.  The primary purpose of this facility is to treat wastewater from Berwick, Patterson, Sewerage District No. 2 and Sewerage District No. 8 of St. Mary Parish.  The water is pumped into the facility through underground pipe.  The wastewater is aerated and mixed in the first basin and then enters a settling process in the second basin.  From this basin chlorine is added to the wastewater to kill any bacteria that is present.  The sulfur dioxide is added to the wastewater stream to minimize the amount of chlorine in the water.  The water is discharged into the Intracoastal Waterway or used as irrigation water for the Atchafalaya Golf Course.\n\nThe maximum amount of chemical that this facility keeps is eight 1-ton containers of chlorine and six 1-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are regulated substances.\n\nThe worst-case scenario of chlorine or sulfur dioxide is the total failure of one of the 1-ton containers resulting in a release of 20"

Due to the fact that the cylinders are constructed, tested and inspected under strict guidleines and routinely replaced by the chemical supplier, it is very unlikely that this will ever occur.  The distance to the endpoint of the lower toxicity limit for the worst-case scenario of chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3.0 and 3.1 miles, respectively.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  All employees undergo training in the emergency procedures associated with chlorine.  This facility has no reportable release of chlorine in the past five years.  This facility's emergency response plan is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In the case of an emergency the facility's employees are trained to contact the local fire department who will coordinate any necessary actions that need to take place."
