      "SummaryText": "\nFarmers Union Cooperative Assoc. of Bridgewater is a registered Anhydrous Ammonia dealer. We own a 18,000 gallon stationary storage tank located on our property on the west edge of Bridgewater. In this tank we store anhydrous ammonia for agricultural use.\n\nWe have not had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years. This can be attributed to our Accidental Release Prevention Program. We train our employees in preventive maintenance and the safe transfer of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to this, our facilities are inspected yearly by our insurance carrier and the SD Dept. of Agriculture. Any deficiencies, found by these inspections or our employees, are corrected immediately.\n\nOur Risk Management Plan was completed using government and industry standards for accidental release and the alternative release scenarios. We have as Emergency Action Plan in force coordinated with the Bridgewater Fire Dept. and the Local Emergency Planning Committee in conjunction with the McCook County Civil Defense in Salem, SD. Our employees are trained yearly in our Emergency Action Plan and several of our employees are members of the Bridgewater Fire Dept.\n\nWe are constantly looking at new technology and changes in industry standards for the transfer and storage of anhydrous ammonia and upgrade our facilities when they come to the market."
