The plant, converted  from a Tyson beef processing plant,  primarily manufactures butter from cream produced throughout the country. This facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency?s Risk Management Program rules under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe Risk Management Program rules require facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The plan requirements include submission of the risk management plan to include hazard assessments defining possible off-site impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, description of the facilities accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for West Point Dairy, West Point, Nebraska.\n\nFacility Snapshot\nThis West Point facility will start production sometime toward the end of April, 2008 and is scheduled to process 15 million gallons of cream into 58 million pounds of butter annually.\n\nImpact on the community\n?    West Point Dairy will employ approximately 90 Nebraska residents at a combined annual salary of approximately $2.5 million dollars.\n?    Although the amounts are unknown at this time, the dairy will purchase electicity, natural gas, and water from local utilities.\n?    Will purchase over $218 million dollars in raw  materials from all over the country.\n\nEmployee snapshot\nWest Point Dairy employees will be very involved in community activities. Many facility employees are active and participate in many public and community groups.

Therefore, under the EPA Risk Management Rule, the plant is a Program 3 facility with a Program 3 Prevention Program. The OSHA Process Safety Management /EPA Prevention Program consists of facility management policies and procedures which promotes and recognizes process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, and process hazardous chemical materials. The procedures address all aspects of plant activities including training, maintenance, operating procedures, process reviews, maintenance, safe work practices, incident investigation, audit, and other activities in a manner to provide controls to prevent errors, failures, and inadvertent changes in a process that could result in accidents.\n\nWest Point Dairy adheres to the requirements of Process Safety Management and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of Process Safety Management and EPA Prevention Programs.

Periodically the plan is practiced in a table top, classroom type setting, and also  drilled in mock emergencies including participation by outside responding agencies.\n \nSynopsis of Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\nThe Risk Management rule requires a hazard analysis for worst case and alternate case accidental release scenarios for regulated substances present in threshold quantities at the site.  For this facility, the regulated substances include anhydrous ammonia as a regulated toxic. The rule requires an analysis of the worst case toxic as that scenario affecting the greatest distance.  Alternate scenarios, for each regulated toxic, which are more likely events, must also be presented.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release-Ammonia\nThe Risk Management rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the worst case event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint of consideration.  This is a requirement of the rule regardless of whether the event is likely, or, could even reasonably occur.\n\nThe worst case release assumes, as required by the rule, that this entire amount is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of a tank. Since this facility is located in a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst case is so"

We are aware of no such failure of these tanks nor, even lesser failures of a nature that would provide for an accidental release of quantities less than indicated above.  Analysis of this scenario is required by the rule, and, as such, was completed.\n\nAlternate Case Toxics - Ammonia\nMore likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses. Significantly lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of such failures. This alternate release scenario consists of a valve leak, which discharges the contents of the pipe for 10 minutes prior to the emergency shut-off.  The effects of this scenario is identified in our Risk Management Plan submitted to EPA. \n \n5-Year Accident History\nThe Risk Management rule requires inclusion of the five-year accident history of the facility for all accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Since this is a new operation, the West Point Plant has had no qualifying accidental release in the past five years.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility which is facilitated by the EPA Prevention Program/OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Formal process hazard analysis will be conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously, as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
