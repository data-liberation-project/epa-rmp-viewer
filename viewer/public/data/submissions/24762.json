THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREATEST RISK OF RELEASE  COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANKS.  THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 176,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A  RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 76000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 7600 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5M/SEC. WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.2 MI. AFFECTING 672 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11908 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 5954 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 2 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3M/SEC WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .5 MILE AFFECTING 9 PEOPLE.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES WE UTILIZE RANGE FROM EMPLOYEE TRAINING TO EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE.  WE HAVE EXCESS FLOW VALVES, BACK CHECK VALVES, AND PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES ON OUR AMMONIA SYSTEM.  WE ALSO HAVE GAUGES TO TELL US WHEN THESE TANKS ARE FULL TO PREVENT THE OVER FILLING OF THESE TANKS WHICH IN TURN WOULD CREATE AN ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE.  WE INSPECT OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WE REVIEW OUR SAFETY POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INSTALLING BARRIERS TO HELP PREVENT VEHICULAR DAMAGE.  WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN CONSISTS OF NOTIFYING THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS THE LEPC IF A RELEASE OCCURS.  THE NUMBER TO CALL ARE 911 AND 515-828-2220 RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ROLE AS THE COMPANY WILL BE TO SECURE THE AREA UNTIL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARRIVE AND ASSIST THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBILE.  THIS IS OUR PLAN IF AN ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE SHOULD HAPPEN."
