              "Description": "7.0    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCHS - Rochelle recognizes that employee safety and health is a priority for the Plant.  CHS - Rochelle values the work performed by its contractors and believes contractors should implement and abide by workplace safety practices in order to protect the human health of Contractor employees, CHS - Rochelle?s employees, and the surrounding community, as well as the environment.  \n\nIt is the policy of CHS - Rochelle to prohibit the use, possession, sale, and distribution of alcohol, drugs, or other controlled substances at the workplace and to prohibit the presence of an individual with such substances in their body for non-medical reasons.  \n\nCHS - Rochelle requires that work and practices meet all applicable laws, codes, and regulations of the state where the work is to be performed as well as all OSHA requirements and applicable CHS - Rochelle safety programs.  All contractors must ensure that the employee safety is given a high priority in the conduct of their business and aggressively manage a safety and health program for their employees.\n\n\n\n7.1    Instructions before Starting Work\n\nCHS ? Rochelle requires all contractors to participate in an environmental, health, and safety orientation prior to working on site, which covers the applicable safe work practices.  By signing the Contractor Safety Orientation Form (Appendix D), the contractor representative agrees to abide by all safety requirements.  The CHS - Rochelle representative and the contractor's supervisor must discuss the scope of work to be performed.  The contractor's supervisor is responsible for obtaining information regarding special hazards and precautions necessary to perform the work in a safe manner and communicating the information obtained to all work site employees of the contractor.  \n\n\n\n7.2    Use of Owner?s Equipment and Materials\n\nThe use by contractor personnel of any CHS - Rochelle equipment, including but not limited to, cranes, powered industrial trucks, safety equipment, environmental monitoring equipment, medical equipment, lighting, mechanical, and electrical equipment, ladders, and scaffolding is prohibited unless permission is obtained from CHS - Rochelle.  \n\n\n\n7.3    Travel in the Plant\n\nContractor employees must use only the prescribed walkways, crossovers, or roadways.  Contractor employees are to obey all posted warning and traffic signs and yield to vehicle, pedestrians, and rail movement.  CHS - Rochelle encourages contractor employees to use seat belts when a vehicle is in operation.  All vehicles must be kept in a safe condition.  If audible back-up alarms are not provided, a person shall walk behind any vehicle backing where visibility is restricted.  Mobile equipment entering buildings must be preceded by a person on the floor.  Contract employees are advised that areas which are not specific work sites of the contractor are off limits.  Contract employees shall abide by local security procedures relative to admittance to the facility, parking, and transportation of employees to the work site.  While walking or working in the plant, contractor employees should be observant to:\n\n?    Moving equipment, such as trains, tractors, trucks, cranes etc.\n\n?    Uneven or slippery floors.\n\n?    Open pits or floor openings.\n\n?    Removable railings or gratings.\n\n?    Depressed tracks or loading areas.\n\n?    Rotating equipment and conveyors.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, when walking through the plant, use only designated aisles or walkways.  Observe all posted signs and do not take shortcuts.  Never enter a taped off area unless authorized.  Crossing over or under conveyor systems is prohibited.  When entering buildings, be alert to equipment movements.  Never walk under equipment loading operations and be attentive to equipment sirens, position, and movements.\n\nBefore crossing railroad tracks or roads where there may be moving equipment, be certain the track or roadway is clear in all directions.  Climbing on, under or over railroad equipment is prohibited.  When work is to be done near railroad tracks or near equipment that operates on tracks, certain safety rules must be followed, i.e. standard railroad rules regarding blue flags and blue lights or equipment lockout procedures.  A minimum of six feet clearance shall be maintained from the nearest rail along all railroad tracks and eight feet minimum along curved tracks.\n\n\n\n7.4    Employee Conduct\n\nContractor supervision shall at all times enforce strict discipline and maintain good order among its employees and shall not retain any unfit person or anyone not skilled in a work assignment.  Any employee of contractor that is objectionable or unsatisfactory to CHS - Rochelle shall be removed from the Work.\n\nContractor employees are advised of the following:\n\n1.    Prohibition on the use, possession, sale, and distribution of alcohol, drugs, or other controlled substances at the workplace and the presence of such substances in their or on their body for non-medical reasons; \n\n2.    Prohibition from bringing onto the CHS - Rochelle? property any firearms, fireworks or any other explosive material, a knife with a blade of more than 2 ?  inch length, or any weapon such as a blackjack, brass knuckles, razor, dagger etc.; except for:\n\na.    Employees authorized and / or issued knives specifically for use in the performance of their occupation; or\n\nb.    Law enforcement personnel present on the site.\n\n3.    Entry onto property constitutes consent to inspect Worker?s vehicle and personal effects while on CHS - Rochelle? property;\n\n4.    Refusal to permit inspection or violation of the policy identified in Item (1) of this Section will result in removal from the property.\n\n\n\n7.5    Contractor Safety and Environmental Program\n\nContractor must have a written safety program, which addresses the following:\n\n?    New employee orientation program\n\n?    Work Site employee orientation program\n\n?    Safety Training relative to the Tasks Performed and Equipment Used\n\n?    Substance abuse policy\n\n?    Work Site safety inspection and audit policy/procedures\n\n?    Emergency response (medical, fire, chemical spills)\n\n?    Personal protective equipment\n\n?    Accident investigation, analysis and control programs\n\nThe contractor's safety program must also address the following if applicable, to work performed by the contractor employees while on CHS - Rochelle property:\n\n    Confined Space Entry                Mobile Equipment\n\n    Crane Safety                    Electrical Safety    \n\n    Fall Protection                    Railroad Safety\n\n    Hazard Communication                Respiratory Protection\n\n    Hearing Conservation                Trenching/Excavating\n\n    Lockouts                    Vehicle Safety\n\n    Medical Surveillance & Exposure Monitoring    Bloodborne Pathogens\n\n    Fire Extinguisher Training            Personal Protective Equipment\n\nContractor employees working in an area deemed a ?covered process? under the PSM Program will be informed as to the PSM Plan for the CHS - Rochelle.  Contractor employees must be trained to meet requirements of OSHA and the requirements of the contractor's safety program and applicable Owner safety policies and procedures set forth in this Plan.  The contractor must designate one or more individuals employed by the contractor who are thoroughly familiar with applicable safety and health regulations and who are responsible for employee safety training to be responsible for overseeing Contractor personnel safety while on site.\n\nContractor employees shall comply with all applicable OSHA, EPA and other safety, health and environmental rules while performing work on CHS - Rochelle property.  CHS - Rochelle reserves the right to inspect work performed by contractor employees for compliance with OSHA requirements, and any deficiencies shall be promptly corrected.\n\n\n\n7.6    Personal Protective Equipment    \n\nThese basic requirements apply to all work areas, including operating, maintenance, and field areas at CHS - Rochelle.\n\n?    As minimum, hard hats, safety glasses with side shields, hearing protection, and suitable work shoes with safety toe must be worn.  Additional safety equipment may be required by the nature of the hazard present.  This may include, but is not limited to, respiratory protection, goggles, gloves, fall protection, and flame retardant clothing.\n\n?    Personal clothing suitable for work must be worn.  This includes long sleeve work shirts or jackets and properly fitting pants (preferably non-synthetic).  This clothing must fit snugly to prevent the possibility of becoming entangled in equipment or creating a tripping hazard.\n\nAny contractor employee failing to comply with the provisions set forth in this Section will be subject to removal from the work site at CHS - Rochelle?s sole discretion.  CHS - Rochelle will not be responsible for payment of the time after a violation of this Policy has been identified and removal from the site has been requested.  Failure of CHS - Rochelle to exercise this provision does not relieve the Contractor of the obligation to insure every employee complies with these requirements.\n\n\n\n7.7    Medical Treatment\n\nContractor supervision is to provide a system for first-aid treatment.  Contractor supervision is also responsible for establishing a plan to address major medical emergencies including the emergency transportation to a health care facility.  It is CHS - Rochelle recommendation that in the event of a severe injury, Contractor should contact 911.  All contract employees must report all injuries to their supervisor, and the Contractor Supervisor is to inform CHS - Rochelle of the injury.  Contractor employees are not to rely on CHS - Rochelle to provide any medical or ambulatory services.  In special situations, CHS - Rochelle personnel may give contractor employees assistance and/or treatment.  \n\n\n\n7.8    Reporting of Accidents\n\nContractor must submit a written report within 24 hours to CHS - Rochelle?s representative who monitors or coordinates contractor activities whenever a contractor employee is injured, is involved in an incident with property damage, or is involved in an event with serious injury potential.  (Verbal notification of fatal injuries or injuries requiring hospitalization must be made within 30 minutes of the incident).  A written follow-up report must include all of the information required on the OSHA Form 301 ? Injuries and Illnesses Incident Report.  The contractor is to make available at CHS - Rochelle's request all reports, findings or other documents relating to the contractor's investigation of the incident.  CHS - Rochelle reserves the right to conduct its own investigation of any incident occurring on CHS - Rochelle property.  Such an investigation may include inspection of the incident site, interviews of contract employees, the procurement of physical evidence, and the obtaining of written statements from contractor employees.\n\n\n\n7.9    Lockout/Tagout\n\nContractor employees shall not attempt to operate any CHS - Rochelle equipment unless specifically authorized.  Contractor employees must adhere to the requirements set forth under OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.147 (Lockout/Tagout).  Where equipment must be de-energized to prevent inadvertent activation, the contractor must consult with CHS - Rochelle's representative on the appropriate lockout procedures.  Contractor employees must not initiate energy reactivation or isolation of electrical, mechanical, or stored energy systems without consulting with CHS - Rochelle's representative.  Contractor employees shall not turn on any utility or motor without permission.  Contract employees, who may initiate lockout activities, must contact the Control Room (the centralized location for lockout/tagout devices) and must be provided with a standardized lock and an identification system that contains at least the individual's name and company affiliation.  If approved by the Control Room Supervisor, the Contractor?s locks may be used in the lockout/tagout procedures.  However, the use of the Contractor?s locks does not authorize changes to CHS - Rochelle?s lockout/tagout procedures.\n\nAll contractor employees involved are responsible for insuring the lockout procedures are followed.  If there are any switches or operating devices that cannot be locked, or there is any doubt as to how to lock out a piece of equipment, contractor employees must contact their supervisor for assistance.  CHS - Rochelle?s representative is to be consulted if any questions on appropriate lockout procedures exist.\n\nEmployees authorized to perform lockout shall be certain which switch, valve, or other energy isolating devices apply to the equipment being locked out.  Certain equipment may involve more than one energy source such as electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, steam or others.  In such instances, all energy sources must be de-energized, brought to a zero mechanical state, and locked out.  When performing lockout, consideration must be given to the following:\n\n?    Identification of all sources of energy - both kinetic energy (energy in motion) and potential energy (stored energy) that must be neutralized.\n\n?    Neutralization of all energy since stored energy that hasn't been neutralized could set a machine part in motion.\n\n?    Isolation of electrical power by breaking the circuit.  \n\n?    Lowering of all suspended parts to lowest (rest) position whenever possible.\n\n?    Blocking of movable parts.\n\n?    Venting of air pressure from pneumatic lines.\n\n?    Draining or bleeding hydraulic lines.\n\n?    Releasing or blocking spring energy.\n\n?    Attachment of a lock to the main energy source that has been placed into the \"off\" position or main shutoff valve that has been closed.  The safety lock must be locked in place and tested to be sure it is latched.  This is done to ensure that the safety lock cannot be removed by other employees.  If more locks are needed than what has been supplied, the employee must contact their supervisor.  Where there is more than one person locking out, a multiple lockout device must be used and each employee must attach their lock.  \n\n?    After the lockout has been completed, an attempt shall be made to start the equipment to insure it has been deactivated.\n\n?    Where equipment must be operated at intervals to complete the repair work, a written procedure should be established for removal and replacement of safety locks or provide for an equally safe alternative.  There must be clear and positive communications between the persons removing the lock and operating the equipment and the persons at the equipment who may be aligning or performing other work in conjunction with the repair.\n\n\n\n7.10    Utilities and Electricity\n\nContractor employees must not make any connection to electrical, gas, steam, air, oxygen, acid, water, or process line unless authorized by CHS - Rochelle's representative.  Contractor employees are not permitted to activate or deactivate any valve or switch associated with CHS - Rochelle's utilities unless authorized by CHS - Rochelle.  Contractor employees are not to enter motor rooms or substations unless authorization is granted by CHS - Rochelle.\n\nIf work is to be performed on or near power lines, collector rails or any other high voltage equipment (600 V or greater), the contractor must confer with the CHS - Rochelle representative to review the precautions the contractor will take to insure contract employees do not contact live electrical installations.  Any contractor employee who has not been appropriately trained is prohibited from working on or near high voltage equipment, collector rails, or power lines.  Contractor supervision must insure appropriate lockout procedures are followed by all contractor employees for all electrical and mechanical equipment and hydraulic systems.\n\nWhere contractor employees are uncertain as to a work procedure or the energy state of any equipment, the work is to be terminated until contractor supervision can assure the safety of employees is not jeopardized.\n\n\n\n7.11    Confined Space Entry Program\n\nNo contractor employee may enter a permit-required confined space without permission from CHS - Rochelle's representative.  If the contractor's work requires entry into a confined space, a Confined Space Permit must be obtained from CHS - Rochelle.  The contractor must obtain information concerning the hazards identified that are associated with a confined space.  The contractor's Confined Space Entry Program and Training must comply fully with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.146 Permit Required Confined Spaces prior to entry into a confined space at CHS - Rochelle.  Should contractor employees confront or create a hazard that was not covered in the Confined Space Permit, contractor employees must immediately cease work and contact CHS - Rochelle representative.\n\n\n\n7.12    Excavation and Trenching\n\nContractor must provide a system to protect employees in excavations four (4) feet or more in depth or in an excavation where an employee's torso, head, or shoulders will be below the ground.  Contractor must provide a Competent Person, as defined in OSHA Standard 1926 Sub Part P (Excavation, Trenching, and Shoring), for all excavation work performed on CHS - Rochelle's property.\n\nBefore any excavating is started, contractor must check with the CHS - Rochelle representative for all known underground utilities such as conduit, pipelines, tanks, etc.  The contractor shall provide all necessary sheeting, shoring or bracing as may be required for safe operation.  Excavations must be guarded with railings and barricades of substantial construction and shall be erected by the contractor.  Lanterns or other illuminated warning devices must be placed at night.\n\nEmployees shall be protected from excavated or other materials or equipment that could pose a hazard by falling or rolling into excavations.  Protection shall be provided by placing and keeping such materials or equipment at least two (2) feet from the edge of excavations, or by the use of retaining devices that are sufficient to prevent materials or equipment from falling or rolling into excavations, or by a combination of both if necessary.\n\nDaily inspections of excavations, the adjacent areas, and protective systems shall be made by a competent contractor representative for evidence of a situation that could result in possible cave-ins, indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions.  An inspection shall be conducted by the competent person prior to the start of work and as needed throughout the shift.  Inspections shall also be made after every rainstorm or other hazard increasing occurrence.\n\nWhere the competent person finds evidence of a situation that could result in a possible cave-in, indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions, exposed employees shall be removed from the hazardous area until the necessary precautions have been taken to ensure their safety.\n\nA stairway, ladder, ramp, or other safe means of egress shall be located in trench excavations that are 4 feet (1.22 m) or more in depth so as to require no more than 25 feet (7.82 m) of lateral travel for employees.\n\n\n\n7.13    Roof and Above Ground Work\n\nAt the beginning of each job before initially going on any plant roof, tank or vessel roof, CHS - Rochelle's representative must be contacted.  The contractor must assess the condition of the roof prior to performing work and must evaluate potential exposure to electrical utilities.  Certain roofs present special hazards due to their inability to bear weight.  The contractor must initiate additional safety practices when structural weaknesses are suspected regardless of the materials of construction.  Safety harnesses and fall protection systems must be worn while on any roof within the facility unless an adequate safety plan has been developed.  No material shall be thrown or dropped from plant roofs unless permission has been granted.  When working overhead, the area below shall be roped off or other equivalent measures taken to protect workers in the area.  \n\n\n\n7.14    Fall Protection\n\nEmployees at heights of 4 feet or more above a lower level must be protected by the use of guardrail systems, warning line systems, hole covers, personal fall arrest systems, or other OSHA compliant system.  In addition, employees above dangerous equipment, such as rotating machinery, electrical equipment, and process tanks, must be protected from falling into the equipment by guardrail systems, equipment guards, warning line systems, or personal fall arrest systems.\n\nSpecifications for guardrail systems, hole covers, warning line systems, and personal fall arrest systems can be found in the OSHA Standard for Fall Protection in Construction, 29 CFR 1926.502.  In addition, specifications for open sided floors, platforms, runways, guardrail systems, stairs, portable wood and metal ladders, fixed ladders, and scaffolding can be found in the OSHA General Industry Standards, 29 CFR 1910.\n\nFall Protection is also specifically required in the following sections of this plan:  \n\n    Section 7.5 ? Contractor Safety and Environmental Program\n\n    Section 7.6 ? Personal Protective Equipment\n\n    Section 7.12 ? Excavation and Trenching\n\n    Section 7.13 ? Roof and Above Ground Work and \n\n    Section 7.15 ? Aerial Manlifts. \n\n\n\n7.15    Aerial Manlifts\n\nContractor employees must be trained as appropriate on the safe operation of aerial manlifts.  The operator must be trained to obey all warnings, cautions, and operating instructions posted on the machines.\n\nWhile operating any manlift, all safety equipment must be worn.  Safety harnesses are mandatory and must be worn on the platform with the lanyard as short as possible and tied off to the basket.  Both feet must be on the platform floor and the use of ladders, boxes, steps or planks to gain additional reach are not permitted.  The manufacturer's recommended maximum capacity for the platform must never be exceeded.  All controls should be operated with a smooth, slow, and even pressure.  Hesitation or uneven response of controls should be reported immediately to contractor supervision and the operation stopped.\n\nBefore raising, telescoping, lowering, or swinging the boom, the areas above and below must be clear of all obstructions and personnel.  A flashing light must be attached to the vehicle when working inside buildings.  If the boom of any manlift is raised or extended into the operating space of an overhead crane, an appropriate safety procedure to protect the manlift from being contacted by the overhead crane must be implemented (See Section 7.16).  Clearance around the turntable must be checked before swinging the boom.\n\nSafe clearance must be maintained from all electrical lines or collector rails.  A minimum of at least 20 feet between any part of the machine and any high voltage electrical line or apparatus should be maintained.  If adequate clearance cannot be assured, contractor supervision is to contact the CHS - Rochelle representative to establish a safe work procedure.\n\n\"Men Working Above\" signs, or caution/danger tape should be posted whenever overhead work is being performed.  All personnel on the ground must maintain at least a six (6) feet distance from the boom or turntable while operating.\n\nThe manlift must be on a firm and level surface to work from elevated positions.  If the platform is not level, it must be adjusted when the boom is in the full down position.\n\n\n\n7.16    Hot Work\n\nContractor employees are not to perform burning, welding, or other hot work such as grinding, cutting, drilling, soldering, brazing etc. in areas having the potential for combustibles until the location and work procedure is approved by CHS - Rochelle's representative and a Hot Work Permit is issued.  After approval is obtained, contractor employees shall adhere to strict process safety management practices to ensure that the safety of persons and property is not jeopardized.  Adequate fire prevention measures shall be taken before hot work begins.  All flammable and combustible materials shall be relocated or appropriately covered for a radius of 35 feet of the burning or welding area.  Where appropriate, the area is to be wetted prior to and during hot work.  The contractor shall provide a fire watch person if required by CHS - Rochelle.  Special precautions are necessary when hot work is conducted on process vessels, tanks or piping, and ?covered PSM processes? must be addressed in accordance with the PSM Plan.  Covered PSM processes are as follows:\n\n1.    Ammonia Charging and Above Ground Storage Tank (AST);\n\n2.    Ethanol and Denaturant ASTs;\n\n3.    Ethanol Loadout and Denaturant Offloading; and\n\n4.    Beer column to 190-Proof and 200-Proof storage.\n\nContractor employees shall understand that:\n\n?    The use of welding or burning equipment is prohibited unless authorized to do so by CHS-Rochelle.\n\n?    Employees who routinely burn or weld should wear flame retardant clothing, gloves, eye protection, and helmets as appropriate for the conditions of the work.\n\n?    Gas cylinders must be handled carefully and not used as rollers or supports.  While on CHS - Rochelle property, all cylinders are to be appropriately stored and secured.  Cylinders should never be moved without the valve cover caps in place and should never be placed in a confined area where gas could collect.  The use of cylinder valve protection caps for lifting and the use of magnets or slings to move cylinders is prohibited.  Gas cylinders are to be clearly and legibly identified with the name of the contents.\n\n?    The use of defective hoses, torches, gauges, lines, electrode holders, and cables is prohibited.\n\n?    The use of oil and grease on fittings or oxygen equipment is prohibited.\n\n?    Contractor employees are not to use torches to thaw pipelines.\n\n?

Welding machines, transformers, and generators shall be shut off when work is stopped.\n\n?    Welders must keep welding cable and other equipment away from high voltage power cables, steam lines, and gas lines.  Placing welding cable on or about passageways, ladders, stairs, and moving vehicles should be avoided.\n\n \n\n7.17    Fire Prevention\n\nContractor supervision must make one person responsible for work site fire safety.  This person is to establish procedures for controlling fire hazards that are consistent with CHS - Rochelle's fire and emergency action plan.  Fire hydrants, fire hose reels, fire hose boxes, and other fire fighting equipment must not be blocked or obstructed by the contractor.  Fire protection equipment must not be used for any other purpose.  All contractor personnel in the work site area must be aware that CHS - Rochelle representatives shall be immediately notified in the event of a fire.\n\n\n\n7.18    Exposure to Chemical and Physical Agents    \n\nContractors must provide their own monitoring equipment capable of continuously monitoring and alarming for the specific chemical substances potentially present at any work site.  Contractors are prohibited from using CHS - Rochelle's equipment for such purposes unless permission from CHS - Rochelle is obtained.  When work is to be performed in any area, contractors are responsible for evaluating exposures to any chemical or physical agents and, based upon such evaluations, institute the necessary control measures or practices that are deemed to be appropriate.\n\nContractors must utilize their own respiratory protection, emergency escape and resuscitation equipment unless written permission from CHS - Rochelle is obtained.  Contractor supervision shall also be responsible for reporting to the primary evacuation assembly area in the event of an accidental release of toxic gas and be able to effectively administer first-aid/CPR to contract employees.\n\n\n\n7.19    Hazardous Communication\n\nContractors will be informed as to the presence of hazardous materials associated with the process within the area where they will be working.  Contractors will also be informed of the Emergency Evacuation Plan in the event of an emergency release.  \n\nContractors must maintain an inventory and Material Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals brought onto CHS - Rochelle's property.  All containers of chemical products must be properly labeled and stored.  The contractor must remove all unused materials including chemicals brought onto CHS - Rochelle's property upon completion of work.  CHS - Rochelle's representative reserves the right to prohibit the use or request the removal of any chemical substance deemed to be unacceptable.  \n\n \n\n7.20    Environmental Control\n\nA spill or unintentional release into the environment may give rise to a variety of reporting and clean-up requirements, generally depending upon what was spilled, the amount spilled; and the time, location and effects of the spill.  Contractor employees must immediately report any spill or unintentional release to the environment to the CHS - Rochelle representative and immediately follow all federal reporting requirements and state reporting requirements.  The contractor must then immediately take steps to initiate containment and clean-up of any spill or unintentional release and complete all clean-up and disposal of spill material and/or residues in accordance with all applicable federal and state requirements.  The contractor must take immediate steps to contain spills or releases to the environment.  Cleanup of any spill or release to the environment will be undertaken after approval and direction from CHS - Rochelle, and the costs associated with those cleanup activities will be the direct responsibility of the contractor.  Reporting of contractor spills or releases to the environment will be made by CHS - Rochelle on behalf of the contractor and after consultation with the contractor.\n\nAny penalty or other liability arising from a contractor's spill or release to the environment shall be borne by the contractor, and the contractor shall indemnify CHS - Rochelle for any liability and expense imposed upon CHS - Rochelle for the contractor?s actions leading to potential wa\n\n",

Contractor employees must be trained to meet requirements of OSHA and the requirements of the contractor's safety program and applicable Owner safety policies and procedures set forth in this Plan.  The contractor must designate one or more individuals employed by the contractor who are thoroughly familiar with applicable safety and health regulations and who are responsible for employee safety training to be responsible for overseeing Contractor personnel safety while on site.\n\nContractor employees shall comply with all applicable OSHA, EPA and other safety, health and environmental rules while performing work on CHS - Rochelle property.  CHS - Rochelle reserves the right to inspect work performed by contractor employees for compliance with OSHA requirements, and any deficiencies shall be promptly corrected.\n\n\n\n7.6    Personal Protective Equipment    \n\nThese basic requirements apply to all work areas, including operating, maintenance, and field areas at CHS - Rochelle.\n\n?    As minimum, hard hats, safety glasses with side shields, hearing protection, and suitable work shoes with safety toe must be worn.  Additional safety equipment may be required by the nature of the hazard present.  This may include, but is not limited to, respiratory protection, goggles, gloves, fall protection, and flame retardant clothing.\n\n?    Personal clothing suitable for work must be worn.  This includes long sleeve work shirts or jackets and properly fitting pants (preferably non-synthetic).  This clothing must fit snugly to prevent the possibility of becoming entangled in equipment or creating a tripping hazard.\n\nAny contractor employee failing to comply with the provisions set forth in this Section will be subject to removal from the work site at CHS - Rochelle?s sole discretion.  CHS - Rochelle will not be responsible for payment of the time after a violation of this Policy has been identified and removal from the site has been requested.  Failure of CHS - Rochelle to exercise this provision does not relieve the Contractor of the obligation to insure every employee complies with these requirements.\n\n\n\n7.7    Medical Treatment\n\nContractor supervision is to provide a system for first-aid treatment.  Contractor supervision is also responsible for establishing a plan to address major medical emergencies including the emergency transportation to a health care facility.  It is CHS - Rochelle recommendation that in the event of a severe injury, Contractor should contact 911.  All contract employees must report all injuries to their supervisor, and the Contractor Supervisor is to inform CHS - Rochelle of the injury.  Contractor employees are not to rely on CHS - Rochelle to provide any medical or ambulatory services.  In special situations, CHS - Rochelle personnel may give contractor employees assistance and/or treatment.  \n\n\n\n7.8    Reporting of Accidents\n\nContractor must submit a written report within 24 hours to CHS - Rochelle?s representative who monitors or coordinates contractor activities whenever a contractor employee is injured, is involved in an incident with property damage, or is involved in an event with serious injury potential.  (Verbal notification of fatal injuries or injuries requiring hospitalization must be made within 30 minutes of the incident).  A written follow-up report must include all of the information required on the OSHA Form 301 ? Injuries and Illnesses Incident Report.  The contractor is to make available at CHS - Rochelle's request all reports, findings or other documents relating to the contractor's investigation of the incident.  CHS - Rochelle reserves the right to conduct its own investigation of any incident occurring on CHS - Rochelle property.  Such an investigation may include inspection of the incident site, interviews of contract employees, the procurement of physical evidence, and the obtaining of written statements from contractor employees.\n\n\n\n7.9    Lockout/Tagout\n\nContractor employees shall not attempt to operate any CHS - Rochelle equipment unless specifically authorized.  Contractor employees must adhere to the requirements set forth under OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.147 (Lockout/Tagout).  Where equipment must be de-energized to prevent inadvertent activation, the contractor must consult with CHS - Rochelle's representative on the appropriate lockout procedures.  Contractor employees must not initiate energy reactivation or isolation of electrical, mechanical, or stored energy systems without consulting with CHS - Rochelle's representative.  Contractor employees shall not turn on any utility or motor without permission.  Contract employees, who may initiate lockout activities, must contact the Control Room (the centralized location for lockout/tagout devices) and must be provided with a standardized lock and an identification system that contains at least the individual's name and company affiliation.  If approved by the Control Room Supervisor, the Contractor?s locks may be used in the lockout/tagout procedures.  However, the use of the Contractor?s locks does not authorize changes to CHS - Rochelle?s lockout/tagout procedures.\n\nAll contractor employees involved are responsible for insuring the lockout procedures are followed.  If there are any switches or operating devices that cannot be locked, or there is any doubt as to how to lock out a piece of equipment, contractor employees must contact their supervisor for assistance.  CHS - Rochelle?s representative is to be consulted if any questions on appropriate lockout procedures exist.\n\nEmployees authorized to perform lockout shall be certain which switch, valve, or other energy isolating devices apply to the equipment being locked out.  Certain equipment may involve more than one energy source such as electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, steam or others.  In such instances, all energy sources must be de-energized, brought to a zero mechanical state, and locked out.  When performing lockout, consideration must be given to the following:\n\n?    Identification of all sources of energy - both kinetic energy (energy in motion) and potential energy (stored energy) that must be neutralized.\n\n?    Neutralization of all energy since stored energy that hasn't been neutralized could set a machine part in motion.\n\n?    Isolation of electrical power by breaking the circuit.  \n\n?    Lowering of all suspended parts to lowest (rest) position whenever possible.\n\n?    Blocking of movable parts.\n\n?    Venting of air pressure from pneumatic lines.\n\n?    Draining or bleeding hydraulic lines.\n\n?    Releasing or blocking spring energy.\n\n?    Attachment of a lock to the main energy source that has been placed into the \"off\" position or main shutoff valve that has been closed.  The safety lock must be locked in place and tested to be sure it is latched.  This is done to ensure that the safety lock cannot be removed by other employees.  If more locks are needed than what has been supplied, the employee must contact their supervisor.  Where there is more than one person locking out, a multiple lockout device must be used and each employee must attach their lock.  \n\n?    After the lockout has been completed, an attempt shall be made to start the equipment to insure it has been deactivated.\n\n?    Where equipment must be operated at intervals to complete the repair work, a written procedure should be established for removal and replacement of safety locks or provide for an equally safe alternative.  There must be clear and positive communications between the persons removing the lock and operating the equipment and the persons at the equipment who may be aligning or performing other work in conjunction with the repair.\n\n\n\n7.10    Utilities and Electricity\n\nContractor employees must not make any connection to electrical, gas, steam, air, oxygen, acid, water, or process line unless authorized by CHS - Rochelle's representative.  Contractor employees are not permitted to activate or deactivate any valve or switch associated with CHS - Rochelle's utilities unless authorized by CHS - Rochelle.  Contractor employees are not to enter motor rooms or substations unless authorization is granted by CHS - Rochelle.\n\nIf work is to be performed on or near power lines, collector rails or any other high voltage equipment (600 V or greater), the contractor must confer with the CHS - Rochelle representative to review the precautions the contractor will take to insure contract employees do not contact live electrical installations.  Any contractor employee who has not been appropriately trained is prohibited from working on or near high voltage equipment, collector rails, or power lines.  Contractor supervision must insure appropriate lockout procedures are followed by all contractor employees for all electrical and mechanical equipment and hydraulic systems.\n\nWhere contractor employees are uncertain as to a work procedure or the energy state of any equipment, the work is to be terminated until contractor supervision can assure the safety of employees is not jeopardized.\n\n\n\n7.11    Confined Space Entry Program\n\nNo contractor employee may enter a permit-required confined space without permission from CHS - Rochelle's representative.  If the contractor's work requires entry into a confined space, a Confined Space Permit must be obtained from CHS - Rochelle.  The contractor must obtain information concerning the hazards identified that are associated with a confined space.  The contractor's Confined Space Entry Program and Training must comply fully with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.146 Permit Required Confined Spaces prior to entry into a confined space at CHS - Rochelle.  Should contractor employees confront or create a hazard that was not covered in the Confined Space Permit, contractor employees must immediately cease work and contact CHS - Rochelle representative.\n\n\n\n7.12    Excavation and Trenching\n\nContractor must provide a system to protect employees in excavations four (4) feet or more in depth or in an excavation where an employee's torso, head, or shoulders will be below the ground.  Contractor must provide a Competent Person, as defined in OSHA Standard 1926 Sub Part P (Excavation, Trenching, and Shoring), for all excavation work performed on CHS - Rochelle's property.\n\nBefore any excavating is started, contractor must check with the CHS - Rochelle representative for all known underground utilities such as conduit, pipelines, tanks, etc.  The contractor shall provide all necessary sheeting, shoring or bracing as may be required for safe operation.  Excavations must be guarded with railings and barricades of substantial construction and shall be erected by the contractor.  Lanterns or other illuminated warning devices must be placed at night.\n\nEmployees shall be protected from excavated or other materials or equipment that could pose a hazard by falling or rolling into excavations.  Protection shall be provided by placing and keeping such materials or equipment at least two (2) feet from the edge of excavations, or by the use of retaining devices that are sufficient to prevent materials or equipment from falling or rolling into excavations, or by a combination of both if necessary.\n\nDaily inspections of excavations, the adjacent areas, and protective systems shall be made by a competent contractor representative for evidence of a situation that could result in possible cave-ins, indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions.  An inspection shall be conducted by the competent person prior to the start of work and as needed throughout the shift.  Inspections shall also be made after every rainstorm or other hazard increasing occurrence.\n\nWhere the competent person finds evidence of a situation that could result in a possible cave-in, indications of failure of protective systems, hazardous atmospheres, or other hazardous conditions, exposed employees shall be removed from the hazardous area until the necessary precautions have been taken to ensure their safety.\n\nA stairway, ladder, ramp, or other safe means of egress shall be located in trench excavations that are 4 feet (1.22 m) or more in depth so as to require no more than 25 feet (7.82 m) of lateral travel for employees.\n\n\n\n7.13    Roof and Above Ground Work\n\nAt the beginning of each job before initially going on any plant roof, tank or vessel roof, CHS - Rochelle's representative must be contacted.  The contractor must assess the condition of the roof prior to performing work and must evaluate potential exposure to electrical utilities.  Certain roofs present special hazards due to their inability to bear weight.  The contractor must initiate additional safety practices when structural weaknesses are suspected regardless of the materials of construction.  Safety harnesses and fall protection systems must be worn while on any roof within the facility unless an adequate safety plan has been developed.  No material shall be thrown or dropped from plant roofs unless permission has been granted.  When working overhead, the area below shall be roped off or other equivalent measures taken to protect workers in the area.  \n\n\n\n7.14    Fall Protection\n\nEmployees at heights of 4 feet or more above a lower level must be protected by the use of guardrail systems, warning line systems, hole covers, personal fall arrest systems, or other OSHA compliant system.  In addition, employees above dangerous equipment, such as rotating machinery, electrical equipment, and process tanks, must be protected from falling into the equipment by guardrail systems, equipment guards, warning line systems, or personal fall arrest systems.\n\nSpecifications for guardrail systems, hole covers, warning line systems, and personal fall arrest systems can be found in the OSHA Standard for Fall Protection in Construction, 29 CFR 1926.502.  In addition, specifications for open sided floors, platforms, runways, guardrail systems, stairs, portable wood and metal ladders, fixed ladders, and scaffolding can be found in the OSHA General Industry Standards, 29 CFR 1910.\n\nFall Protection is also specifically required in the following sections of this plan:  \n\n    Section 7.5 ? Contractor Safety and Environmental Program\n\n    Section 7.6 ? Personal Protective Equipment\n\n    Section 7.12 ? Excavation and Trenching\n\n    Section 7.13 ? Roof and Above Ground Work and \n\n    Section 7.15 ? Aerial Manlifts. \n\n\n\n7.15    Aerial Manlifts\n\nContractor employees must be trained as appropriate on the safe operation of aerial manlifts.  The operator must be trained to obey all warnings, cautions, and operating instructions posted on the machines.\n\nWhile operating any manlift, all safety equipment must be worn.  Safety harnesses are mandatory and must be worn on the platform with the lanyard as short as possible and tied off to the basket.  Both feet must be on the platform floor and the use of ladders, boxes, steps or planks to gain additional reach are not permitted.  The manufacturer's recommended maximum capacity for the platform must never be exceeded.  All controls should be operated with a smooth, slow, and even pressure.  Hesitation or uneven response of controls should be reported immediately to contractor supervision and the operation stopped.\n\nBefore raising, telescoping, lowering, or swinging the boom, the areas above and below must be clear of all obstructions and personnel.  A flashing light must be attached to the vehicle when working inside buildings.  If the boom of any manlift is raised or extended into the operating space of an overhead crane, an appropriate safety procedure to protect the manlift from being contacted by the overhead crane must be implemented (See Section 7.16).  Clearance around the turntable must be checked before swinging the boom.\n\nSafe clearance must be maintained from all electrical lines or collector rails.  A minimum of at least 20 feet between any part of the machine and any high voltage electrical line or apparatus should be maintained.  If adequate clearance cannot be assured, contractor supervision is to contact the CHS - Rochelle representative to establish a safe work procedure.\n\n\"Men Working Above\" signs, or caution/danger tape should be posted whenever overhead work is being performed.  All personnel on the ground must maintain at least a six (6) feet distance from the boom or turntable while operating.\n\nThe manlift must be on a firm and level surface to work from elevated positions.  If the platform is not level, it must be adjusted when the boom is in the full down position.\n\n\n\n7.16    Hot Work\n\nContractor employees are not to perform burning, welding, or other hot work such as grinding, cutting, drilling, soldering, brazing etc. in areas having the potential for combustibles until the location and work procedure is approved by CHS - Rochelle's representative and a Hot Work Permit is issued.  After approval is obtained, contractor employees shall adhere to strict process safety management practices to ensure that the safety of persons and property is not jeopardized.  Adequate fire prevention measures shall be taken before hot work begins.  All flammable and combustible materials shall be relocated or appropriately covered for a radius of 35 feet of the burning or welding area.  Where appropriate, the area is to be wetted prior to and during hot work.  The contractor shall provide a fire watch person if required by CHS - Rochelle.  Special precautions are necessary when hot work is conducted on process vessels, tanks or piping, and ?covered PSM processes? must be addressed in accordance with the PSM Plan.  Covered PSM processes are as follows:\n\n1.    Ammonia Charging and Above Ground Storage Tank (AST);\n\n2.    Ethanol and Denaturant ASTs;\n\n3.    Ethanol Loadout and Denaturant Offloading; and\n\n4.    Beer column to 190-Proof and 200-Proof storage.\n\nContractor employees shall understand that:\n\n?    The use of welding or burning equipment is prohibited unless authorized to do so by CHS-Rochelle.\n\n?    Employees who routinely burn or weld should wear flame retardant clothing, gloves, eye protection, and helmets as appropriate for the conditions of the work.\n\n?    Gas cylinders must be handled carefully and not used as rollers or supports.  While on CHS - Rochelle property, all cylinders are to be appropriately stored and secured.  Cylinders should never be moved without the valve cover caps in place and should never be placed in a confined area where gas could collect.  The use of cylinder valve protection caps for lifting and the use of magnets or slings to move cylinders is prohibited.  Gas cylinders are to be clearly and legibly identified with the name of the contents.\n\n?    The use of defective hoses, torches, gauges, lines, electrode holders, and cables is prohibited.\n\n?    The use of oil and grease on fittings or oxygen equipment is prohibited.\n\n?    Contractor employees are not to use torches to thaw pipelines.\n\n?    Burning or welding on process tanks, gas lines or vessels must only be conducted after obtaining a Hot Work Permit.\n\n?    Welding machines, transformers, and generators shall be shut off when work is stopped.\n\n?    Welders must keep welding cable and other equipment away from high voltage power cables, steam lines, and gas lines.  Placing welding cable on or about passageways, ladders, stairs, and moving vehicles should be avoided.\n\n \n\n7.17    Fire Prevention\n\nContractor supervision must make one person responsible for work site fire safety.  This person is to establish procedures for controlling fire hazards that are consistent with CHS - Rochelle's fire and emergency action plan.  Fire hydrants, fire hose reels, fire hose boxes, and other fire fighting equipment must not be blocked or obstructed by the contractor.  Fire protection equipment must not be used for any other purpose.  All contractor personnel in the work site area must be aware that CHS - Rochelle representatives shall be immediately notified in the event of a fire.\n\n\n\n7.18    Exposure to Chemical and Physical Agents    \n\nContractors must provide their own monitoring equipment capable of continuously monitoring and alarming for the specific chemical substances potentially present at any work site.  Contractors are prohibited from using CHS - Rochelle's equipment for such purposes unless permission from CHS - Rochelle is obtained.  When work is to be performed in any area, contractors are responsible for evaluating exposures to any chemical or physical agents and, based upon such evaluations, institute the necessary control measures or practices that are deemed to be appropriate.\n\nContractors must utilize their own respiratory protection, emergency escape and resuscitation equipment unless written permission from CHS - Rochelle is obtained.  Contractor supervision shall also be responsible for reporting to the primary evacuation assembly area in the event of an accidental release of toxic gas and be able to effectively administer first-aid/CPR to contract employees.\n\n\n\n7.19    Hazardous Communication\n\nContractors will be informed as to the presence of hazardous materials associated with the process within the area where they will be working.  Contractors will also be informed of the Emergency Evacuation Plan in the event of an emergency release.  \n\nContractors must maintain an inventory and Material Safety Data Sheets for all chemicals brought onto CHS - Rochelle's property.  All containers of chemical products must be properly labeled and stored.  The contractor must remove all unused materials including chemicals brought onto CHS - Rochelle's property upon completion of work.  CHS - Rochelle's representative reserves the right to prohibit the use or request the removal of any chemical substance deemed to be unacceptable.  \n\n \n\n7.20    Environmental Control\n\nA spill or unintentional release into the environment may give rise to a variety of reporting and clean-up requirements, generally depending upon what was spilled, the amount spilled; and the time, location and effects of the spill.  Contractor employees must immediately report any spill or unintentional release to the environment to the CHS - Rochelle representative and immediately follow all federal reporting requirements and state reporting requirements.  The contractor must then immediately take steps to initiate containment and clean-up of any spill or unintentional release and complete all clean-up and disposal of spill material and/or residues in accordance with all applicable federal and state requirements.  The contractor must take immediate steps to contain spills or releases to the environment.  Cleanup of any spill or release to the environment will be undertaken after approval and direction from CHS - Rochelle, and the costs associated with those cleanup activities will be the direct responsibility of the contractor.  Reporting of contractor spills or releases to the environment will be made by CHS - Rochelle on behalf of the contractor and after consultation with the contractor.\n\nAny penalty or other liability arising from a contractor's spill or release to the environment shall be borne by the contractor, and the contractor shall indemnify CHS - Rochelle for any liability and expense imposed upon CHS - Rochelle for the contractor?s actions leading to potential wa\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCHS - Rochelle (formerly Illinois River Energy, LLC) operates a fuel ethanol plant located in Rochelle, Ogle County, Illinois.  The plant is permitted to produce 133 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year.  In accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, CHS - Rochelle has completed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for covered processes that contain an RMP listed toxic or flammable substance at a quantity exceeding the corresponding program applicability threshold. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCHS - Rochelle is committed to the protection of its employees, the community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant to make the fuel ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of CHS - Rochelle to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of natural gasoline, it is the policy of CHS - Rochelle to notify the National Response Center, Illinois Emergency Management Agency, and the Local Emergency Planning Committees for Ogle County, Illinois, and to evacuate all non-essential employees and all visitors from the facility.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain up to 30 percent pentane, up to 30 percent isopentane, and up to 5 percent butane, which are RMP regulated flammable substances.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be approximately 1,032,075 pounds (lbs) including approximately 30"
