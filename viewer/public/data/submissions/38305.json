      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the North Hollywood facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe North Hollywood Wells Chlorination Station is located at 11805 Vanowen Street, North Hollywood, California. This facility chlorinates well water before being supplied to parts of the San Fernando Valley.  The station consists of a chlorination room, a chlorine storage room, an instrument room, and a two-ton capacity chlorine scrubber in the basement.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of six one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the North Hollywood Wells chlorine building.  Four of these chlorine containers are connected to the chlorination process to feed liquid and gaseous chlorine and two others are stored as spares.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of ch"

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP North Hollywood Wells facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operation, two chlorine 1-ton containers are manifolded together into a liquid header that connects to the evaporators.  These containers are equipped with Halogen actuators on the angle valves and feed liquid chlorine under pressure.  The actuators will close the angle valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  Two additional ton containers with actuators are connected through a gas supply header.  They bypass the evaporators, serving as an automatic backup when the primary containers run dry or the evaporator shuts down due to a low temperature condition. Space is allocated in the room for the storage of two additional containers that are not provided connections to the system.  \n\nThe liquid chlorine passes from the containers through the evaporators where it is vaporized in a water bath.  The gaseous chlorine then proceeds to one of the three chlorinators that regulate the flow of chlorine.  From there, gas then travels under vacuum to the injectors.\n\nThere are four injectors located in an underground vault which draw chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is piped to diffuser tubes located in the water distribution pipelines.\n\nResidual chlorine analyzers monitor residual chlorine downstream of the diffusers. \n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorine storage room and the chl"

The detectors activate an alarm system which includes:  (1) flashing red lights over the entry door to the buildings, (2) an audible alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nThe station has installed a caustic solution scrubber actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm which can neutralize up to 4,000 lb of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak. \n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  The chlorine scrubber has two pumps to supply caustic to the scrubber.  One pump operates and the other is a spare.  The station is powered by two separate power supplies. \n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily. A response team coordinated from DWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) responds to any trouble alarms which may occur. Access to the facility is through gates, which are kept locked all the time.\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n* Comprehensive safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\n* Comprehensive preventive maintenance program.\n* Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation and review.\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n* Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n* High level of training of the operators and maintenance staff.\n* Implementation of an incident investigation, inspection, and auditing program using qualified staff.\n\nChemical-s"

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was compiled on the chlorine process. Specifications for the chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; and safe upper and lower pressures for the chlorination facility are on file at the facility.  DWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nHazard Review \n\nIn 1991, a detailed hazard review was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999.  In April 2004 a hazard review was again performed for the whole chlorination system and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process. A list of recommended actions was developed in April 2004 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\n\nA seismic walkthrough was recently completed based on the LEPC Region 1 guidance document, and recommendations were provided to DWP staff for their evaluation and implementation. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nDWP has prepared written operating pro"

Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the City of Los Angeles Fire Department may be solicited to aid in handling a chlorine release.  \n\nAs part of the emergency response program, the DWP has developed and implemented an emergency response plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The following elements are included:\n\n(a) An emergency response plan, maintained at the stationary source and at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) containing:\n\n* Organizational structure (chain-of-command) and responsibilities of various DWP "

The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine handling system.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the DWP.  Additional 25 changes to further improve chlorine safety were identified in April 2004, when the hazard review was completed for the facility. It is expected that these recommendations will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system"
