A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in The alternative release scenario section below.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nA credible worst-case scenario, formulated in accordance with USEPA guidance, was selected as the Prairie Farms alternative release scenario. This scenario involves a one-inch diameter hole from a break in the high pressure liquid ammonia piping on the roof of the facility.\r\n\r\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nPrairie Farms is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance. Based on this commitment, the Plant General Manger has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program. The Plant General Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, Prairie Farms maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia. The multifaceted program includes the use of:\r\nAmmonia gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\r\nProcess safety information to document the safe process design;\r\nProcess hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major anhydrous ammonia release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\n\r\nIn the event that an ammonia release does occur, Prairie Farms has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Dubuque Fire Department. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the Dubuque Fire Department, who would dispatch specially trained personnel to the facility.\r\n\r\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\r\n\r\nPrairie Farms continually works to safely manage the hazards of anhydrous ammonia to protect the community we serve and the employees working for us.

The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning and product cooling for milk products. The system also provides cooling to generate chilled water or glycol through flooded heat exchangers which in turn supplies secondary media and/or direct product or process cooling. Ammonia contained within the refrigeration system is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations. The maximum inventory of ammonia in exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.  \r\n\r\nPrairie Farms is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection via the Dubuque Fire Department.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nPrairie Farms has conducted an offsite consequence analysis as required by the EPA regulations, including an extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the largest maximum inventory in a single vessel or container over a ten minute period, assuming worst case meteorological conditions). Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected.\r\n\r\nThis type of release is not considered credible from the standpoint that an event of this nature would require the catastrophic failure of the vessel, resulting in a sudden release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.
