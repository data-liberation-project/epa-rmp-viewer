      "SummaryText": "This facility was formerly owned by Bionol Clearfield, LLC and was subsequently purchased by Pennsylvania Grain Processing, LLC (PGP). Prior to the acquisition the facility was idled for a period of time. The facility started up under PGP ownership on May 8, 2012. The facility performed a PSM/RMP compliance audit on June 4, 2013. During that audit all elements of the RMP were reviewed; therefore that is the date provided in the RMP as the most recent review for the elements of the RMP. \n\n\n\nPennsylvania Grain Processing (PGP) utilizes more than the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) in their ethanol production processes.  Therefore, the facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.150.  The anhydrous ammonia system at the facility is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements. In addition to the ammonia, the facility also utilizes natural gasoline as a denaturant to make the ethanol it produces unfit for human consumption. The exact composition of the natural gasoline varies greatly, as it is a direct byproduct of the refining process. However, since there is a possibility that the material will contain butane or pentane in excess of 1 percent and the material has an NFPA flammability rating of 4, the facility is also reporting the denaturant process. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Executive Summary.  The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR Part 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\n\nA?68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPGP has documented emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.  This plan has been endorsed by PGP staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the facility. PGP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, whic"

      "SummaryText": "h must be followed in the event of an anhydrous ammonia leak.  All personnel involved in handling anhydrous ammonia are trained with regard to ammonia safety and accident prevention.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Pennsylvania Grain Processing, LLC facility.  The regulated substance handled is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPGP has a documented Prevention Program for the anhydrous ammonia process that documents release prevention measures.  These prevention measures include elements such as Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit and Contractors.  \n\n    \n\nPGP employees who are involved in anhydrous ammonia operations and maintenance are trained in specific procedures regarding handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(d) Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe PGP facility has not had any reportable releases of any regulated substances since operation commenced.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nPGP is a non-responding facility, as defined by USEPA (29 CFR Part 40 CFR Part 311).  Therefore, PGP has developed an Emergency Action Plan to ensure employee safety instead of an Emergency Response Program, as allowed by 40 CFR Part 68.90(b). The PGP Emergency Action Plan outlines actions required to respond to an anhydrous ammonia emergency and has coordinated this plan with Clearfield County Emergency Management and Clearfield Fire Department. Fire Department personnel are the designated first responders in the event of an anhydrous ammonia emergency at the PGP facility.  PGP employees are not designated responders to an anhydrous ammonia release.  As specified in 40 CFR Part 68.90, PGP"

      "SummaryText": "'s Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR Part 68.90(b) and therefore, the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR Part 68.95.\n\n\n\nA?68.155(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the compliance audit conducted in June of 2013. Recommended improvements for SOPs and training were made during that audit and the facility is in the process of implementing those recommendations. "
