The Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  As our LEPC and SEPC are one and the same, we have coordinated our program with the local fire department.  A representative group from the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAt this time we continue to maintain our current safety management systems.  In addition, we are investigating the possibilities for containment of our railcar-unloading site and we continue to improve the computerized process control system as outlined in our hazard review.  We also anticipate improving our training programs in the area of specific maintenance tasks."

We are committed to operating & maintaining all of our processes in a safe & responsible manner.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to:\r\n\r\nComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\r\nReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety, & environmental improvements.\r\n\r\nOur complete Health, Safety, & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility.\r\n\r\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and to ensure protection of the environment.  Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \r\n\r\n2.

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, vacuum or mechanically crushed, trimmed, and prepared for shipment to customers.\r\n\r\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck, and is stored in 2 tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.  The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system.\r\n\r\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 210,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  Our management systems for our TDI process address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\nContractor Awareness\r\nHot Work Permitting\r\nMonthly Workplace Inspection by members of the JHS&E Team\r\nSafety Information\r\nHazard Reviews of our Processes\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining\r\nEquipment Maintenance Programs\r\nRMP Compliance Audits\r\nAccident/Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have an established Isocyanate Control Program that outlines both the hazards of handling toluene diisocyanate and the controls that are in place to reduce those hazards.  Controls are in place to reduce exposure to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.
