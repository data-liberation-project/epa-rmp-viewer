      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Santee Cooper Regional Water System's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies show that the SCRWS is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety and adheres to all applicable regulations.  The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as emergency recognition, evacuation routes, emergency medical treatment and procedures for notifying local emergency response personnel (i.e., Fire Department, etc.).  It is the RWS's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe SCRWS has only one (1) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine with a threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  Chlorine is utilized as a disinfectant in the water treatment process.  The chlorine is received at the facility in one ton containers.  The maximum inventory of chlorine containers stored on site at the SCRWS does not exceed sixteen (16). The SCRWS is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements of the RMP rule.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nSantee Cooper Regional Water System has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are key to the prevention program:\n1.    Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.\n2.    Comprehensive process hazard analysis are conducted to ensure that hazards a"

Operating procedures have been developed and implemented which describe tasks to be performed, date to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, emergency operating procedures and safety and health precautions to be taken.\n4.    Employee training program is in effect to ensure that the employees of SCRWS are properly trained and aware of all safety practices, hazards, emergency procedures and maintenance procedures.\n5.    An on going mechanical integrity program is in place to ensure safe process operation.\n6.    Incident investigation procedures are in place to ensure that all unplanned events affecting process safety are properly investigated in a timely manner to identify the causes of the incident and to implement corrective action.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe SCRWS has had and excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to the effective release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during the last five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Santee Cooper Regional Water System has a written emergency response plan that deals with accidental releases of chlorine from the process.  The plan establishes minimum requirements and procedures to follow during and after a chorine emergency.  These procedures include adequate first aid and medical treatment, plant evacuation routes as well as proper notification of local emergency response officials who will respond to an emergency (i.e., fire department, LEPC).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\nThe last process safety hazard Analysis was performed in November 2002 and no changes were recommended beyond minor RMP manual clean ups."
