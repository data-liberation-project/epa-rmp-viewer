FACILITY POLICY.  The owners, management and employees of River Valley Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Nodaway County LEPC, local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION. This facility was put into operation in the fall of 2000.  It is a branch of River Valley Ag, located in Hopkins, Missouri.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored in this area would be 170,000 pounds.  This figure includes our main storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the bulk storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the bulk storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 3.3 miles.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a 1\"  transfer hose followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released with this scenario would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of the Sta"

      "SummaryText": "ndards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n    1.  Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds,\n          the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n         The National Emergency Response Center @ 800/424-8802\n\n    2.  At the earliest practical moment after discovery (within 24 hours) and determining the amount \n        of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:\n\n        The Missouri Department of Natural Resources @ 573/634-2436\n\n\n8.  PLANNED CHAGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess our prevention and safety programs.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations  at this time.\n\n9.
