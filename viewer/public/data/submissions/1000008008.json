This substance is used in the Mannich process to produce water treatment polymers. Substances that are used by Polychemie that are regulated as either toxic substances or flammable substances by 40 CFR Part 68 and are above the minimum threshold quantity are as follows:\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n      Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored as a 60 percent solution in water. The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately\n140,000 pounds (82,000 pounds pure dimethylamine).\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with\nchemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are: \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management Systems Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\n\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\n     Operating Procedures\n     Emergency Procedures\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\n     24-hour Emergency Communications\n\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)requirements for the chemical dimethylamine, such as:\n\n     Mechanical Integrity - Preventive Maintenance of Equipment\n     Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n     Management of Change\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n     Incident Investigation\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility al"

No\naccidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or\nsignificant property damage on-site or off-site; or resulted in off-site evacuations or sheltering in\nplace. \n\n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to\npromote this improvement include updating and implementing safe work practices such as:\nconfined space entry permits; hot work permits; pipe entry permits; lock-out tag-out procedures;\nand hazard communication procedures.\n                       "
