The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of West Central Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.   If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients..\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 392,445 pounds in our storage tank and nurse tanks.  \n\n3.  The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n    NOT INCLUDED\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  In addition, Iowa Dept. of Ag Rules.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History.\n\nA.  There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nDid not cause any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, , sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.                                                                                                                                                                               The release did involve an evacuation of about 50 people.\n\n6.  The emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA s"
