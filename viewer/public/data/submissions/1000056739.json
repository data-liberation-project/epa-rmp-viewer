This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \r\n\r\nLineage - Riverside Building #3 Facility's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a Risk Management Program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  It is also policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nLineage - Riverside Building #3 Facility is located at 2356 Fleetwood Drive, Jurupa Valley. California 92509.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is a mixture of mostly urban and some rural areas. \r\nThe regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia. The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFICATIONS STEPS\r\n\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage - Riverside Building #3 Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for CalARP Program and the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and Cal-OSHA PSM.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to CalARP/RMP Program Level 3 and CalOSHA-PSM.\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information"

The Facility Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the local responding units, County of Riverside, Environmental Health, HAZMAT Team and local Fire Department.  A current copy of the EAP and Crisis Management Plan, that includes ammonia responses, can be found with the General and Maintenance Managers.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Facility has submitted a Hazardous Material Business Plan via County of Riverside Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Material Business Plan Electronic Submittal Portal on 12/8/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.  These studies include:\r\n\u00bfA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed in March 15/16, 2016.\r\n\u00bfA Hazard Assessment, performed in April 2016.\r\n\u00bfA Seismic Assessment was performed on March 2016.\r\n\u00bfA Compliance Audit was performed on March 14-17 2016. \r\n\r\nAny outstanding recommendations from these studies and the target completion date or closure have been provided within each individual report."
