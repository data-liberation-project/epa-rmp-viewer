This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical distribution.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include  and Chlorine.  Chlorine is only stored for distribution.                                      .\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 13050.00 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp(TM).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine.  In this scenario 150 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 1 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 1.1% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrativ"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.6 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSouthchem Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 06/03/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Southchem Inc maintains written operating procedures.
