The legal authority for the CalARP Program is the California Health and Safety Code (H&SC), Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2 (commencing with Section 25531).  The California Office of Emergency Services has issued implementation regulations under the California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  Scott Semiconductor Gases (Scott) is regulated under the CalARP Program, due to on-site storage of six chemicals that exceed the RMP applicability threshold in a process.  A process is defined as ?any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\n\n?Facility\nScott is located at 5121 Brandin Court in Fremont, California (see Figure ES-1, Site Location Map).  The facility is comprised of two buildings.  The H Building is used for compressed gas cylinder storage and gas processing.  The B Building houses the administration offices, the laboratory, a clean room, and additional inert compressed gas cylinder storage.\n\nChemical Inventories\nThe chemicals at Scott that exceed the RMP applicability threshold are ammonia, arsine, boron trichloride, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and nitric oxide.  The maximum intended inventories and program levels are listed in Table ES-1.\n\nTable ES-1 Applicable RMP-Regulated Substances at Scott\nChemical Name CAS Number Maximum Intended Inventory (SCF) Covered Process State or Federal Applicability Program Level\n\n     Ammonia          7664-41-7                      3,500 SCF "

Only Boron Tri-Chloride and Hydrogen Chloride are processed on site, the remaining 4 RMP chemicals are for temporary storage, awaiting shipment. Processing operations include transfilling, downfilling, and are completed in an enclosed room inside the H-building with a negative pressure vented to a caustic scrubber, rated at 30,000 CFM. The alarm system is located in the exhaust and will detect and alarm with any corrosive fumes exceeding 2.5 PPM level.\n\nSince the last RMP submittal, the H-Building has been up-graded to include;\n                Increasing scrubber capacity from 12,000 CFM to 25,000 CFM\n                Addition of 2-roof fans rated at 25,000 each.\n                Three separate enclosures have been added for the processing of corrosives, flammables and Diboranes(1%               concentration or less).\n                Five processing cabinets for Corrosives, flammables and oxidizers.\n                46 new alarm points have been added to the gas monitoring system with automatic contact with SONITROL security.\n            "

The release is assumed to occur while the cylinder is in the H- Building storage area.  The entire quantity is assumed to be released over a period of 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is the quantity contained in the cylinder divided by the duration of the release.  A summary of the worst-case release scenarios is provided in this RMP report.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for each RMP process is assumed to be a failure of a valve on or a connection to a cylinder containing the greatest quantity of the compressed gas.  The release is assumed to occur while the cylinder is inside the storage and processing building, where the doors would be closed in the event of a leak.  It is estimated that the release could be stopped within 15 minutes of occurrence; however, it is likely that the entire quantity of compressed gas in the cylinder would be released before the release could be stopped.  Therefore, the release rate to the atmosphere is the quantity contained in the cylinder divided by the duration of the release, adjusted to account for the mitigation provided by the enclosed building.  The alternative-case release scenarios for each covered process are summarized\n \nPrevention Program 3\nThe ammonia, boron trichloride, chlorine, and hydrogen chloride covered processes are subject to Program 3 prevention program requirements.

The ERT consists of 12 fully equipped members that attend yearly training by certified personnel and attend a minimum of quarterly plant training. I am currently seeking to coordinate training exercise with the City of Fremont ERT group.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nScott is committed to providing a safe place of business for the employees and the surrounding community.  This RMP Manual documents the programs and procedures in place at Scott to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  The RMP provisions are intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals from the facility and include such measures as a system hazard review, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and updates.\nScott will address and resolve all of the action items identified in the Process Hazard Analyses for each RMP-covered process.  In the future, to ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain and improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, process hazard ana"
