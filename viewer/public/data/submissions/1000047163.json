This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our facility.  This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The facility has not had nor does it anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However, if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility, in cooperation with local agencies, are trained to respond, minimize and eliminate any exposure which would occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Springbrook Plant and Gas Lift is located near Williston, North Dakota and is a facility which receives raw natural gas from well production.  The raw gas is dehydrated and treated to remove contaminants.  Marketable gas is delivered via pipelines.  Natural gas liquids are extracted and stored on site.  The extracted natural gas liquids include ethane, propane, butane and a pentane natural gasoline mixture delivered to market via transportation vehicles.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is a release of a flammable mixture resulting in a failure of a single natural gas liquids storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere having an offsite impact.  The NGL release scenario was selected because the four facility 90,0"

A single NGL storage tank release is evaluated because it is unlikely all four tanks would simultaneously fail.  This type of scenario is unlikely to occur.  In addition, qualified individuals operate this facility daily.  The equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP*Comp&trade; was used to calculate the release scenario.  The worst case release method for a flammable mixture, the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 psi, was used in evaluating this scenario.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAn established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per corporate safety guidelines.  Personnel having specific responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are aptly trained in those procedures as well as the required safety work practices.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSafe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations consistent with industry practice and to meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and wellbeing of employees, facility contractors and the surrounding area.\n\n&#8195;\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThe Springbrook Plant and Gas Lift is a greenfield facility and has no history of releases of listed Hazardous Substances which have resulted in offsite effects.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Springbrook Plant and Gas Lift has a written emergency response procedure to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.

The overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency responders including local law enforcement and the Rio Blanco County Emergency Management.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through training, which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a reoccurring schedule and employees and contractors are given the most up-to-date information available.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices.\n\n"
