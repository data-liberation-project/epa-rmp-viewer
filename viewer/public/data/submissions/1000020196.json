              "Description": "The DDVP process has been designed to prevent the release of bromine. The bromine storage tank is  located within a concrete dike for containment. The storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm and reductant shut-down systems to ensure that the level is maintained below maximum volume.  The process is continually monitored and bromine monitors are located within the process and around the perimeter to detect and provide an early warning for bromine vapors.  The presence will set offan audible alarm. A smaller bromine storage tank was put into service January 2011 and the RMP was updated for this reason. ",

The plan has been prepared in accordance with section 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials (AHMs).  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by the AMVAC Chemical Corporation, Axis Plant, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP regulation and the relevent portions of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management regulations.\n\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Mobile Manufacturing Center.  It was purchased from Dupont by AMVAC on 5-18-2001.  The necessary documentation for the facility to comply with the RMP legislation was a part of that purchase agreement.  All of the Hazard and Operability Studies and Process Hazard Analysies were originally documented by Dupont and they have all been reviewed AMVAC in preparation of this RMP.  The AMVAC Axis plant and the Dupont MMC are on a common site.  All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency teams from both companies.\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\n1.  Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\n2.  Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\n3.

Safe conditions and full environmental regulartory compliance will be maintained at all of its facilities.  All unsafe conditions/actions will be immediately corrected and management notified.\n\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Mission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation's Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) departments are committed to ensuring that facility operations are conducted in full compliance with existing environmental, health and safety regulations.  To achieve this we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n2.0  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural pesticides at its plant located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the Dupont facility located on the common site.  The facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations, peripheral tanks and various ancilliary equipment.\nThe AMVAC Axis plant has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.  The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\n\nAs per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4) the RMP must be updated no later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process above a threshold quantity. AMVAC plans to begin production of METAM/KPAM in Fall 2008 and two of the raw materials used in this process are covered chemicals. This updated RMP includes information to satisfy this requirement.

Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in Fortress Synthesis\n2.  Phosphorous Trichloride, CAS 7719-12-2 used in Fortress Synthesis and also in K500/550 Synthesis\n3.  Hydrogen Sulfide, CAS 7783-06-4 used in Fortress Synthesis\n4.  Bromine, CAS 7726-95-6 used in DDVP/Dibrom process\n5.  Carbon Disulfide, CAS 75-15-0 used in METAM/KPAM process\n*Listed Flammable Substances:  \n1.  Methylamine, CAS 74-89-5 used in METAM/KPAM process\n\nThe Accutely Hazardous Material associated with the METAM/KPAM process is carbon disulfide. Carbon Disulfide is loaded from iso-containers into storage tank within concrete dike. The storage tank is equipped with level control device. A shutdown interlock on high level will close valve in the unload line. Unload pump will shut down on low flow (dry run protection). Loss of instrument air, electricity or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations.\n\nThe Accutely Hazardous Material associated with the DDVP/Dibrom process is bromine. The bromine is stored onsite in a storage tank, located in an enclosed concrete dike.  Bromine arrives onsite via railcar or truck.  The storage tank is equipped with level control devices that will automatically shut off supply of bromine into the tank. \n\n3.0  The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s):\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Carbon Disulfide was considered.For the purpose of conducting Offsite Consequence Analysis, absolute worst case and alternative release scenarios were selected.  Worst case scenarios are mandated by the RMP rule.  For the regulated chemicals used at AMVAC these assumed a total failure of all systems in place and a total release of the chemical inventory.  The criteria used to choose an alternative release scenario is an attempt to more closely define a serious release episode that could conceivably occur, bu"

These scenarios include the following:\n\nThe worst case release scenario for Bromine was considered.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario for covered Toxic Substances:\nCarbon Disulfide has been considered as a toxic substance considered for this scenario.  EPA Dispersion Model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used for this determination.  An estimate of 315,000 pounds was released @ 73F, in a diked area 3510 sf, with 3 ft walls. The model predicted release rate to outside air @ 369 pounds per minute, evaporation time : 814 minutes; topograpgy urban; toxic endpoint: 0.16 mg/l (basis ERPG-2), the distance to endpoint: 2.4 miles.The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the carbon disulfide storage tank (V-303) with 30,000 gallon capacity. 315,000 pounds of carbon disulfide would be released into its concrete dike.  The event would have off-site consequenses.  An event of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. \n\nBromine has also been considered as a toxic substance considered for worst case scenario.  The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the bromine storage tank containing 145,000 pounds into its concrete dike.  The event would have off-site consequenses.  An event of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios for each covered Toxic Substance:\nAn alternate release scenario for carbon disulfide (METAM/KPAM process) would be a leak to develop in the transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor, resulting in 200 gallons of carbon disulfide spilled onto concrete floor. ALOHA 5.4.1 dispersion model was used to estimate alternative scenario releases for carbon disulfide. An evaporating puddle over 25 square feet (200 gallons), with stability class D was used as input. An estimate of 500 pounds wa"

The solution leaks into the concrete containment dike for 20 minutes before the leak is isolated and the flow stopped.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario for Flammable substances:\nMethylamine has been considered as a flammable substance considered for this scenario.  The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the carbon disulfide solution (50%) storage tank (T-301 or T-302) each with 38,000 gallon capacity. RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used for this determination. An estimate of 140,000 pounds (vapor cloud explosion) with wind speed 1.5 m/s and stability class G, @ 77F, resulted in an estimated  impact distance of .4 miles. An incident of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios for each covered Flammable Substance:\nA methylamine leak develops in the transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor, resulting in 200 gallons of methylamine spilled onto concrete floor. ALOHA 5.4.1 dispersion model was used to estimate alternative scenario releases for methylamine. An evaporating puddle over 25 square feet (200 gallons), with stability class D was used as input.
