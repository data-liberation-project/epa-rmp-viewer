(SGRRI) operates a hazardous waste treatment and storage facility (TSDF) in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste license issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  SGRRI strives to conduct its business and operations in strict conformity with all applicable laws, and in a safe and responsible manner.  SGRRI has always placed the highest priority on the health and safety of its employees and members of the community in which it operates.\n\nSGRRI may be subject to the provisions of the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Requirements because regulated toxic and flammable liquids may be present in quantities which may on occasion exceed the regulatory thresholds for these substances. Accordingly, SGRRI has prepared a Risk Management Plan under the U.S. EPA's predictive filing provisions.  SGRRI will not exceed the threshold quantities for toxic gases and flammable gases.\n\nSGRRI's accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The SGRRI facility is designed, constructed, inspected, maintained and operated in a manner so as to minimize the risk of exposure to employees and the public to hazardous materials managed at the site, and in conformity with all governmental regulations.\n\nSGRRI has a comprehensive inspection plan which requires daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections of its processes, equipment and management practices.\n\nSGRRI has a Contingency Plan which prescribes procedures to be followed in the event of a fire or release at the facility.  The Contingency Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state and federal emergency response officials of incidents, and specifies arrangements which are made with emergency responders to ensure an effective response in the event of an emergency.\n\nSGRRI has a training plan wh"

Included in the facility training plan are training modules which instruct employees on the hazards of the regulated substances stored at the site, the procedures for evacuation from the facility, procedures for responding to releases, and procedures for notification of incidents to both facility personnel and offsite emergency responders.  In addition to the initial training that all employees receive, each employee receives refresher training on an annual basis.\n\nRisk Management System \n\nSpring Grove Resource Recovery has developed a management system to implement and maintain compliance with the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and related chemical safety and emergency response programs.  This management system identifies lines of responsibility for the entire program and each of its key elements, as described below.  \n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     Facility General Manager\n     Facility Compliance Manager\n\n2.  Off-Site Hazard Assessment\n     Facility Compliance Manager \n\n3.

These chemicals are not routinely stored at the facility in quantities exceeding the threshold planning quantities.  Cooperating local response agencies are informed of the actual facility inventories upon request.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSGRRI receives, temporarily stores, consolidates, and ships materials that are classified as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  A review of the records over the past several years indicate that portions of the waste streams may contain greater than one percent of one or more substance"

An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\n\nSGRRI's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan.  The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard.  By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), SGRRI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety or welfare of the environment.  SGRRI's record in this regard has been exceptional and its overall contribution to the protection of human health and the environment far surpasses the risks associated with the type of activities performed at the facility.\n\nThe specific elements of SGRRI's Contingency Plan include the following:\n\nA general description of the facility operations and the types of hazardous wastes handled at the facility.\n\nA list of the SGRRI emergency coordinators who are responsible for overseeing implementation of the Contingency Plan, and their responsibilities.\n\nCriteria for implementing the Contingency Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Procedures, including identification and assessment of an imminent or actual emergency, response procedures for facility personnel, and notification requirements.\n\nA list of emergency equipment.\n\nCoordination agreements between SGRRI and local and state officials.\n\nAn evacuation plan.\n\nIncident notif"

Personnel training is necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety.  SGRRI's training plan achieves this goal.  These programs are all documented so that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is available to employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Facility Emergency Coordinators when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community.  All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at this site lead to operations that meet or exceed the state and federal regulatory requirements applicable to the facility's operations."

These wastes may be temporarily stored on-site and then consolidated with other similarly classified waste streams or they may be directly transferred to other TSDF's for processing.  Flammable and toxic wastes are stored in separate areas.\n\nFlammable wastes are pumped from the drums and consolidated into larger tanks that contain  mixtures that have a NFPA rating of 3 or less.  Therefore, once a regulated flammable substance is pumped into a storage tank, it is no longer subject to ARP.  \n\nToxic substances that are processed are temporarily stored in containers.\n\nThe EPA risk management regulation identifies three levels of requirements.

These procedures are detailed in SGRRI's RCRA Part B hazardous waste license.  The procedures include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nAn inspection program which requires daily, weekly, monthly and annual inspections of process equipment, alarm systems, and management practices, with a procedure for documenting and correcting any deficiencies identified in inspections.\n\nA standard"
