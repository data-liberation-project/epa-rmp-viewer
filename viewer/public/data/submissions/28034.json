Founded in 1924, Univar USA Inc. supplies the water and waste treatment market, food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUnivar USA Inc. is a member of the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by Univar USA Inc. are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Univar USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUnivar USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to Univar USA Inc. facility personnel.  Univar USA Inc. responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders such "

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe Bunola Pennsylvania site stores, handles and delivers a variety of hazardous and non-hazardous chemical products to wholesale customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and New York.  Cylinders of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are packaged and handled at inventory levels above the threshold planning quantity of 2500 and 5000 lbs respectively. The typical inventory level for chlorine totals approximately 564850 lbs. in cylinders and up to 1080000 lbs in railcars. The typical inventory level for sulfur dioxide totals approximately 38000 lbs. A containerized 70% Hydrofluoric acid solution is also handled at the facility above the threshold planning quantity of 1000 lbs. The typical inventory level for 70% Hydrofluoric acid solution is 30,000 lbs.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario for the site would involve a total container failure from a railcar resulting in a release of 180,000 lbs of chlorine according to the EPA proscribed release protocol. This would result in a release of 180,0000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minute time period. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 25 miles. An additional Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario would involve a total container failure from a cylinder with a release of 2000 lbs of either sulfur dioxide or chlorine.  Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately 7.4 miles. An additional Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario would involve a total container failure with a release of 500 lbs of 70% hydrofluoric acid.  Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of approximately .62 mi"

Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of .29 miles. A second Alternate Case Release Scenario would involve a 50 lb. release of sulfur dioxide due to a leak during repackaging, product transfer or storage container. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of .29 miles. An additional Alternative Case Release Scenario would involve a 100 lb. release of 70% Hydrofluoric acid solution. Air dispersion modeling projects an affected area and distance to endpoint of .19 mile\n\n\nGENERAL PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAs outlined previously, Univar USA Inc. is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and utilizes this program to meet the prevention program requirements under RMP.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the following:\n1.The maintenance of minimal practical inventories.\n2. Employee training and operating procedures.\n3. Employee release detection and mitigation activities.\n4. Equipment and containers designed to meet appropriate regulatory guidelines  \n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe site has experienced no accidents as specified in 40 CFR Part 68 related to the containerized storage of chlorine, 70 % hydrofluoric acid solution or sulfur dioxide in the previous 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAn emergency contingency plan has been prepared and made available to local emergency response agencies. Allegheny County Emergency Planning Committee is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. In addition, a agreement has been formalized with Weavertown Environmental Inc. and Clean Harbors Inc, emergency response contractors, to provide on site and off site emergency response services in the event of"
