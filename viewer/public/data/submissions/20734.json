IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. AQUA AMMONIA IS RECEIVED AND STORED FOR THE BLENDING INTO MIXED-GRADE FERTILIZERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY STORED WOULD BE 140600 POUNDS IN OUR 20000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANKER TRUCK HOLDING 44,400 POUNDS. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SENARIO WOULD BE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A LIQUID OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 42600 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT IS 1.66 MILES. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY(OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A RUPTURE DISK/RELIEF VALVE. THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT IS .06 MILES. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF AQUA AMMONIA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF AQUA AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THE FACILITY HAS PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE  EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III. SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS IS AN ON GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY. EVALUTIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS."
