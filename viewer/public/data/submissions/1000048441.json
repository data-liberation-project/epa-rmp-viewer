The initial system maintains an inventory of approximately 12,800 pounds of ammonia with a maximum capacity of 13,000 pounds of ammonia, and the second refrigeration system is designed for a maximum inventory of 20,000 pounds of ammonia. \n\n\n\nEach refrigeration system utilizes a separate engine room in which most of the refrigeration equipment, including vessels, pumps, and compressors are housed. Condensers are mounted on the roof of each engine room and the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Assessment was updated based on the installation of the new refrigeration system prior to startup in January 2003. Since the ammonia inventory in the new system is designed to be 19,900 the Worst Case Scenario was updated to account for the potentially greater risk versus the first refrigeration system. The potentially-impacted population for each scenario was re-estimated using the most recent data from the 2000 census.  The population and environmental receptors were also investigated and documented based on current information.\n\n\n\n?    Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n\n\n    Scenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel (Low Stage Suction Accumulator) - 19,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The enclosure of the ammonia engine room provides a passive mitigation that limits the release rate to the atmosphere.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters per second wind speed, and F visibility.  The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in urban conditions.

Further details regarding the Worst Case Scenario can be found in the Hazard Assessment report maintained in Volume IV of the PSM/RMP at the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\n?    Worst Case Release Result Summary\n\n\n\nTo ensure conservative results, the reported Alternative Release Scenario was not changed from the initial RMP submitted in 1999, as the impacts from the previous scenario were potentially greater. \n\n\n\n    Scenario Description: A release of ammonia resulting from a 1/4 inch diameter hole in a pipe.  The release rate of ammonia doe to the pressure of the tank is 134 pounds per minute.   The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability. The Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables were used to determine the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.

No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release. \n\n\n\nACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.   Much of the safety of the systems is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of each system.  For example, the Bashas' Distribution Center facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\n\n\nBashas' maintains an on-going contract with a professional refrigeration service firm.  The refrigeration contractors make regular preventative maintenance visits to the facility, ensuring the refrigeration equipment is maintained in a good state of repair.

These safety features in each system include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shutdown systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves to protect the vessel's integrity during extreme pressure conditions. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110 \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as the basis for the facility's maintenance program.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia accidents at the facility, including any reportable releases during the previous 5 year period (since 2003).  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bashas' Distribution Center has an Emergency action plan in effect at the facility.
