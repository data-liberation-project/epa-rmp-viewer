The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency action plans are coordianted with the fire department and the Wilkes EMA.  The Washington Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP / PSM training session for this system.  \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe Facility has completed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and subsequent updates/revalidations for this process and has developed an action plan for consideration.\r\n\r\nImprovement actions to be considered primarily focus on site security measures including improved monitoring and inspection access.  Other considerations include improvements to minimize off-site migration of butane in the event of a release especially in the cold season."

If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Washington Fire Department as well as the Wilkes County LEPC, as necessary.

On-site personnel consist of truck transport drivers during off loading activities and period Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals representatives.\r\n\r\nThe Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Washinton Terminal is a butane transfer facility (specifically, rail car to trauck transfer tanker).  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and eight (8) 31,000 - gallon storage tanks (railcars).  This is the maximum capacity of the railspur.  \r\n\r\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one (1) 31,000 (butane capacity) - gallon storage tank car when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (most likely what could effect offsite receptors) scenario is a BLEVE incident involving one (1) railcar.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (5 kw/m2-40 sec.) effects public receptors.  THis scenario was selected based on the potential to impact receptors offsite (largest quantity released).\r\n\r\nThe Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals Washinton Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protections Agency's (EPA) accident prevention tules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Operat"
