It is the intent of the Greensboro Terminal to incorporate the most recent procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2008) to the extent feasible.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Greensboro Fire Department as well as the Guilford County LEPC.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services (Greensboro Ambulance) and Moses Cone Hospital.  This facility trains its employees to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Greensboro Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and one 89,715 gallon butane storage tank.\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's single 89,715 gallon butane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The facility's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Greensboro Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Guilford County Emergency Management.  The Greensboro Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\nMotiva Enterprises, LLC looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Greensboro Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.  The Greensboro Terminal is currently considering a formal flaring procedure in the event the maintenance or repair activities require complete butane removal.  Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
