Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nJCI is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that facilities continuously identify methods to provide the safest working environment possible to its employees and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance/procedure manuals, which are available to all employees. This facility stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in employee training programs, and in written materials available at the facility. This facility's safety and environmental programs include monthly safety meetings of all employees. JCI has an environmental manual and a safety manual that cover general environmental and safety best practices and compliance topics. Each employee at this facility has access to the environmental and safety manuals that cover topics specific to this facility. There are regularly scheduled safety and environmental audits conducted by facility management, and periodic safety and environmental audits of the facility conducted by JCI corporate personnel. This risk management program document has been prepared to meet the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program regulations as stated in 40 CFR Part 68 (Appendix A), as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program regulations.\n\n2.

Chemicals are brought on site in bulk quantities (railcars, tank trucks, etc.), repackaged into smaller containers, and then transported to customers on an as-needed basis. Any residual compressed gas is absorbed in an appropriate solution and sold as product. The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n3.  The Worse-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios \nThe WCS for toxic substances at this facility is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a single 90-ton chlorine railcar. This is the scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a chlorine toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/1). Chlorine is a dense toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure at atmospheric temperature. For the WCS release analysis, the following assumptions were made: a ground-level release of 180,000 pounds of liquid chlorine over 10 minutes; generally flat, unobstructed (rural) terrain surrounding the facility; and atmospheric conditions of 1.5 meter per second (mps) wind speed, F stability class, and 77'F ambient temperature. Although there are numerous installed control measures that, in an actual event, would mitigate the release, no credit for mitigation measures was taken into account for this scenario as required by the RMP regulations. Dispersion modeling of the WCS was conducted using RMP*Comp version 1.03. RMP*Comp was developed for use in performing the OCA required under EPA's Risk Management Planning rule. \n\nTo assist in emergency response planning, this facility has developed ACSs as required by the RMP regulations. ACSs and hazard assessment results are useful for assessing the potential hazards posed by the facility and developing or assessing emergency response plans to respond to such an event. These scenarios are unlikely, but are physically possible. For the ACS analyses, the following assumptions were made: rural terrain surro"

As allowed by the RMP regulations, active mitigation measures were considered and are described under each scenario. This facility conducted dispersion modeling of the ACSs using RMP*Comp. \n\nThe first ACS associated with the release of toxic substances at this facility is a crack in a whip (transfer) line at the 1 -ton chlorine cylinder filling station. This facility believes that this scenario, although unlikely, could occur based on its knowledge of similar accidents that have occurred at other chlorine facilities. A whip line crack would not result in a significant release of chlorine from a tank or vessel, because chlorine detectors continually monitor the area and the railcar unloading station is equipped with automatic shutdown valves. However, a whip line crack could result in a 5-second jet release of liquid chlorine from a process line or a gas cylinder from a height of I meter. Five seconds was the estimated maximum time required for an operator or emergency responder to respond to an alarm from area detectors and close the valve on the whip line. The estimated size of the crack in the line is equivalent to a 1/8-inch diameter hole. The amount of chlorine released from an open, 6- foot long, 1/8-inch diameter opening in the line at 165 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), would be 7.5 pounds, including the volume of chlorine in the line, at a rate of 89.9 pounds per minute.   The potential maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter (mg/l) under these conditions is 0.4 miles ('the vulnerability zone\").\n\nTo illustrate the alternative case release vulnerability zone, the facility has placed a circle on the map with its center at the point of release and a radius of 0.5 miles as required by the January 12, 1999 document entitled \"Region I LEPC California Accidental Release Prevention Program Implementation Guidance "

The five-year accident history allows the Torrance Facility to explain to the community the factors causing or contributing to accidental releases, the on-site and off-site impacts of accidental releases, and the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will ever occur again. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence. \nPersonnel at the Torrance Facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1, 1997 to the present to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or "

Instead, the facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. These activities are coordinated through the Los Angeles City Fire Department. \nThe Torrance facility does though have a detailed Emergency Action Plan to cover minor incidents at the facility. The facility's Contingency Plan Manual covers these activities. \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAS, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation. \nJCI Torrance personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases): \nAccident Investigation Reports  Job Safety Analyses \nStandard Operating Procedures \nNo action items meeting the selection criteria were identified."
