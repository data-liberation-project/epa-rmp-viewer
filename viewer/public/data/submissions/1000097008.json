ACS Personnel are trained per its Emergency Action Plan.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.

Life and fire safety systems were engineered into the plant as part of its design and code requirements. The facility employs a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, built in 2001, according to the latest codes and standards in use at that time. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant.

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes both the EPA Risk Management and OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs. ACS has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs. The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include a Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  Nuances between the RMP & PSM Programs have been integrated according to Guidance documents published by USEPA.\r\n\r\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of ACS to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\r\n\r\nACS has adopted an overall non-responding facility policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local E"

WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment. This includes steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation & setup of portable equipment to start-up and daily operation to disassembly and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  Specific repair tasks or upgrades for expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the WPS Service Call system. Tasks are tracked through this system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, ACS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and reduced release potential.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOver the years it became apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\r\nOther release prevention steps taken at ACS-LLC:\r\n\r\n  -  Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves: Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards. Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves. The \r\n     cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment"
