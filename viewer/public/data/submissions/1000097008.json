The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes both the EPA Risk Management and OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs. ACS has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs. The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include a Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  Nuances between the RMP & PSM Programs have been integrated according to Guidance documents published by USEPA.\n\n\n\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of ACS to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\nACS has adopted an overall \"non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local E"

Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate reports, and periodic site reviews by the Yuma Fire Department. ACS and affiliated Western Precooling Systems (WPS) support the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day, which has also been instrumental in coordination with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nACS & WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen. ACS Personnel are trained per its Emergency Action Plan.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  WPS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  ACS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of ACS.  \n\n\n\nEach company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (ACS employees and contracted production workers are trained for their emergency actions; Refrigerating Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe ACS facility is located in an industrial area of Yuma just east of the Marine Corp Air Station. ACS provides pre-cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables. The facility was put into operation in November of 2001 and is permitted by the City of Yuma.  Life and fire safety systems were engineered into the plant as part of its design and code requirements. The facility employs a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, built in 2001, according to the latest codes and standards in use at that time. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant. Most of the ammonia equipment is located outside (Compressors, Vessels, Condensers, Vacuum Tube Systems, Icemakers, Piping Trams and Associated Valves, Instrumentation, a"

ACS, LLC is owned by WPS-50% and QV Properties, LLC-50%. \n\n\n\nA portion of the ammonia refrigerating equipment is portable and is moved on and off site seasonally as needed for the local produce season, which is common in the industry. Facility piping and connections to portable equipment is permanently installed.  Some of the portable equipment is owned by ACS. Other portables are leased or owned in partnerships with WPS and other companies according to seasonal harvest demand.  The busy season is from late November through mid-April annually.  Heavy maintenance is conducted in the remaining off-season months. In the last 5 years ACS has expanded a cold room adding 3 evaporators of the same type as others and has taken control and ownership of a connected low-side building.  The building has been connected to the ACS Refrigerating Process since its construction in 2004.   \n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a combination of fencing, gates, and retention basins on the perimeter.  A CCTV system is installed to monitor the facility inside and out.\n\n \n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's online RMP/PSM Management solution called WBBM (Web-based Business Manager).\n\n\n\nMonitoring and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment is a coordinated effort. An ACS mechanical Supervisor and crew personnel are responsible for day-to-day monitoring and light operational maintenance.  WPS perfor"

WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment. This includes steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation & setup of portable equipment to start-up and daily operation to disassembly and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  Specific repair tasks or upgrades for expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the WPS Service Call system. Tasks are tracked through this system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, ACS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and reduced release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOver the years it became apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur. Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at all oil drain points.\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at ACS-LLC:\n\n\n\n  -  Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves: Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards. Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves. The \n\n     cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment "
