The Park utilizes approximately 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a closed-loop refrigeration system used to provide cooling for a 1,600 meter bobsled/luge course.  \n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Utah Winter Sports Park is expected commenced operations in the Fall of 1996, and has not had any accidents over the past five years. \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nTheoretical ammonia release scenarios were developed to estimate the impacts to local citizens in the community and spectators during the games.  Ammonia concentrations were estimated using the air dispersion model Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) version 5.2, which uses both Gaussian and heavy gas algorithms.  \n\nOne worst-case and one alternative case release scenario was developed.  The worst-case release assumes that the entire ammonia charge is released into the atmosphere during pessimistic meteorological conditions, and the alternative case assumes the ammonia supply and return lines are completely ruptured.  All scenarios assume the release occurs for 10 minutes, and in the alternative cases, shut-off valves function as active mitigation devices to prevent additional release.  \n\nThe distance to the 0.14 milligram per liter toxic endpoint for ammonia (from the American Industrial Hygiene Association\u0012s Emergency Response Planning Guidelines Level 2) exceeds the distance to the nearest receptor (approximately 0.6 miles) for all release scenarios considered.  The worst-case release is conservatively predicted to reach the toxic endpoint at a distance of 5.0 miles from the facility, and the alternative release at 1.0 miles.\n\nThe population estimated to reside within the worst case release distance is 6,400, and with the alterna"
