IRWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  IRWD staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIRWD has an Emergency Response Plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\n\n - A detailed emergency response action guide\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the IRWD Emergency Response Team\n - Incident Command System (ICS) and unified command interface\n - ICS position descriptions including their responsibilities\n - Vicinity and evacuation maps\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\n     - Evacuation\n     - Fire in a process or non-process area\n     - Injuries\n     - Threats and civil disorder\n     - Wild land or adjacent property fire\n     - External events (e.g., earthquake)\n     - Potential imminent danger to personnel\n     - Chemical spill (e.g., caustic and chlorine)\n     - Chlorine release\n     - Offsite event involving a hazardous material\n\nIRWD maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  A group of IRWD employees are trained and fully equipped to handle hazardous spill containmen"

These employees train monthly and run drills twice a year. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan complies with the emergency response requirements of PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations and it is reviewed periodically to ensure that it contains up-to-date information.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nChlorine is used at Irvine Ranch Water District Rattlesnake Reservoir Disinfection Facility for disinfecting water.  Chlorine containers are stored  in the Chlorine Storage Room.  Chlorine gas is supplied to the chlorinators, which regulate the chlorine feed rate.  The entire system operates under vacuum.  This is an important safety feature that minimizes the possibility of an accidental release.  The vacuum regulators maintain the pressure downstream of the containers under vacuum and are shut off automatically on loss of vacuum. The vacuum is created when water flows through the injectors.  \n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\nWorst Case Release Analysis Summary\nRelease of the maximum quantity of chlorine that can be stored in the largest vessel  is assumed per the requirements of the regulations to be released in 10 minutes inside the Storage Building.  Since all elements of the system are located inside the fully enclosed Chlorination Building, passive mitigation measures were incorporated in the release rate calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used as specified in the regulation.  The RMP*Comp computer program was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 3-ppm.  \n\nAlternative Release Analysis Summary\nA release of chlorine gas while the scrubber has either failed or ineffective is postulated.  This scenario represents the worst probable scenario leading to continuous chl"

Since the entire system is located inside the Chlorination Building, the release rate was adjusted per EPA\u00bfs recommended formulations.  The meteorological conditions specified in the regulation for alternative scenarios were used.  Similar to the worst case, RMP*Comp computer program was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 3-ppm.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIRWD has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine and other regulated substances at all its sites.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are instituted to ensure safe practices are routinely employed at all District facilities and operations.  This includes the safety practices recommended by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the management programs, chlorine gas detectors annunciate locally and on the District\u00bfs computer system.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of chlorine at this facility during the last five years.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of system design, construction and initial startup tests, a Process Hazard Analysis, a Seismic Hazard Analysis and a Pre-Startup Safety Review were conducted where a large number of potential accident scenarios were considered.  All the recommendations that were put forward by the analyses teams were reviewed by District management and were implemented prior to the completion of the system.    These recommendations were specifically focused on improving system safety."
