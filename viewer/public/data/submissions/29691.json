      "SummaryText": "1. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe Kinder Morgan Tampaplex Terminal, formerly IMC Phosphates Port Sutton Terminal, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in prevention, training, emergency equipment, participation in drills and meetings with local emergency response organizations.\n\nManagement emphasizes the importance of complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard so that employees and the surrounding community are adequately protected from potential fire, explosion, or hazardous release.\n\nIt is Kinder Morgan's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and hazardous substances. If a release does occur, personnel are trained to appropriately respond.\n\n2. Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Kinder Morgan Tampaplex Terminal is engaged in the storage and transfer of liquified anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from ocean going vessels at the dock and transferred via an aboveground pipeline at an aboveground, refrigerated storage tank. The liquid ammonia, stored at 27 degrees F, is then transferred via piping through heat exchangers to a commercial underground pipeline for transport to various end-users to produce various crop nutrients. A small amount of anhydrous ammonia is loaded into cargo tank trucks and railcars for shipment offsite to end users.\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance present at the facility that exceeds the threshold planning quantity.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario at the facility is the loss of the entire contents of the refrigerated storage tank over a ten minute period into the secondary containment structure. The 188 foot diameter retaining wall surrounding the refrigerated tank qualifies as passive mitigation and is designed to function without human intervention, mechanical action or energy. The retai"

      "SummaryText": "ning wall is designed to hold 110% of the storage contents. The release rate is estimated based upon the evaporation rate of a liquid pool with a surface area equal to that within the containment area. Computer modeling was used to predict the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l and was determined to have off-site impacts. A computer dispersion model, DEGADIS, was selected for the worst-case scenario because of its ability to calculate dense gas concentrations and predict plume dispersion behavior. This worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur based upon the design of the storage vessel and its placement within the containment structure.\n\n4. General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemcial Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and based upon the quantity present at the terminal, Tampaplex is subject to these requirements and therefore, has satisfied the eligibility requirements for a Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA's RMP. The Terminal has fully implemented OSHA's PSM requirements and is using this program as its RMP Prevention Program. In summary:\n\nThe PSM program is an active on-going process with full participation from employees at all levels from all areas of the terminal. The initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the anhydrous ammonia system was completed in 1994. All action items generated as a result of the revalidation were actively pursued for prompt completion. The system was upgraded to meet applicable codes and standards.\n\nThe Process Safety Review Committee meets once per month to ensure the implementation and continuation of the PSM program. This includes writing and updating operating and maintenance procedures, training, reviewing mechanical integrity, quality assurance, management of change programs, contractor safety, security and developing an audit schedule.\n\nThe terminal has numerous active mitigation activities measures "

These measures, commonly called \"layers of protection\", include construction standards, multiple compressors,a vessel flare, safety relief valves, continuous leak monitoring, manual shutdown procedures, water cannons, and extensive operator training. Non-destructive testing for detecting potential cracks and other forms of corrosion, is conducted on a regular schedule for the storage vessel and piping.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history includes a review of all accidental releases of regulated substances held above threshold quantities that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries or significant property damage or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage. Since June 21, 1994, the Terminal has no releases which meet the above criteria.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Terminal has an emergency response program in place to address foreseeable emergency situations and accidents involving hazardous substances. The Emergency Response Plan establishes a mechanism for providing hazard and emergency preparedness information to employees, external emergency response agencies, and the community. The Program contains procedures for notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency reponse agencies about an accidental release. It is designed to advise personnel how to respond and of responsibilities during these emergencies.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Teminal is working tinmely to resolve all action items generated as a result of internal audits, revalidations and process hazard analysis."
