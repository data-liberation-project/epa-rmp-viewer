The amounts of hydrogen handled by this faclity exceeds the threshold quantities set by the EPA.It is our ploicy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Air products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspection, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, and relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel suppliment the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emrgency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the nitoifcation of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios describe were selected based on the criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nPure liquid hydrogen is stored in 2 (two) 20,000 gallon tanks. Gaseous H2 is also produced onsite using a steam methane reformer.  The H2 product from this process equipment is connected to hydrogen vaporized from the 2 storage tanks. The liquid hydrogen is delivered to the site by tank truck. The liquid hydrogenis vaporized by ambient air vaproizers located adjacent to the tanks.  The gaseous hydrogen is pipe"

Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammible gas that has resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacutations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nThe facilities emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and to initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Cleveland Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n6.  Plannned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nAt this ti"
