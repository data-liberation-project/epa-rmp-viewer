      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nAlto Magic Valley LLC, located at 2600 Washington Ave Burley, Idaho U.S.A., and operates a dry mill ethanol facility to produce ethyl alcohol or fuel ethanol from primarily corn. The facility also produces animal feeds such as wet distillers grain, distillers syrup and distillers corn oil as a byproduct of ethanol production.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nAqueous ammonia (24%) is stored on-site in liquid form and used in the ethanol production process for pH control of the corn and water solution to maintain the effectiveness of enzymes used to break the corn starch down into sugars. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored the facility is 34,200 gallons or 275,000 pounds. The ammonia tank is located in a concrete containment structure. Natural Gasoline (Denaturant) is stored on-site in liquid form and blended at <5% with ethyl alcohol prior to shipping to render the alcohol undrinkable according to ATF regulations.  Denaturant used by the facility can contain pentane and isopentane in varying percentages above 10,000 pounds each, the off-site consequence analysis was conducted using data from a certificate of analysis by a 3rd party laboratory. The maximum amount of denaturant (flammable mixture) on-site is estimated to be approximately 58,750 gallons or 321,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank inside a concrete containment structure. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nAlto Magic Valley, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.
