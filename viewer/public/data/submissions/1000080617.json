EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n[40 CFR 68.155; CalARP Article 3, 2745.3]\n\nThe Risk Management Program at Growers Ice Company is designed to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration process. The following is a summary of the programs, policies, and procedures in place to reduce the risk of a hazardous materials release.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the RMP is threefold: 1.) to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards, 2.) to identify hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia, and 3.) to provide procedures to minimize the risks involved with handling this material.\n\n\n\nGrowers Ice Company has implemented the RMP at the Salinas, CA facility in order to comply with regulations and to fulfill this facility's responsibility to protect its employees, equipment, property, the surrounding community, and the environment from accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the mandated prevention program elements listed in the RMP:\n\n? The Growers Ice Company facility utilizes visual inspection procedures prior to startup and shutdown of on-line cooling equipment. This equipment includes compressors, condensers, and evaporation equipment as well as ice makers, vacuum coolers and air handling equipment\n\n\n\n? General visual inspections are done throughout the day as starting or stopping of the equipment is required\n\n\n\n? Inspections identify potential sources of problems and potential releases of ammonia.\n\nOn-site personnel, registered engineers and refrigeration contractors as required then resolve equipment corrections\n\n\n\n? As described above, Accidental Release Prevention is a continuing ongoing process involving system inspection, emergency response program reviews and employee hazardous response training (performed yearly).

On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an offsite release. \n\n\n\nNo emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel and for releases above an ammonia concentration of 300 ppm.\n\n\n\nLocal fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event.
