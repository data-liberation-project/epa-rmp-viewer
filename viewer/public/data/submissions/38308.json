All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Encino Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agency (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Encino Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Encino Chlorination Station is located at 4500 Encino Avenue, Encino, California. The station serves to chlorinate up to 125 cubic feet per second (CFS) of water in a 72-in pipeline, which carries water to and from Encino reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of the San Fernando Valley with potable water. The station consists of a chlorine storage room and an electrical equipment room.   The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules A maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers are stored at the Encino chlorine building.  Up to three of the four chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the fourth is stored as a spare.

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Encino Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Encino facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Encino Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of proven technology,"

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Encino facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nIn normal operation, chlorine is withdrawn from 1 one-ton chlorine container to supply gaseous chlorine to the chlorinators and up to two additional containers can be connected to the system as backups.  All three containers are also equipped with Halogen actuators on the gas valves and will close the valves when a chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is detected in the room.  All three containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  A fourth ton container sitting on trunions is stored as a spare. \n\nChlorine gas is discharged from the container through a pigtail, which is attached to the gas valve on the ton container.  The chlorine flows under pressure to the chlorine piping header containing two pressure-regulating valves, which supplies pressurized chlorine gas to the chlorinators.\n\nA second (and occasionally a third) ton container is connected to the header system and serves as a backup supply, which automatically takes over when the primary container is empty.  This is accomplished by adjusting the outlet pressure of the regulators to select one as primary (setpoint 30 psig) or secondary (setpoint 20 psig).  The third container is connected to the header and serves as an overall backup to meet summer demand (two to four weeks per year maximum).

The injectors provide vacuum, which draws chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The solution is piped through diffusers into the reservoir outlet pipeline.\n\nA chlorine leak detector with two probes is provided to detect chlorine leaks in the chlorinator room.  The detector activates an alarm system which includes:  (1) a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, (2) an audible alarm within the chlorination building, and (3) an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller unit, which determines the feed rate relative to the water flow rate and the measured chlorine residual after chlorination.  The chlorine piping over the chlorinators contains an automatic actuated ball valve which shuts off the chlorine supply to the chlorinators when the water flow in the 72\" line reverses to flow into the reservoir.  A sensor in the pipeline detects this reverse flow condition.  During this condition, no chlorination is necessary.  There is a differential pressure cell transmitting a flow signal to the controller. \n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlorination facility, an alarm will alert the LAAFP control room.  Chlorine flow will continue unaffected, with no safety consequences.  An emergency generator will automatically start and supply power to the entire system.\n\nThe facility is normally unmanned; water treatment operators visit the facility daily when the station is in operation.

      "SummaryText": "a Risk Management Program, a hazard review was performed in April 1999 for the chlorination system.  The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine handling system.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the DWP.  Additional 14 changes to further improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2004, when the hazard review was completed for the facility.  It is expected that these recommendations will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorination system."
