This commitment is demonstrated by the site's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at this facility.  It is the site's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. However, if a release were to occur, employees are trained in emergency response to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  In addition, the emergency response plan is coordinated with Gales Ferry, CT Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility's primary activities encompass Plastics Manufacturing.  There are 2 regulated substances present at the Allyn's Point facility.  These substances include 1,3-Butadiene, and Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile].  The regulated substances at the facility are involved in several uses.  1,3-Butadiene is used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymer.  Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is used for for manufacturing ABS plastic pellets and latex emulsion polymer.                                    \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Allyn's Point facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
