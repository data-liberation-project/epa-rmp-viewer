This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Hatter's Pond Gas Plant, located in Creola Alabama, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce Condensate, Propane, Butane and Residue gas. The Hatter's Pond Gas Plant has regulated flammables, including:\n7 Iso-butane\n7 Normal Butane\n7 Ethane\n7 Methane\n7 Iso-Pentane\n7 Normal Pentane\n7 Propane\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substance(s) at the Hatter's Pond Plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the largest inventory of propane contained in a single vessel/storage tank. The maximum inventory in this vessel/storage tank is 212,556.48 pounds. The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VEC). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles as determined by EPA-RMP Comp (TM). Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Hatter's Pond Plant is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from a release of a flammable mixture from an Inlet Separa"

Every employee has access to documentation and files included in PSM/RMP. It is the responsibility of every employee at the plant to comply with the aspects of PSM/RMP. The document entitled Employee Participation explains this section of PSM/RMP in greater detail.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\n\nAccording to the PSM/RMP standard, there are three main aspects of Process Safety Information required to properly inform employees/public of the potential hazards of processes involving potentially hazardous chemicals.  They are the following:\n\nPotential hazards of chemicals in process:\n\nInformation concerning the chemicals in the process is included in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  They include information on the toxicity, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and chemical stability of the produced/processed materials and chemicals used in the plant. The potential hazards of different chemicals being mixed are covered under this subsection. Also covered are a worst case scenario and an alternate scenario, which could affect off site receptors.\n\nTechnology of process:\n\nThe technology of the process refers to descriptions of processes at the plant, maximum intended inventories, inventory calculations and safe upper and lower limits on temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and compositions.  Included in this subsection is the plant Process Flow Diagram (PFD).\n\n\nEquipment in process:\n\nRequired information about equipment used in the plant includes: materials of construction, piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's),"
