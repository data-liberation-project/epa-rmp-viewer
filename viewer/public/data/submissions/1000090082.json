      "SummaryText": "Risk is defined as an event that has a probability of occurring and could have either a positive or negative impact to a project should that risk occur. A risk may have one or more causes and, if it occurs, one or more impacts. For example, a cause may be requiring an environmental permit to do work, or having limited personnel assigned to design the project. The risk event is that the permitting agency may take longer than planned to issue a permit, or the assigned personnel available and assigned may not be adequate for the activity. If either of these uncertain events occurs, there may be an impact on the project cost, schedule, or performance. All projects assume some element of risk, and it's through risk management where tools and techniques are applied to monitor and track those events that have the potential to impact the outcome of a project.  \n\n\n\nRisk management is an ongoing process that continues through the life of a project. It includes processes for risk management planning, identification, analysis, monitoring and control. Many of these processes are updated throughout the project lifecycle as new risks can be identified at any time. It's the objective of risk management to decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to the project. On the other hand, any event that could have a positive impact should be exploited.  \n\n\n\nThe identification of risk normally starts before the project is initiated, and the number of risks increase as the project matures through the lifecycle. When a risk is identified, it's first assessed to ascertain the probability of occurring, the degree of impact to the schedule, scope, cost, and quality, and then prioritized. Risk events may impact only one or while others may impact the project in multiple impact categories. The probability of occurrence, number of categories impacted and the degree (high, medium, low) to which they impact the project will be the basis for assigning the risk priority.

      "SummaryText": "sks should be entered into a risk register and documented as a risk statement.  \n\n\n\nAs part of documenting a risk, two other important items need to be addressed. The first is mitigation steps that can be taken to lessen the probability of the event occurring. The second is a contingency plan, or a series of activities that should take place either prior to, or when the event occurs. Mitigation actions frequently have a cost. Sometimes the cost of mitigating the risk can exceed the cost of assuming the risk and incurring the consequences. It is important to evaluate the probability and impact of each risk against the mitigation strategy cost before deciding to implement a contingency plan. Contingency plans implemented prior to the risk occurring are pre-emptive actions intended to reduce the impact or remove the risk in its entirety. Contingency plans implemented after a risk occurs can usually only lessen the impact.    \n\n\n\nIdentifying and documenting events that pose a risk to the outcome of a project is just the first step. It is equally important to monitor all risks on a scheduled basis by a risk management team and reported on in the project status report.  \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan defines how risks associated with the use of Chlorine at Trujillo Bajo Filtration Plan will be identified, analyzed, and managed. It outlines how risk management activities will be performed, recorded, and monitored throughout the lifecycle of the project and provides templates and practices for recording and prioritizing risks.\n\n\n\nThe Autonomous Municipality of Carolina, the Municipal Aqueduct Department and the Trujillo Bajo Filtration Plant is committed to the safety of employees and the public and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

In the event of an accidental release, Trujillo Bajo Filtration Plant will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment. \n\n \n\nTrujillo Bajo Filtration Plant is actively involved with other local industries and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). This group has invested in the First Alert emergency notification system that can be activated day or night during emergencies to automatically call residents and businesses. \n\n\n\nThe Trujillo Bajo Filtration Plant is a 2 MGD water treatment plant. Its source water comes from three 150' long horizontal collectors or caissons located 20' under the bed of the Rio Grande de Loiza. Water treatment consists of pre-chlorination, lime injection, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and post-chlorination. Chlorine is used in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule. A risk management plan was prepared for chlorine as an additional safeguard for that system.  Chlorine is use in railcars.   Chlorine is an integral part of water treatment. Chlorine in cylinders is used to treat and disinfect water.\n\n\n\n"
