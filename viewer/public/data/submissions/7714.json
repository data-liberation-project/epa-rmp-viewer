      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE MAPLE LEAF FARMS INDIANA DIVISION PROCESSING PLANT LOCATED IN MILFORD INDIANA\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response plans for the plant\n\nMaple Leaf Farms, Inc. has developed a Crisis Management Team to prepare for any emergency which may occur at  any of the Maple Leaf Farms facilities.  Maple Leaf Farms Inc. is committed to protect their employees and the people of the surrounding community\n\nAt the present time we have just completed a  process hazard analysis and are  making the required changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to meet PSM requirements for Ammonia refrigeration systems. All the modifications should be complete by  September of this year.  We also have had a Mechanical integrity inspections and all code violations found on this inspection have been corrected  or will be as soon as the engineering firm we have contracted with can complete them.  The Maple Leaf Farms, Inc. Executive Board is committed to making Maple Leaf Farms the safest and best processing plant in Indiana and have given the plant manager the authority to purchase the equipment and training required to maintain a Maple Leaf Farms/Serenade Foods Emergency Response Team.\n\nFacility and regulated substance handled\n\nMaple Leaf Farms Processing Plant is located at 9166 N 200 E. which places the processing plant 700 ft from the intersection of 900 N. & 200 E. The facility consists of a main office building with 2 building complexes behind it and to the north of the main plant. The main processing plant processes approximately 500,000 ducks per month as whole body ducks or as parts for further processing or sale.  The only regulated chemical used by Maple Leaf Farms is anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  There is approximately 16,000 lbs of ammonia within the system.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAt the Maple Leaf Farms Processing Plant in Milford Indiana the worst case scenario would be the rupture of the receiver which is located outsi"

The receiver maximum capacity is 9800 lbs of ammonia if full but for normal operations it is only 40 % full and would be holding approximately 3927 lbs of ammonia. The EPA RMP Comp was used to calculate the range to toxic endpoint. It was determined that the distance to toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles and would effect approximately  125 people.   The prevailing winds are usually from the southwest and could result in an elongated plume originating at Maple Leaf Farms and extending to the other side of Dewart Lake which could require the evacuation of a larger # of people.\n\nAlternative Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe alternative scenario would involve a break in the liquid line leaving the recirculation package. This could only happen if there was a pipe failure or a catastrophic release as a result of a tornado touching down at the plant.  If the valve to the receiver is not shut off you could potentially lose 8,000 pounds of ammonia before the compressor safeties and other safety interlocks would shut down the system due to lack of ammonia.  The EPA RMP COMP was used to determine the distance to toxic endpoint which is 0.8 miles.  The resulting cloud of ammonia would have an endpoint of 0.8 mi. but again if the prevailing winds are out of the SW as is the usual case the plume could extend to the west side of Dewart Lake.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMaple Leaf Farms has in place a Process Safety Management Program. AS a result of the PSM Program the following procedures and policies have been put into place:\n              Employee Participation Guidelines\n              Employee Training\n              Contractor Qualification Guidelines\n              Pre-Startup Procedures\n              Mechanical Integrity Inspection Policy\n              Support Personnel Entry Program\n              Hot Work Permit Program\n              Management of  Change P"

ANY problems are addressed and repaired as needed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nMaple Leaf Farms has not had a release in excess of 100 lbs of ammonia in the last five years. \n\nMaple Leaf Farms Emergency Response Plan\n\nMaple Leaf Farms and Serenade Foods have developed an joint emergency response team to deal with any accidental release of  ammonia into the environment.  The team has been trained and equipment has been ordered to enable the team to set up a  mobile command center which will contain the P & I D drawings for both facilities, communication equipment, decontamination equipment, tools,  level A suits, SCBAS, & all emergency phone numbers. Warsaw HazMat Team is our backup in the event of a catastrophic release or a release at night or on weekends . They have toured our facilities and given us a hazard analysis We will be having drills twice yearly to  familiarize the team with the equipment and  procedures to be followed.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Maple Leaf Farms Processing Plant employees have all completed Ammonia Awareness training and more intense on the job training is being set up for the maintenance and management personnel. That will take place in the next two months.  All the safety relief valves are scheduled to be changed out this summer  as part of our PSM Program.  In the capitol plan Maple Leaf will be placing the water cooled evaporators on the roof of the building in the next two years. There is also a shut off valve (King Valve) for the engine room being installed outside the room. Thus eliminating the danger of"

The Plant Safety Committee is taking an active role in the implementation of the emergency response plan, thus making all employees aware  of the dangers of ammonia.  WE are working closely with an engineering firm which specializes in Process Safety Management and they will be conducting our compliance audits.  We have already set up the policies and will within 6 months have the contractor do an audit. The audit must wait until all currently identified deficiencies have been corrected.  Maple Leaf Farms can only continue to be the number one processor of duck in the world if  the Executive Group continue to support the current Process Safety Management Program which is in place."
