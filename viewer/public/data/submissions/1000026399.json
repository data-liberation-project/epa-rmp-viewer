The facility is located in Dinuba, California, a rural section of Tulare County.  The facility occupies approximately five (5) acres and is boarded on all sides by vineyards and/or fruit tree orchards.  Jody Fresh's business is seasonal, with increased activity during the growing season, generally from mid-April to mid-November.\n\n\n\nJody Fresh's facility includes a refrigeration system which is required to maintain proper stoage temperature.  The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is widely regarded as the most efficient refrigerant on the market.  Anhydrous ammonia is however a toxic material, and is subject to both California State and Federal accident prevention regulations.  These regulations require the development and implementation of a Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nSAFETY POLICY\n\nJody Fresh is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accident release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to Jody Fresh due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) for a facility and an alternate release scenario for each covered chemical.  The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"..the greatest amount held in a single vessel, released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternate release scenario is identified as a release that is more lik"

These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nJody Fresh has not had any significant releases or accidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system since assuming ownership of the system and facility in 2009.  A significant release includes incidents resulting in off-site injuries, environmental impact, or evacuations, or on-site injuries or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nJody Fresh has developed programs to comply with required environmental , health, and safety standards.  Jody Fresh has adopted a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of ammonia through its Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nJody Fresh's Risk Management Program includes programs and procedures addressing the following areas:\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Accident Investigation Program\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Review\n\n?    Hot Work Program\n\n?    Contractor Safety\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\nIn addition to our management programs, the refrigeration system includes controls, alarms, and safety interlocks designed to monitor and automatically shutdown the system under emergency situations.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nJody Fresh has a written emergency action plan in the event an ammonia release, and to address other emergencies.  Jody Fresh has established a relationship with the Tulare County Fire Department, the first responding agency in the event of an emergency.  Fire officials have toured the facility and familiarized themselves with our emergency systems.  Jody Fresh has also arranged for 24-hour service and response from a trained an qualified ammonia refrigeration contractor in the event of a system emergency.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPRO"
