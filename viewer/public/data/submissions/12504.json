      "SummaryText": "Borough of East Stroudsburg - Water Filtration Plant\n\nThe East Stroudsburg Water Filtration Plant uses chlorination to disinfect the treated drinking water flow prior to distribution to the local community.  The chlorination system uses two Dubble cylinder chlorination units (4-150 lb cylinders conected at one time).  At empty cylinder change out there may be as many as 24 150 Lb gas cylinders on site at one time (3600 lbs.).\n\nAs required by the EPA the \"Worst Case Release Scenario\" was modeled as a catastrophic rupture of one 150 lb cylinder.  For the \"Alternative Release Scenario\" a small tank puncture was chosen yealding a release of 150 lbs. of chlorine over a 10-minute period.  The EPA's RMP*Comp computer model was used to estimate the distance travled by the plume to reach the toxic endpoint for chlorine (0.0087mg/l) .  The RMP*Comp program gives a distance of 0.70 miles for the \"Worst Case Release Scenario\" and 0.20 miles for the \"Alternative Release Scenario\".\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has a Emergency Response Plan that has been coordinated (reviewed) by the Monroe County LEPC."
