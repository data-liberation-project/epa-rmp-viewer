As specified in ? 68.155, the owner or operator must provide an executive summary that includes a brief description of the Risk Management Plan. At Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant (DWWTP), chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater and sulfur dioxide is used to remove the residual chlorine or to dechlorinate the treated wastewater to protect the organisms in the river when it is discharged . Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored in 90 ton tank cars. DWWTP has shut down the old chlorination facility since March 31, 2003, as the new chlorination facility is successfully in operation. MIOSHA did the site consultation at DWWTP for the new dechlorination facility on May 22, 2002 and for the new chlorination facility on January 27, 2003. The following elements describe the Risk Management Plan as per ? 68.155, for the new Chlorination and Dechlorination processes at the Detroit Wastewater treatment Plant.\n\n1.    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\n    Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, under which DWWTP is being operated, is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. The  chlorination and dechlorination processes at DWWTP have been designed and constructed per the applicable codes and engineering standards.  Currently, the chlorination and the dechlorination processes are working and meet the good engineering practices. Also, a preventive maintenance program consisting of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance has been implemented. The chemical supplier makes the tank car inspection, cleaning, repair, interior system tests and relief valve tests."

      "SummaryText": " \n\n    At DWWTP, a set of nine (9) detectors is placed throughout the roof of the administration building and at the junction chamber.  Their function is to warn of chlorine gas in the air and to activate the automatic shut off mechanism of the air intake to the various parts of the building affected. The signals from these detectors are transmitted to the Computer Control Room and the Special Laboratory. \n\n    A sulfur dioxide or chlorine leak will be detected by the gas detector system in the new facilities. The sensors are located in the tank car storage building, chemical feed equipment room, and in the basement. The area of the alarm or malfunction will be indicated on the control panels. Alarm information will be sent to annunciator panels in the tank car storage building, Chlorination and Dechlorination facility maintenance room, Chlorination and Dechlorination control room and to the scrubber.\n\n    The caustic soda air wash system chemically neutralizes chlorine as well as sulfur dioxide from a leak inside the building before the gas escapes to the outside atmosphere.\n\n    Flashing red lights are provided at the entrances to the chlorination and dechlorination buildings.  This is to alert the area personnel that there is or was a leak inside the buildings. Chlorine sensor at the junction chamber trigger audible alarms in the senior chemist's office.\n\n    Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant has designated the Detroit Fire Department as the official responder in case of an accidental release. The plant supervisor will also notify the police to be prepared for an evacuation of the neighboring residents if the need occurs. Other agencies to be notified in the event of accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide are City of Detroit Local Emergency Planning Committee     ( LEPC ), Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) Pollution Emergency Alert System, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The National Response Center (NRC) which will notify the appropriat"

Stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\n    Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant provides secondary treatment for flows up to 930 MGD. During wet weather periods, incremental flows above 930 MGD receive primary treatment and disinfection prior to discharge to the Detroit River. At the pump stations, raw wastewater from the Jefferson Interceptor, Oakwood Interceptor and North Interceptor-East Arm receive coarse screening and grit removal and are then pumped to the primary tanks.  Ferric chloride and/or ferrous chloride are added to the raw wastewater for phosphorous removal. The wastewater is pumped from the Intermediate Lift Pump Station to the secondary treatment facilities where treatment is provided by the activated sludge method.  Following final clarification, the wastewater is disinfected by the addition of chlorine, dechlorinated by the addition of sulfur dioxide, and discharged to the Detroit River. Treated wastewater can be discharged to the Rouge River if hydraulically or structurally necessary. The primary solids and secondary activated solids are gravity thickened and dewatered by either centrifuge or belt filter presses.  The main sludge disposal method is by incineration and landfill of the ash.  Excess sludge is lime stabilized and landfilled.\n\nThe primary components of the new chlorination process are six (6) 90-ton rail cars, sixteen (16) evaporators, sixteen (16) chlorinators, sixteen (16) 4\" injectors, two (2) diffusers and the scrubber system.\n\n The primary components of the dechlorination process are six (6) 90-ton rail cars, fourteen (14) evaporators, fourteen (14) sulfonators, fourteen (14) 3\" injectors, two (2) diffusers and the scrubber system.\n\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "r operator of a stationary source with program 3 processes should analyze and report one worst case release scenario, representing all regulated chemicals, that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an end point provided, and one alternate scenario for each regulated toxic chemical.\n\n    The Worst Case Release Scenario at DWWTP involves the release of 90 tons of sulfur dioxide in a gaseous form over 10 minutes when the tank car is outside the building.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second (m/s) wind speed, the downwind distance to the toxic end point of 0.0078 mg/L as obtained from the gas dispersion model ALOHA ( Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres ) was greater than its maximum cut off distance of 6 miles. Therefore, the EPA's model RMP* Comp was used to model this scenario which results in the definite distance of 16 miles.\n    \n        The Alternative Release Scenario for chlorine from the new facility involves the breakage of one of the header pipes, the failure of excess flow valve, and the failure of the scrubber system.  In this event, chlorine is released at its maximum limit of 15,000 lb./hr over duration of 30 minutes, which is the maximum allowed duration for correcting any chlorine release problem.  Under class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the downwind distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L that obtained from the gas dispersion model ALOHA was 2.1 miles.\n\n  The Alternative Release Scenario for sulfur dioxide involves the breakage of one of the header pipes, the failure of excess flow valve, and the failure of scrubber system when the tank cars are stored inside the building.  In this event, sulfur dioxide is released at its maximum limit of 7,000 lb./hr over duration of 60 minutes, which is the maximum allowed duration for correcting any sulfur dioxide release problem.  Under class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 1."

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n    Periodic training is provided for the operations laboratory and maintenance staff personnel assigned to the  chlorination and dechlorination processes. The training consists of reviewing the manuals and actual hands-on field operation of the equipment.  Leak detection and equipment isolation procedures are also included in this training. \n\n    The preventive maintenance program consists of equipment calibration and replacement of components to maintain process performance. Rupture disc replacement is performed annually to prevent premature chlorine releases caused by eroded or fatigued disks.  A total inspection and/or replacement of the process piping are performed at 5-year intervals. The sensors in the new chlorination and dechlorination facilities have microprocessors that contain instructions and store information. They are programmable, self-diagnostic, and will alert the control monitor if calibration or replacement is necessary.  \n\n5.
