The physical address to the Facility is 16725 245th Street, Mason City, IA 50401.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Mason City, IA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Mason City, IA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this as a Voluntary Update as the Mason City, IA Facility is newly acquired from the former owners of Cartersville Elevator, Inc.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 PSM/RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Mason City, IA Facility is a retail and fertilizer blending agricultural chemical facility that operates two (2) covered processes including: Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia); and Covered Process 2: Ammonium Polyphosphate Blending.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck ("

The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary storage tank.  From the stationary storage tank, the Facility transfers anhydrous ammonia to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Blender where the anhydrous ammonia is blended with water and phosphoric acid.  All transfer and blending operations are performed in accordance with the covered process-specific operating procedure as provided in the PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA single worst case offsite consequence analyses (OCA) representing the two (2) covered processes was completed for this Facility.  This worst case scenario release assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For anhydrous ammonia, the largest vessel is the 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia was modeled as a dense gas ground level horizontal jet release.    \r\n\r\nA single alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios was completed for each Covered Processes.  The release from Covered Process 1 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 2 transfer hose used to load into the stationary storage tank from a commercial tanker truck.  The release from Covered Process 2 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 2 process piping used to transfer anhydrous ammonia from the stationary storage tank to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Blender.  \r\n\r\nAlthough these events are classified as an alternative scenarios, accidents of this type minimized due to the safety valves (i.e. backflow check valve, emergency shutoff valve and excess flow valves at the storage tank load in; excess flow valve and emergency shutoff valve between the storage tank and blender), and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Bran"
