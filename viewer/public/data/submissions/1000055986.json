The PSM/RMPr describes the Accident Prevention Program that includes Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Emergency Response.  Covered process equipment includes one (1) 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank and ancillary piping and valves.  Helena personnel manages the content of the stationary storage tank in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the PSM/RMPr.  \n\n\n\nHelena receives anhydrous ammonia by a Vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the stationary storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "The Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Mason City, IA  Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are applicable to the two covered processes operated at this Facility.  OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 are also applicable and are included in the Combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program (PSM/RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Mason City, IA Facility located about 0.5 miles south of Mason City, IA.  The physical address to the Facility is 16725 245th Street, Mason City, IA 50401.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Mason City, IA Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Mason City, IA Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a Voluntary Update as the Mason City, IA Facility is newly acquired from the former owners of Cartersville Elevator, Inc.  All relevant sections for a Program 3 PSM/RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Mason City, IA Facility is a retail and fertilizer blending agricultural chemical facility that operates two (2) covered processes including: Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Anhydrous Ammonia); and Covered Process 2: Ammonium Polyphosphate Blending.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck ("

The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary storage tank.  From the stationary storage tank, the Facility transfers anhydrous ammonia to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Blender where the anhydrous ammonia is blended with water and phosphoric acid.  All transfer and blending operations are performed in accordance with the covered process-specific operating procedure as provided in the PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nA single worst case offsite consequence analyses (OCA) representing the two (2) covered processes was completed for this Facility.  This worst case scenario release assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For anhydrous ammonia, the largest vessel is the 18,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia was modeled as a dense gas ground level horizontal jet release.    \n\n\n\nA single alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios was completed for each Covered Processes.  The release from Covered Process 1 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 2\" transfer hose used to load into the stationary storage tank from a commercial tanker truck.  The release from Covered Process 2 assumes to take the form of a failure of the 2\" process piping used to transfer anhydrous ammonia from the stationary storage tank to the Ammonium Polyphosphate Blender.  \n\n\n\nAlthough these events are classified as an alternative scenarios, accidents of this type minimized due to the safety valves (i.e. backflow check valve, emergency shutoff valve and excess flow valves at the storage tank load in; excess flow valve and emergency shutoff valve between the storage tank and blender), and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Bran"

      "SummaryText": "ch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Mason City, IA Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Mason City, IA  Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Mason City, IA Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Mason City, IA Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Iowa Homeland Security & Emergency Management of Cerro Gordo County, and the Mason City Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Mason City, IA Facility.\n\n"
