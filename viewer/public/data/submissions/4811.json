Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  We also installed an emergency siren located on the eastern edge of the plant boundary to quickly notify our closest neighbors in the event of an accidental release. \n\nWe have a trained emergency response team on site, and if necessary we coordinate with Williamsport Area Fire Department for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has incident command, fire, and HAZMAT training and drills with the Lycoming County LEPC.\n\n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nalgroup lonza subscribes to the Chemical Manufacturers' Association Responsible Care initiative, which provides for continuous improvements in all aspects of our safety, health and environmental programs.  In addition, the plant safety program includes safety observations and safety alerts as well as celebrations of safety milestone achievements."

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n3.1\tWorst-case Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nChlorine\nThe worst case scenario that was selected is having a railcar, containing 180,000 pounds of chlorine, rupture and lose all its contents within a ten minute period of time to the atmosphere.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 25 miles and potential public and environmental receptors include residences, businesses, national parks, schools, hospitals, and prisons.\n\nEthylenediamine\nThe worst case scenario is the rupture of the ethylenediamine tank, which has a maximum capacity of 228,000 pounds.  The release happens instantaneously and is contained within a concrete dike.   Under worse-case weather conditions, the substance could travel 0.05 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the affected area. \n\n3.2\tAlternative-case Release Scenarios - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThere are three alternative release scenarios that were selected for this facility.\n\nChlorine\nThe alternative case scenario selected is the shearing off of the 1-inch unloading line from the chlorine railcar resulting in a release of 280 pounds of chlorine in a ten minute time period.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.44 miles with area residences and businesses in the affected zone.\n\nFormaldehyde\nThe alternative case scenario selected is a 1-inch diameter rupture in the 2-inch transfer line from the formaldehyde storage tank, resulting in a release of 175 pounds of formaldehyde in a thirty minute time period.
