These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe Spartanburg Facility is an ice cream processing, freezing, and storage\nfacility as well as a fluid milk processing and storage facility.  The facility\nuses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system\nto maintain temperatures in milk tanks, coolers, chillers, and freezers. The \nrefrigeration system is al"

      "SummaryText": "so used to freeze ice cream.\nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process subject \nto the Risk Management Legislation. \n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 7925 lbs. \nof ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of \nthe vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a \nten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 1.6 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst- case weather \nconditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a \nbuilding that would withstand and help to contain such a \nrelease; industry standards for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed \nammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and \nthe auto-dialing system in place to warn operating \npersonnel of process upsets; and the emergency response \nplan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFailure of = purge line would result in a release of 720 \nlbs. of ammonia over a time period of sixty minutes. Under \ncommon weather conditions, ammonia could travel .1 miles \nbefore dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the \npublic. Transfer hose failure was chosen as the alternative \nrelease scenario because it is a temporary connection and \nconstructed of materials other than steel. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: emergency equipment \nsuch as an excess flow valve on the tank truck and valves \nto isolate the transfer hose; the facility accident \nprevention program in place at the facility including \noperating procedures to have personnel present"

We \nhave trained employees for emergency response and maintain \na written emergency response plan.\n\nThis plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning \nCommittee (LEPC) and the local fire department.

The facility is equipped with a siren \nto warn plant personnel of an emergency. The last training at \nthe plant was on January 30, 1999."
