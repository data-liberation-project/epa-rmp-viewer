At this facility, we store and handle propane. The management has adopted and implemented policies and procedures that adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. The most current editions of NFPA 58 and 54 are followed for the safe handling of propane and the installation and maintenance of storage equipment. Safety is the number one consideration in the handling of propane, the design and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel. The Certified Employee Training program (CETP) modules relating to the maintenance procedures of bulk storage containers and equipment and the modules relating to Railcar product transfers is the guide for safety practices and procedures at this terminal.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response plan is based upon the Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures and How to Control L-P Gas Leaks and Fires. Terminal staff will not respond to accidental releases of flammable substances at our facility, but has coordinated response actions with the local fire department. Our response plan includes procedures to call the local emergency responders such as the fire and law enforcement departments as well as any potentially affected neighbors.  \r\n \r\nStationary source and regulated substance handled:\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this terminal is propane.  The purpose of this facility is to store propane for distribution to wholesale customers. Most of the propane is received by rail car and stored in 15 large storage tanks. Up to 16 rail cars may also be stored on site at any give time. In rare cases, it is received by truck transports. This facility is equipped to unload rail cars and truck transports. It is set up to load transports and bobtails; however the maj"
