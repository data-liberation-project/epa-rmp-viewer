Box 248\n\nStapleton, NE  69163\n\n\n\nFacility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stores on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 493130 for establishments engaged in providing A?agricultural inputs, that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. We include all crop protection and petroleum products in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be include in this report. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the spring months.  Anhydrous ammonia may also be applied in the fall during some years.  During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.  The Logan County LEPC and the local response agencies have been informed of the maximum quantities that may be on site at any given time. \n\n\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Our facilities have adequate light and are inspected at various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest anhydrous ammonia tank.

      "SummaryText": "imum quantity released is based on 85% of the capacity of the largest vessel on site as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles is based on the EPA's RMP-Comp Program (version 1.06).  Possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in planning for emergencies. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\n\n\nThere has not been an actual release of anhydrous ammonia during the last 5 years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flow valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) was calculated per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nOur anhydrous ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of anhydrous ammonia and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves at rises; barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles; and lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on anhydrous ammonia.  We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for all areas of our company including the anhydrous ammonia facility included in this pla"

Local Fire Department attempted to control the release and after evacuating and local law enforcement had detoured traffic the fire department and haz mat team were able to control the release and get it stopped.  Following this incident, employees have been retrained on maintenance procedures and how to handle emergencies and emergency response. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThis facility is included in the written Community Emergency Response Plan as prepared by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency (NEMA Formerly Nebraska State Civil Defense Agency).  We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29cfe 1910.38.  We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know Information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to insure they conform to the community plan"
