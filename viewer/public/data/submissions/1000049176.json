Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\n\n\nThe top priority of Greencore USA, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort, Greencore USA, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency and depending on the type and magnitude of the emergency, Greencore USA, Inc. will evacuate or shelter in place its employees and call the North Kingstown Fire Department to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nGreencore USA, Inc. is a convenience foods manufacturing facility located in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.  The process includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \n\n\n"
