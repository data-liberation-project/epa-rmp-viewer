This commitment is\ndemonstrated by significant investments of resources to prevent releases of hazardous substances and for\naccident prevention, such as employee participation and training, and considering safety in the design,\ninstallation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  Valvoline policy is to implement practical controls to\nprevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  However, if a releases does occur, the Hernando\nPlant has a well-defined emergency action plan and trained personnel to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil Plant, located in Hernando, Mississippi, produces a variety of car-care products.  The\nfacility consists of an outdoor tank farm and administrative and manufacturing buildings where the finished\nproducts are processed and packaged (Please see bitmap Valvplant.bmp).  These products are well known\nunder the Pyroil brand name and the manufacturing facility is ISO 9002 certified.  The plant has an excellent\nsafety and environmental record, with a high level of employee involvement and commitment to operational\nexcellence.  \n\nThe Pyroil plant has one manufacturing process (starting fluid manufacturing process) that uses a flammable\nsubstance - ethyl ether - listed in the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  There are no toxic or\nreactive regulated substances involved at the site.  The starting fluid manufacturing process involving ethyl\nether consists of storage, blending and packaging.  The process operations are covered by OSHA's process\nsafety management (PSM) standard and are considered Program"

The warehouse is also included in this RMP as a separate process\nbecause the total quantity in small product containers (7.8 and 11 avdp oz. cans) may exceed the threshold\nquantity sometime during peak storage season.  The warehouse is considered eligible for Program Level 1\nfor the RMP rule because:\n\n     1.   There are no public receptors within a distance to an endpoint from a worst-case scenario;\n     2.   The warehouse has had no release of a regulated substance in the past five years resulting\n          in offsite exposure or consequences; and\n     3.   The warehouse emergency response activities are coordinated with the local responders. \n\n\nPROCESS 1.  STARTING FLUID MANUFACTURING PROCESS\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place for the starting fluid\nmanufacturing process at the Hernando, MS plant.  Because the plant process regulated by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation is also subject to\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard,\nthis summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place\nto implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Pyroil plant conducts its business using a teamwork approach.  A number of business and operational\nteams provide an active forum for employee participation in the implementation of PSM standard elements. \nExamples of employee involvement range from participation in the initial process hazard analysis in 1993 \nto recent development of operating procedures.  Employees have access to all information created as a part\nof the prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be inv"

In addition,\nspecific employee participation activities include operations teams, plant staff, and business team meetings,\nand periodic safety meetings to discuss specific safety-related topics.  Meeting attendance sheets are\nmaintained as primary documentation. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Pyroil plant develops and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperations of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits\nfor key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration\ninformation.   A table summarizing the reference documents and their locations is readily available along with\nspecific procedures for maintaining current and accurate process safety information in the PSM Manual.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response exposure treatment\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the\ninadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Pyroil plant has established safety-related limits for specific process\nparameters (e.g., level, composition) in process documentation. The Pyroil plant ensures that the process\nis maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly-trained personnel,\nand protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown).\n\nThe Pyroil plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and\nconstruction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil plant primarily uses a combination of What-If, checklist and hazard and operability\n(HAZOP) analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of\npeople who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team\nidentifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accidental release prevention and mitigation\nmeasures, and the team makes suggestions for additional safeguards when the team believes such\nmeasures are needed.\n\nThe PHA team findings are evaluated by local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.\nThis ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk ranking receive prompt\nattention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are\ncompleted. The formal resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from\nthe original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency\nuntil the process is no longer operating.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that\nthe operator understood the training.  For specific safety (e.g., fork truck operation) and/or regulatory (hazard\ncommunications) issues, Valvoline has developed a customized computer-based training (CBT) program that\nprovides interactive training for all employees on a routine basis.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Pyroil plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or\nconstruction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Pyroil plant has\nprocedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the\nappropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they\nshould do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Pyroil\nplant personnel of any hazards found during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with\na thorough site orientation that includes (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health\nhazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices, prior to their beginning\nwork. In addition, the Valvoline Pyroil plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during\nthe selection of a contractor. Pyroil plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure\nthat contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Pyroil plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the\nprocess safety information.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a\nbasis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually\ncertified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as\nnecessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, the Pyroil plant has established documentation requirements for logging key process parameters. \nThis documentation also provides guidance on how to respond to a deviation from upper or lower limits for\nspecific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is\nreadily available to operators in the process area and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely\nperform their tasks.\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Pyroil plant has implemented a\ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in process operations. New employees receive\nbasic training in Pyroil plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After\nsuccessfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific\nduties and tasks.

There has not been any reportable release or accidents involving ethyl ether at the Pyroil plant over\nthe past 5 years. Every incident (including any near-miss) is thoroughly investigated to determine ways to\nprevent similar incidents from recurring and this is applied to all relevant processes and operations.\n\n\nPROCESS 2.  PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTER (WAREHOUSE)\n\nValvoline has provided many safeguards to prevent and/or mitigate consequences of accidental releases: \n\n         automatic fire water sprinkler system\n         segregation of products containing ethyl ether to isolate highly-flammable materials\n         control of ignition sources (e.g., only EE-rated fork trucks are allowed)\n         personnel training, including fork truck driver certification program,\n         special fire detectors and alarms for life safety.\n\nThe WCS does not take credit for any of these safeguards. (Please see file VALP2WC1.jpg)\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Valvoline Pyroil plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker\nand public safety as well as the environment and meets the requirements of OSHA's standard found in 29\nCFR 1910.38(a). The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance,\nincluding the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The\nprocedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for\nexposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local\nemergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and postincident cleanup and\ndecontamination "

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection,\nand testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency\nresponse equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific\nemergency response duties. The emergency action program is updated when necessary based on\nmodifications made to Pyroil plant processes or other Valvoline facilities. The emergency action program\nchanges are administered through the change management system, which includes informing and/or training\naffected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Valvoline Pyroil plant is coordinated with the Desoto\nCounty Emergency Management. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the local emergency\nplanning commission (LEPC), with local fire / emergency response officials, local government officials, and\nindustry representatives. The Valvoline Pyroil plant has around-the-clock communications capability with\nappropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a\nmeans of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\nIn addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Valvoline Pyroil plant conducts periodic emergency drills that\ninvolve the emergency response organizations, and the Pyroil plant provides annual refresher training to\nlocal emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the Pyroil plant.\n\n\n\n\n"
