(National Beef) owns and operates a meat cutting and tray packaging facility in Moultrie, Georgia.  On site, National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Moultrie facility which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by National Beef.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process.\n\n\n\nNational Beef is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this program, National Beef is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nNational Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Moultrie facility:\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) & Production"

Moultrie, GA plant located at 189 West Bypass is a meat cutting and tray pack plant.  Fresh meat in large cuts is cut into consumer portions and packaged in consumer trays.  No slaughtering takes place at the plant and no live animals are received.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nNational Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.5 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nNational Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, National Beef will react with the proper actions as listed in the Emergency Response Plan in association with the local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nNational Beef makes s"
