      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.   Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\r\n\r\nThe management and employees of Gold Star FS Inc. are committed to the \r\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release \r\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Morrison Fire Department, \r\nWhiteside County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any \r\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \r\n\r\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 14381 Yager Road  Morrison,IL.61270, is the storage \r\nand blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, \r\nand distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \r\nhandling system consists of one 18,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, \r\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized \r\nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 150,000\r\npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse \r\ntanks.\r\n\r\n3. The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \r\nstate codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety \r\nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by \r\nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the \r\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \r\n1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Compliance with these \r\nregulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention \r\nprogram.  \r\n\r\n4. Five year accident history."
