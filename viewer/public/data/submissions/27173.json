      "SummaryText": "Heyco Metals, Inc. (Heyco) located at 1069 Stinson Drive in Reading, Pennsylvania operates a rolling and slitting process for copper and brass coils that are annealed in furnaces at the facility.  The facility is located in Bern Township, Berks County, PA.  Facility boundaries include other industrial facilities to the southwest, open hilly areas to the northwest and northeast, and open land to the southeast.\n\nThe facility receives anhydrous ammonia by tank truck and stores it in an 8,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tank at Heyco is filled to 85% of capacity.  At this level the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the tank is 35,200 pounds (6,800 gallons).  The anhydrous ammonia is catalytically converted to its basic components, nitrogen and hydrogen.  This dissociated ammonia is used to control the atmosphere in the annealing furnaces.  Anhydrous ammonia is regulated under the Risk Management Program Rule with a 10,000-pound threshold.\n\nThe process with respect to RMP regulations begins with the unloading of anhydrous ammonia into the storage tank and continues to the outlet of the dissociators at which point the ammonia has been converted to hydrogen and nitrogen.\n\nHeyco maintains a detailed emergency action plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38 and EPCRA Emergency Planning requirements for ammonia.  The Facilities Manager serves as facility coordinator for implementation of the emergency action plan. For ammonia releases inside the facility, employees are trained to evacuate and 911 is called for emergency help.  The plan is coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic gas is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel over a 10-minute period.  At Heyco the worst-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the 8,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank.  The information in the ?Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance? was used to calculate the estimated rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease rate and distance to toxic endpoint for this release scenario. The release rate calculated represents the maximum rate of evaporation to the atmosphere.  The release rate was determined to be 3520 lb/min.  The distance to the endpoint was determined using Reference Table 9 in this guidance document to be approximately 2.2 miles.  This may affect neighboring industrial, commercial, and residential areas, as well as, the Reading Municipal Airport, Berks County Career & Technology Center West, River?s Chase Child Care, Toddler Transition Center, Berks County Youth Recreation Center, Berks County Prison, Willow Valley Golf Course, Berks County Heritage Park, and the Schuylkill River.  The estimated residential population that would be affected is 6,252 people.\n\nThe alternate case release scenario is based on an actual incident at the facility.  During this incident residual ammonia was passed through a dissociator to the furnaces due to a leak in a dissociator preheater.  Ammonia odor was detected in the building, personnel were evacuated and the fire department and HAZMAT team were summoned.  This type of incident involving the release of residual ammonia at a dissociator is the most likely alternate release scenario at the facility.\n\nAt the normal rate of operation of a dissociator, ammonia is fed at a rate of 1700 SCFH.  This rate of operation, equates to a mass flow rate or release rate of 1.34 lb/min.  Using Reference Table 23 in the ?Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance?, the distance to the endpoint was determined in this guidance document to be less than 0.1 miles.  This type of incident would most likely have no off-site impacts.\n\nHeyco has taken precautions to ensure that the potential for an incident involving ammonia is minimal.  The RMP program includes the following additional sections that are in practice at the facility.\n\n\n?Management System\n?Employee Participation\n?Process Safety Information\n?Process Hazard Analysis\n?Operating Procedures\n?Trainin"
