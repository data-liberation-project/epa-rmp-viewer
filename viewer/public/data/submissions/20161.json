      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFor further information contact: Bob McKernan, General Manager\n(419) 289-9129\n\n1. The Facility Policy\nThe owners, management, and employees of Hess & Clark are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of formaldehyde. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of disinfectants and animal health products. A water-based mixture of formaldehyde is received and stored in 55-gallon drums and is an ingredient in a disinfectant used in animal care.  The maximum quantity stored would be 54,720 pounds in 114 - 55 gallon drums.  All of the formaldehyde solution is stored and used inside of a building.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario \nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of one 55-gallon drum of formaldehyde solution.  The liquid would be contained inside the building.  The quantity of formaldehyde released would be 186.6 pounds and would evaporate over 8113 minutes.  The formaldehyde would be released into the air at a rate of 0.023 pounds per minute and would be released to the outside atmosphere at a rate of 0.0023 pounds per minute.  According to the computer program, RMP Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint, which is 0.012 mg/l, is 0.1 mile.  However, this is the smallest distance reportable by RMP Comp and the same value (0.1 mile) is given when the quantity released is 20,000 pounds.  This implies that the actual distance to the toxic endpoint is significantly less and is probably less that 0.01 mile or 53 feet.  Hess & Clark feels confident that there are no off-site receptors within this distance and the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than the distance to the property line.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nT"

      "SummaryText": "he facility has a stringent accident prevention program with employee training, standard operating procedures, periodic auditing, and a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan which has been communicated and received by the Ashland Fire Department and Ashland Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\nThe facility has:\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n- a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific formaldehyde safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
