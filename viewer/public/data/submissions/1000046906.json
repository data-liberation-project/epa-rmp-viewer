The facility began operations in 2011.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and Emergency Response Policies - Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion) Charleroi is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, employees control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Washington County emergency response (911) will be utilized for emergency response capability.  Dominion has also contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an oil spill response organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Furthermore, Dominion utilizes a SharePoint website that contains all of the OSHA Process Safety Management program elements associated for all hazard assessment, accident prevention, and emergency response for each facility.\n\n  \n\nTwo loaders typically staff the facility during one shift each day (M-F).  The Dominion Hastings Extraction Plant remotely monitors the operation of the Charleroi Propane Loading terminal while it is un-manned.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled - Dominion owns and operates the Charleroi Propane loading terminal located in Washington County, Pennsylvania.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - The facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Dominion maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) (formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheets or MSDSs) to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products.  As of June 1, 2015, the HCS will require new SDSs to be in a uniform format.\n\n  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The What If method was used to perform these evaluations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engi"

All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Dominion maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial employee training is provided and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Employee training is documented and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.
