      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Dominion Transmission, Inc. - Charleroi Propane Terminal\n\n\n\nThe Charleroi Propane Terminal facility is located off Exit 35 of Interstate 70 in Fallowfield Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe terminal receives propane and loads propane into tankers utilizing two truck docks.  The facility began operations in 2011.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) and Emergency Response Policies - Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion) Charleroi is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, employees control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Washington County emergency response (911) will be utilized for emergency response capability.  Dominion has also contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an oil spill response organization to provide additional emergency response expertise.  Furthermore, Dominion utilizes a SharePoint website that contains all of the OSHA Process Safety Management program elements associated for all hazard assessment, accident prevention, and emergency response for each facility.\n\n  \n\nTwo loaders typically staff the facility during one shift each day (M-F).  The Dominion Hastings Extraction Plant remotely monitors the operation of the Charleroi Propane Loading terminal while it is un-manned.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled - Dominion owns and operates the Charleroi Propane loading terminal located in Washington County, Pennsylvania.

This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Dominion maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) (formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheets or MSDSs) to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products.  As of June 1, 2015, the HCS will require new SDSs to be in a uniform format.\n\n  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The What If method was used to perform these evaluations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engi"
