The facility is located on Highway 225 in Deer Park, Texas.  SCDPP sells base chemicals to other chemical companies that transform them into thousands of consumer products ranging from plastics to building materials.  About 750 full-time employees work at the site.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSCDPP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for our workers, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations. This is mentioned in the site HSE management System Commitment and Policy Statement.  As part of this commitment, SCDPP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the site.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Shell Chemical Deer Park Plant.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the SCDPP consists of the following three elements:\n \n?  A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and to (b) provide information to the public regarding accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP ru"

In fact, SCDPP has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nSCDPP policy on the use of hazardous substances:                                                                                         Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance needs to be used, plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nSCDPP strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  SCDPP also uses the Shell Corporate Engineering Guides and Standa"

In addition, the facility requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.    The facility mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nSCDPP?S goal is to minimize impacts from accidental release should they occur.  In the event of an accidental release, plant operators and emergency responders work together closely to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the impact to the public and the environment.  The facility maintains an active Emergency Response Team that is on call at all times to respond to accidental releases of any hazardous chemical handled at SCDPP.  In addition, SCDPP has a leadership role in Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).  This is a state chartered non-profit mutual-aid cooperative that combines the fire fighting, rescue, hazardous material handling and emergency medical capabilities to its members in the Houston Ship Channel area. Along with the CIMA organization, the plant takes an active role in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Deer Park.  The facility promotes the use of the CAER Phone Hotline number to inform citizens of any unusual plant event and actively works with the Deer Park Citizen?s Advisory Council.\n\nA SCDPP Emergency Response Plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations, as well as Shell?s corporate guidelines.

For this scenario, the gasket failure causes the leak of 1,3-pentadiene which flashes/pools, and is ignited, resulting in a pool fire.  The endpoint of 5 Kw/m2 for 40 seconds which can cause 2nd degree burns was used.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (? 68.155(d))\n\nUnder the EPA RMP criteria for establishing a prevention program, a Program 3 prevention program is required for all SCDPP covered processes.  A Program 3 prevention program is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment beyond the plant's boundaries.
