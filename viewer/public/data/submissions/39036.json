      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Jackson is dedicated to the proper use of chemicals in a manner which is safer to the environment and people.  Chemical storage areas and process equipment are regularly inspected, repaired and upgrade to prevent accidential releases.  Should an accidential release occur, response activities will be coordinated through  the Hinds County Emergency Operations Center and the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.  On-site plant personnel are trained to make repairs to contain small accidential releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant withdraws water from the Pearl River, treats the water and supplies the water to approximately one half of the City of Jackson.  The plant uses chlorine gas mixed in water with anhydrous ammonia gas to disinfect the water.  The chlorine gas is stored in 24 one-ton cylinders.  At a given time, 12 of the cylinders are connected on a single header.  The ammonia gas is stored in a 10,000 gallon aboveground tank with a 2,000 gallon aboveground tank used for backup.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nEPA mandates that the Worst Case Release Scenario have a release of the entire contents of a largest single container of each regulated substances during a 10-minute period with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and F atmospheric stability class.  Distances for releases were developed using tables listed in EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\"  For a 1-ton release of chlorine gas, the distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" is 1.3 miles, affecting approximately 5,300 residents and nearby schools, hospitals, major commercial areas, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Leflore's Bluff State Park.  The 10,000 gallon ammonia tank is limited to being filled to 85% of capacity due to policy of the ammonia suppliers used by the City, reducing effective capacity to 8,500 gallons.  For an 8,5"

Gas was assumed to be released through a 1\" diameter break in the supply piping.  The release scenario for chlorine storage assumed the release of all 12 one-ton cylinders, producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.2 miles, affecting approximately 61 residents, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Leflore's Bluff State Park.  The release scenario for ammonia storage assumed the release to the contents of the largest of the storage tanks (effecetively 8,500 gallons), producing a distance to the \"Toxic Endpoint\" of 0.3 miles, affecting approximately 300 residents, the recreational area along the Pearl River and Leflore's  Bluff State Park.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours each day including holidays with at least two operators.  These operators inspect the chlorine and ammonia systems at least twice each shift.  The chlorine system has area gas monitors which trigger flashing lights and an audible alarm on the main plant computer in the Operations Room.  The chlorine system also has low vacuum alarms which sound on the main plant computer.  The ammonia system has high and low pressure alarms which produce an audible alarm on the plant computer and a warning light on the plant's control board.  Maintenance personnel are immediately called in to stop small releases.  The operation and maintenance of the chlorine and ammonia equipment are performed in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.  Operations and maintenance personnel receive regular train"

Fewell Water Treatment  Plant has developed an emergency response program.  Once it is determine that a situation is larger than what can be handled by Plant personnel, the situation will be reported to the 911 emergency dispatcher, who will then contact the appropriate emergency response agency, such as the City Fire Department, City Police Department and Hinds County Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  Through discussions in monthly Safety Meetings, through formal training conducted by the Mississippi Water and Pollution Control Operators' Association and others and through quarterly emergency drills, plant operations and maintenance personnel will be properly trained in limited emergency response.  As the situation warrants, the public will be notified through the respective Public Affairs personnel at the Police, Fire and Public Works Departments and the EOC.  In the event telephone contact is not possible, emergency dispatch will be conducted using the City-wide radio system.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPersonnel training, equipment inspections and preventative maintenance will continue and be improved."
