      "SummaryText": "Background\n\nThe Tri-Seal Facility located in Winston-Salem, NC produces extruded polystyrene foam products using pentane as the expanding agent. The facility consists of manufacturing areas, storage warehouses, and offices, with a pentane storage tank located outside of the building. The facility operates as much as 24-hours per day, 365 days per year and employs approximately 177 people. Our foam products are used closure liners for various products.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nPentane is the only material at the facility subject to the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) program. Pentane is received by Tri-Seal as a liquid in tank trucks and is unloaded into a storage tank located outside. The maximum pentane storage quantity is 85% of the tank design capacity to allow room for emergency expansion under emergency situations. Pentane is pumped through a controlled system into the foam production building. \n\nA number of valves, controllers, and instruments control and monitor the pressure and flow of the pentane throughout the process. The process reviewed in this PHA encompassed the unloading, storage and delivery of pentane and pentane through a metering system associated with a new extrusion process at the Winston Salem facility. Pentane and Pentane will be used as the blowing agent for foam production. TekniPlex plans to start the process using pentane and then convert to pentane. The pentane or pentane will be off-loaded from tanker trucks and stored in a 12,000-gallon horizontal tank. From the tank, the pentane or pentane will be pumped, via a transfer pump, to a metering system, which will control the pressure and flow of pentane or pentane to the extruder.  The storage tank and transfer pump will be provided by Praxair and leased by TekniPlex. The primary hazards associated with the pentane system are releases that could occur outside or inside the extrusion building that could lead to a fire or explosion. The po"

      "SummaryText": "ssible causes of releases include pump failure, failure of piping or tubing, failure of valves or instruments, storage tank leakage, or failure of equipment used for tank filling.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAs this is the startup of the equipment, the facility has not experienced any significant accidents associated with handling pentane in the last five years. A significant accident would be one causing some type of off-site impact or on-site injuries or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nTri-Seal's Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the facility operates in a safe and reliable manner. This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the RMP. To ensure that the risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, the Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP Coordinator to a staff member with the necessary background, training, and experience. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of the RMP.\n\n\n\nTri-Seal has invested significant manpower and resources to prepare and implement this\n\nRMP and the related Process Safety Management (PSM) program to address the potential hazards associated with pentane at the Winston-Salem facility. The facility's RMP/PSM program contains a Prevention Program that focuses on prevention of releases. The Prevention Program includes the use of appropriate equipment design standards, safety valves and instruments, written operating procedures, employee and contractor training, regular equipment inspection and maintenance, and periodic program auditing to reduce the likelihood of pentane releases occurring. The facility has compiled process safety information and has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) review of the pentane system. The purpose of the PHA was to comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 PSM regulations for the storage of pentane, in "

Analyses of Human Factors and Facility Siting were also completed using checklists and are included in this report.  \n\n\n\nThe pentane storage tank was designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code for pressure vessels. The pentane system was designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable portions of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) 58 LP-Gas Code and is equipped with a variety of modern safety equipment.\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented administrative controls and procedures to aid in the prevention of releases from the operation of the pentane system. Personnel operating and maintaining the pentane system undergo regular training. The training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.\n\nWritten operating procedures are used to standardize the procedures for startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. Tank loading is conducted by contract truck drivers certified to safely handle LP-gases and monitored by trained Tri-Seal personnel. The facility conducts regular planned inspection and preventative maintenance of the pentane system equipment.\n\n\n\nAdditional Steps to Improve Safety\n\nTri-Seal has created a culture for continuous improvement of its safety systems and programs. We have trained our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. We also encourage our employees to suggest changes or improvements that will help to increase the safety of the facility. We perform inspections and preventative maintenance to minimize the potential for unanticipated of our equipment. Our systems and programs will be audited, typically by an outside company, at least every three years to evaluate their effectiveness.\n\n"
