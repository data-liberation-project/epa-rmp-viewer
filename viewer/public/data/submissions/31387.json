The City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department recognized the KIK So Cal facility as a Stationary Source under the Federal regulations and requested this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  KIK So Cal's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon proper construction design and safety features of the facility, accurate operating and emergency procedures, and effective training of personnel.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nKIK International operates a facility in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area which uses chlorine and 29% aqueous ammonia for the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products, such as bleach, fabric softener rinse, aqueous ammonia (two to three percent), and assorted liquid detergent products.  Chlorine and 29% aqueous ammonia are considered regulated substances.\n\nChlorine Process\n\nThe chlorine process begins with the unloading of one of two rail cars containing liquid chlorine at ambient temperatures and a gauge pressure ranging from approximately 90 to 150 pounds per square inch.  A moveable building covers the rail car valve compartment to capture any chlorine leaks.  The liquid chlorine flows from the rail car by its own vapor pressure or from pressure supplied by the air padding system.  The sodium hydroxide solution is prepared by diluting 50% sodium hydroxide with water in a blender to form the desired concentration for reaction with liquid chlorine in the reactor (i.e. chorine bleach plant).  The liquid chlorine is injected into the diluted caustic-filled reactor to form sodium hypochlorite.\n\nBleach strength is controlled by maintaining the "

      "SummaryText": "concentration of sodium hydroxide.  The concentration of sodium hydroxide is maintained automatically by ratio flow meters and comparative (flow) monitoring.  If an imbalance is identified, the system will automatically adjust.  The system is designed so that if a controller or comparator-fails, or a signal is not received, the system will automatically shutdown and isolate.  Samples to monitor the concentration and purity of the bleach are taken periodically, with operational adjustments made as necessary.  The bleach product is not considered a regulated substance.  \n\nEach of the chlorine rail cars contains 90 tons of liquid chlorine.  No more than one rail car is connected to the bleach plant at one time.  All materials are at ambient temperatures until combined in the reactor.  At this time the temperature of the bleach solution rises to approximately 125F due to heat release from the chemical reaction.  The chlorine piping at the rail cars can be purged of chlorine prior to disconnection.  The purge line as well as the moveable building's exhaust system are routed to a 500 gallon scrubber tank containing dilute caustic.  The chlorine purged from the line is neutralized by forming bleach.  All chlorine piping is double-walled and can be vented to the scrubber in the event of a leak.\n\nAqueous Ammonia Process\n\nThe facility receives 29% nominal concentration aqueous ammonia by tank truck and uses it to make household cleaning products containing 2 to 3% ammonia.  The 29% aqueous ammonia is stored in a 6,000 gallon atmospheric polyethylene tank and transferred by pump to one of three similar tanks, all with 6,000 gallon volumes, where dilution takes place.  The concentrated ammonia and dilution water are metered separately.\n\nA 12,000 gallon atmospheric tank filled with water is used for vapor recovery from the concentrated and dilute storage tanks.  This in turn vents into a 1,000 gallon tank.  A 500 gallon water tank has also been added to provide an alternate vent"

All tanks are within bermed areas.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations.  The facility conducts safety meetings and trains personnel who operate either the chlorine or aqueous ammonia systems.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine and aqueous ammonia systems, elated activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into KIK So Cal's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable aqueous ammonia or chlorine releases over the last five years (April 1999 - April 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate or shelter-in-place and await the arrival of responders from the City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department or in-house responders at the assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation or the shelter-in-place to be initiated.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation (April 2004) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at KIK So Cal.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine and aqueous ammonia systems since the initial PHA, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the initial PHA and 2002 PSM/RMP audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the review of chlorine and emergency response checklists, and a site inspection to review seismic issues.  The changes are scheduled to be completed by September, 2004.\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment f"

Continue to train all employees in Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management, EPA's Risk Management Program, and the California Accidental Release Prevention program.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining the above mentioned safety programs via the facility's Employee Participation program.\n3. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
