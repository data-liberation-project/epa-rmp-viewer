      "SummaryText": "A. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards facility, located in Madera, California, utilizes sulfur dioxide as a preservative for wine product.\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of a sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If a sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Commnunity Notification Plan would be activated.  If a sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system is a closed loop, and there are no emissions or planned releases of sulfur dioxide.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nPaul Masson Cellars and Vineyards transfers sulfur dioxide from one ton containers to portable canisters that are used throughout the facility.  The sulfur dioxide is pushed from the one ton containers to the portable canisters by pressurizing the one ton container with nitrogen gas.  Each portable canister has a liquid level site glass so the operator can monitor the level inside the canister. The portable canisters are then transported throughout the facility where neede"

      "SummaryText": "d.  The operation is conducted outside.  Bleed lines are in place to purge the process line.  The purge line transfers the process stream into a vent tank containing a bucket of water where the sulfur dioxide is safely contained.  Sulfur dioxide is soluble in water, therefore no emissions are produced.  The water in the vent tank is changed regularly in order to minimize the saturation of the water and to prevent the production of a highly corrosive gas in the form of sulfurous acid.    \n\nSulfur dioxide is the regulated substance of concern.  In the one-ton containers and the smaller cylinders, there is a maximum of 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide onsite at any one time.\n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards sulfur dioxide system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the sulfur dioxide system.  All sulfur dioxide one-ton containers are equipped with fusible relief plugs to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\nD.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has had no significant releases of sulfur dioxide over the past five years (May 2002-May 2007) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting form a sulfur dioxide release, nor any releases or \u00bfnear misses\u00bf that warranted an internal in"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards\u00bf Emergency Action Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthful working environment.  The policy at Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards  is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Action Plan outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards\u00bf Emergency Action Plan is included in the PSM/RMP documentation and focuses on responding to sulfur dioxide releases.\n\nResponse Organization and Notification Procedures \nIn the event of an accident, the operator should immediately notify his supervisor.  During the first few moments of the event, the witness should assess the situation as follows:\n\n1) How severe is the problem?\n2) Is there any personnel in danger?\n3) What is running at the time?\n4) Where is the leak source?\n5) What can be done about the leak?\n6) Has the hazard communication process been initiated?\n\nIf the operator was able to extinguish the emergency, then the accident investigator should be notified.  The accident investigator then proceeds to consider several questions as to the incidents surrounding the emergency.  The questions are numerous and include finding out key elements as to the occurrence of the accident.  Some key questions include the following:  \n\n1) Who was involved?  \n2) What was the accident? \n3) When did it occur? \n4) Why did the operator react the way he did? \n5) Where did the accident occur? How did he get injured? \n6) How could this be avoided in the future?\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\nIn the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, personnel will be instructed to vacate the premises to a designated assembly area, which will be upwind of the release.  The assembly area will be selected based on wind direction.  The facility's pr"

The secondary assembly location is at the northwest corner of the facility.\n\nMitigation Measures\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the sulfur dioxide system while exiting the area.  Cartridge respirators are maintained and personnel are trained for response with assistance from the Fire Department.\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Paul Masson Cellars and Vineyards facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
