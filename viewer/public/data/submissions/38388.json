The maximum amount of 37 percent formaldehyde stored on site is 65,000 pounds, or 24,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) formaldehyde.\n\nFlammable Substances:\n\n      Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine is received and stored on site as a 60 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on site is approximately 260,000 pounds.\n\n\nPrevention Program:\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical specific prevention steps have been developed. The key parts to the program are:  \n\n     Formal Company Risk Management Procedure that includes:\n          Management System Responsibilities\n          Risk Management Plan Coordinating Review Team\n          Risk Management Plan Changes and Updating\n          Recordkeeping Requirements\n          Communication and Coordination of Risk Management Information\n\n     DOT Hazardous Material Training\n     Contractor Performance Selection Process\n     Operating Procedures\n     Emergency Procedures\n     New Employee Environmental Health and Safety Orientation Training Program\n     Process Safety Program Auditing\n     Engineering Controls that Include Automatic Level and Interlock Alarms and Shutdowns\n     24 hour Emergency Communications\n\nAdditionally, the facility has programs to address the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements for the chemicals formaldehyde and dimethylamine such as:\n     \n     Employee Participation\n     Process Safety Information\n     Process Hazard Analysis\n     Operating Procedures\n     Training\n     Contractor Safety\n     Pre-startup Safety Reviews\n     Mechanical Integrity\n     Hot Work Permit\n     Management of Change\n     Incident Investigation\n     Emergency Planning and Response\n     Compliance Audits\n\n\nEmergency Response Prog"

The ERP has historically been coordinated with the site host, the General Chemical Corporation, and the Contra Costa County Health Services Department, Hazardous Materials Division.  As part of the community involvement efforts, the facility's management participates in the local CAER group efforts. \n\n\nSafety Improvement:\n\nPolychemie is committed to continuous improvement of safety.  Planned changes and policies to promote this improvement include the continuous review and update of the plant safety program and annual emergency drills to determine and improve upon deficiencies.  Efforts to update and implement additional safe work practices and policies are ongoing and include areas such as:\n\n     Hazard Communication\n     Confined Space Entry\n     Line Breaking Procedures\n     Lock out Tag out\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed. No accidental releases from covered processes have occurred that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or off site; or resulted in off-site evacuations or sheltering in place."
