As a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility, producing ammonia and other fertilizer products and utilizing ammonia as a feedstock; this facility is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n\nThe RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to submit Risk Management Plans for the prevention of accidental releases of these substances.  The Program requirements include submission of the Risk Management Plan, including a hazard assessment defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, a description of the accidental release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the RMP for KNC Enid Nitrogen Plant at Enid, Oklahoma.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Enid Nitrogen Plant is a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility consisting of two large scale, natural gas feed ammonia production units, a urea production unit, and an integrated urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) production unit.  These products are primarily used as agricultural fertilizers.  Ancillary facilities include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station and an Argon separation plant.\n\nInitial operation began in 1974 with the first ammonia unit, with major additions of the second ammonia unit in 1976, the urea unit in 1982, and the UAN unit in 1992.\n\nThe facility produces, handles, and stores ammonia in its operations.  The ammonia units use natural gas, air, and water for the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with by product carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer.  Urea-ammonium nitrate solution is produced by combining urea in liquid form wi"

Finally, chlorine is also present in regulated threshold quantities on the site.  It is used as an agent to control algae and bacteria in the cooling water systems associated with the production units.   \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.  It is this facility's policy to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and eliminate minor releases to the extent possible.  Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of this plant, to the safety of its employees, and to the safety of the general public.\n\nTo achieve its goals of accident and accidental release prevention, the facility is committed to the following:\n\n\u00b7\tA knowledgeable and highly trained and motivated employee group\n\u00b7\tA well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n\u00b7\tImprovements that enhance safety and accident prevention where appropriate\n\u00b7\tExcellence in safety programs and practices and a superior safety and accident record\n\u00b7\tPreparation and training for emergency response and mitigation\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Enid Nitrogen Plant adheres to the requirements of OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of the PSM and EPA Prevention Programs.

Alternative release scenarios, which are more reasonably likely events, for each regulated toxic and flammables in general must also be presented.\n\nWorst-Case Toxic Release - Ammonia\n\nBecause of the seasonal nature of fertilizer use and application in agriculture, large quantities of the ammonia produced at this facility must be stored until needed by farmers for application.  The RMP Rule requires that the largest amount in a single vessel be considered the release quantity for the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf event unless smaller quantities handled at different conditions result in a greater distance to the regulated endpoint.  \n\nFor this facility, the largest single quantity of ammonia is held in the cryogenic storage tanks.    This quantity can total 30,000 tons in each tank.  KNC also modeled the 200-ton pressure storage tanks in which warm ammonia is held for shipment and for use in facility plants.  The hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release assumes, as required by the rule, that the entire amount of one full tank is released as a result of a catastrophic failure.  The weather conditions must be those that create the longest affected distance.  These unlikely events were modeled by a publicly available model (DEGADIS), which is known to provide reasonable estimates of concentrations and distances associated with release events. \n\nIn the case of the Enid facility, the release of 200 tons of warm ammonia created the worst offsite consequence.  This is because the 30,000-ton storage tanks hold the ammonia at -28 oF inside a diked area, which limits the size of the pool of ammonia.  The 200-ton pressure tanks hold the liquid ammonia at 40 to 60 oF, which causes more rapid vaporization.\n\nIn addition, a hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf failure of a chlorine container was similarly modeled, with a smaller plume distance than the 200-ton ammonia tank. \n\nIt should be emphasized that the possibility of such an event as described by the worst ca"

Facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, and substantially reduce the probability of such massive and improbable failures.\n\nWorst-Case Release - Flammable Substances\n\nAs the rule requires, the largest quantity flammable release and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion must be analyzed as the hypothetical \u00bfworst case\u00bf for these substances.  In this facility, a failure releasing the entire contents of the ammonia synthesis loop constitutes the largest flammable release.  This quantity is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion with impact distance determined by the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis formulas.  Although large volumes of flammable gases are handled daily by the plant, actual in-process inventory is relatively small, especially considering the inert gases and steam in the mixtures.  Offsite impact distance is relatively limited as a result.\n\nAlternative Release - Toxics \n\nAmmonia\n\nMore reasonably likely release events tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled such as loading and other transport activities.  Substantially lower quantities are involved, various shutdown safeguards are present as they are throughout the plant, and operator intervention all tend to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.  Such events can include failure of smaller valves, lines, and hoses.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario, modeled with the DEGADIS model for this facility, is the breaking off of a \u00be - inch vent and drain valve from the ammonia truck and rail loading system.  The modeled offsite impact distance is substantially lower for more reasonable, but still not necessarily likely release events.\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is used at several locations in this plant as a biocidal agent for the cooling water systems, much as it is also used in swimming pools.

This release was modeled using the DEGADIS dispersion program.  \n\nFlammables\n\nVolumes of flammable gases are handled throughout the plant, even though actual physical inventory is relatively low, given the quantity of inert gases and steam in the mixtures.  More likely flammable release events include failures of smaller pipes and lines or blowing relief valves in comparison to the large release contemplated in the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf analysis.\n\nThe alternative release scenario assumed an extended blowing of the synthesis gas compressor relief valve due to a loss of reaction in the synthesis converter.  The relief valve lifts to maintain loop pressure while the synthesis compressor continues to send gas to the synthesis loop.  The time was extended to three minutes in order to vent enough gas to provide an off-site consequence.  The scenario also assumes no wind and that the gas cloud, which consists of mostly hydrogen and inert gases, stays intact.    The impact distance calculation for this event utilized the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis formulas.  More reasonable events resulted in minimal impact distances.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Prevention Program/PSM Program.  Formal process hazard analysis is conducted at least every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur continuously as needs are identified through these procedures and policies."
