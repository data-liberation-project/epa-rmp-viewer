              "Description": "The Westbrook Energy Center burns natural gas in two gas turbines which are connected to generators that create electricity.  The exhaust heat from the turbines is sent through a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) where its thermal energy is used to heat water and create steam.  The steam can then be utilized in a steam turbine which is also attached to a generator thereby increasing the output of electricity.  This type of plant set-up (known as \"combined-cycle\") is extremely efficient and very common.\n\nThe 29.5% aqueous ammonia solution is used to reduce toxic emissions from exhaust gasses.  The gas exiting the gas turbines contains oxides of nitrogen.  These nitrogen oxides are almost entirely removed through selective catalyst reduction (SCR) using the ammonia.\n\nThe ammonia is drawn from a tank located outside of the power plant via transfer pumps to the ammonia skid.  There, it is diluted with flue gasses and heated in a vaporizer and injected into the gas stream, then into the catalyst bed.  It is in the catalyst bed that the ammonia reacts with nitrogen oxides forming nitrogen and water. \n\nThese harmless substances are then exhausted into the atmosphere via the plant stack.  An automatic control and monitoring system regulates the vapor flow.  The entire ammonia storage, vaporization, and injection cycle is relatively simple when compared to other ammonia systems.  It was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable standards and is operated per standard industry practices.",

As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in a 29.5% aqueous solution in a 20,000 gallon vertical tank.  The ammonia is piped in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is diluted with air and heated to a gas.  This gas is injected into the turbine exhaust gases in the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG).  \n\nApproximately 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is utilized on site as a refrigerant.  The purpose of this refrigeration sytem is to enhance gas turbine performance during the summer months by cooling the inlet air.  An initial ammonia delivery consisting of two trucks will fill the system.  This initial fill is expected to last for the life of the system will small \"re-charges\" taking place about every 3-5 years.\n\nThe facility has strictly implemented preventative maintenance procedures and an Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the ERP and contains all emergency contact numbers as well as employee safety and mitigation procedures.  As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for employees on Hazardous Materials Handling. Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center is a newly constructed facility as of December, 2000 and therefore has had no ammonia related accidents or releases.\n\nThe facility modeled two off-site consequence analyses for aqueous ammonia.  The first was a worst-case scenario that consisted of a full release of the aqueous ammonia storage tank which, due to administrative proce"

This scenario had a toxic endpoint radius of 0.3 miles.  The second analysis was an alternative release scenario that consisted of a delivery hose rupture.  The release would cause 500 pounds of aqueous ammonia to be spilled at a rate of 100 lbs/min for 5 minutes.  This scenario established a toxic endpoint radius of 0.1 miles.\n\nThe facility also modeled two off-site consequance analyses for anhydrous ammonia.  The worst-case scenario entailed a ruptured receiver.  This receiver is the largest containment vessel in the system and holds 19,400 pounds.  With an evaporation rate of 1940 lbs per minute, the analyses showed a toxic end point of 4.6 miles.  The alternative release scenario was based on a ruptured disk/relief valve having released 360 pounds of ammonia.  The tosic endpoint radius was 446 yards in this scenario.\n\nThe Westbrook Energy Center has completed and is actively implementing a Risk Management Plan.  The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of the RMP."
