The goal of this policy is to reduce the risk to Plant employees and to protect the public and the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n        The process at the wastewater treatment plant subject to the RMP regulations is the chlorination/dechlorination system, which manages greater than threshold quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\n        Based on EPA criteria, the worst-case release scenario at the Wastewater Treatment Plant is the catastrophic failure of the sulfur dioxide rail car used to store sulfur dioxide.  This is extremely unlikely since the rail car steel tank is nearly two-inches thick along with the additional safeguards described in the Prevention Program.\n\n        The worst of the several alternative release scenarios considered for chlorine is the catastrophic failure of a one-inch liquid pipe or valve (e.g., 1-in. pressure relief valve on rail car).   In order for the reported toxic end point distance to be achieve, the excess flow valves on the chlorine rail car would also have to fail.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant designed to prevent this from occurring, however, for emergency response planning purposes they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\n        The worst of the several alternative release scenarios considered for sulfur dioxide is the catastrophic failure of a one-inch liquid pipe or valve.
