Its warehouse and storage facility located at 100 Quantico Ave. in Bakersfield, California, store various chemicals for resale.  The chemicals are purchased from manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored temporarily and reloaded for shipment to the customer.  The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n(a) Argo Chemical is basically a retail operation and not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  However, Argo chooses to incorporate all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n(b) The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\nCompressed Chlorine Gas\nThis product is handled by Argo Chemical in one ton and in 150 pounds pressurized cylinders.  The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift.  The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel.  For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport. \n\nCompressed Sulfur Dioxide\nThis product is handled by Argo Chemical in one ton pressurized cylinders.  The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift.  The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel.  For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport.\n\n\n(c) In the highly unlikely event (worst-case scenario) of a mechanical failure of one of the cylinders"

      "SummaryText": " containing the compressed gas, a release of the contents of the cylinder may occur and have offsite consequences.  An alternative scenario involves a release of the compressed gas through a 1/8-inch in diameter hole in the cylinder wall caused by corrosion.  Minimum offsite consequences may result from such an alternative release scenario. \n\n(d) Argo Chemical has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Instructions, Compliance Audits and Training. \n\n(e) In its entire business history of nearly 20 years, while handling regulated compressed gases, Argo Chemical has not had any accidental releases.\n\n(f) Argo Chemical has an Emergency Response Plan and coordinates its activities with all applicable Governmental Agencies. \n\n(g) Argo Chemical is committed to safe and responsible distribution of chemical products.  Operating Procedures review and enhanced training of personnel in the safe handling of all chemical products is a continuing goal of Argo Chemical, Inc. Forklift operations and truck-loading training ongoing.  As technology and operation changes occur, additional training and improvement in loading equipment will be implemented.\n"
