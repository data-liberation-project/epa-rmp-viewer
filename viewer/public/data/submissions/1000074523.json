      "SummaryText": "BACKGROUND: The Elm Road Generating Station (ERGS) is a coal-fired steam electric generating facility that generates electricity for distribution on the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (doing business as We Energies) system.  We Energies has constructed and operates a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) air pollution control system on ERGS Units 1 and 2 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides.  The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia (greater than 20% concentration).  The aqueous ammonia is contained in two ammonia storage tanks and is injected into the flue gas (exhaust gas) exiting from the Units 1 and 2 boiler systems.  The ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides in the flue gas to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.  Operating the SCR systems requires that the amount of aqueous ammonia in the ammonia storage tanks at any given time exceeds the threshold value specified in U.S. EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  Releases from the ammonia storage tanks, which are diked, were evaluated as required by the RMP regulations.  The diked ammonia storage tanks would minimize the pooled surface area created by a release, thereby reducing the amount of ammonia that could be released into the surrounding atmosphere and minimize off-site impacts.\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING: The facility's prevention and emergency response approach includes the implementation of U.S. EPA's RMP regulations; OSHA process safety management program; and emergency response procedures developed specifically for the facility by the We Energies and the Milwaukee County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Continuing employee safety training ensures the ongoing commitment to continual safety improvement.  The facility has personnel trained in OSHA HAZWOPER emergency response requirements and has a designated outside emergency response contractor.  The ammonia storage tanks are diked to minimize heal"
