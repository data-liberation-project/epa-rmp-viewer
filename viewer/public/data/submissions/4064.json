      "SummaryText": "West Biloxi Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nRMP Plan Executive Summary\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the West Biloxi Wastewater Treatment Plant (West Biloxi WWTP), one of several facilities owned by the Harrison County Wastewater and Solid Waste Management District and operated by Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI).\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\nOMI believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, OMI has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the West Biloxi WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  OMI has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the West Biloxi WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, OMI affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\nOMI takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates b"

The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nOMI management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the West Biloxi WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\nAs for emergency response, OMI has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe West Biloxi WWTP is located at 370 Rosalie Maria Drive in Biloxi, Harrison County, Mississippi.  The West Biloxi WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  This activated sludge plant has aerobic digesters, a 2.0-meter belt filter press, and secondary clarification.  Average design flow is 9 MGD, with a peak capacity of 27.1 MGD.  Sludge is transported to a disposal site by a separate contractor.  OMI developed an equipment repair program and an ongoing training program.\nThe West Biloxi WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of eight containers (16,000 pounds) on site.  In addition, the West Biloxi WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended invento"

Therefore, the West Biloxi WWTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that a full one-ton container of chemical is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions as specified in the RMP regulation are also assumed to be present.  The release is also assumed to occur outdoors.\n\nFor the alternative release scenario, the facility reviewed the consequences of a valve breaking off at the container connector during hookups in the storage area.  No active mitigation was considered.  The same scenario was assumed for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nResults of the off-site consequence analyses are described in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*Submit plan for the West Biloxi WWTP.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the West Biloxi WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n7 Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n\n7 Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of:  the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls\n\n7 Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and"

Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the West Biloxi WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the West Biloxi WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process."
