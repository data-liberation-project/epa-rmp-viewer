All operators of the facility undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the facility.  This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Ascension Parish Fire and State Police Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  We are a active member of the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) Association which provide additional assistance in emergencies.  We also maintain a fire brigade on each shift to handle small emergencies.\n \nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility produce Renewable Synthetic Diesel Fuel.  LPG is a by-product for resale to retail propane outlets.  The facility has one 90,000-gallon LPG tank.\n \nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  Our worst-case scenario is failure of the 90,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (70% at ambient temperature), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.6 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors are not within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a BLEVE of the LPG tank and release of 333,000 lbs and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (0.7 miles) extends offsite, and public receptors are not within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicabl"

      "SummaryText": "e state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  Five-year accident history will be documented in that time frame as the facility initial start up is scheduled on or about May 1, 2010.  \n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Ascension Parish Fire and State Police Departments and request that they help respond to the emergency.  The Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) Association will also be available to assist the facility.  Employees will be trained in CPR, Incipient Fire Brigade and Fire Extinguishers.  We have coordinated our response plans with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.  All Team members are taught in Hazard Communication to report any observed chemical leaks/spills and odors to their supervisor or lead person immediately.  Supervisors and Leads are taught to report the above to the Plant Manager, Environmental/Health & Safety Manager, and Operations Manager immediately for investigation and follow-up action.  MSDS information books are accessible to all team members for review.\n \nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Upgrade systems as needed."
