Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source:\n\nDynamic Metal Treating has adheres to the Federal and State regulations and in compliance with the OSHA requirements for handling of anhydrous ammonia and the OSHA process management standard. Employees of the facilities are trained in their roles and responsibilities in implementing prevention and emergency response. Should an emergency occur, it the company's policy to notify the Canton Township Fire department and request that they respond to the emergency situation \n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a bulk tank at the facility. The facility is a commercial heat treating facility.\n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including the administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for the reported scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the facility is the potential accidental release of the anhydrous ammonia from the tank when full. The distance corresponding to the release of 52000 lbs of ammonia release is 2.60 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the release through the transfer line connecting the tank with the transfer hose of anhydrous ammonia delivery truck that loads the tank. The transfer occurs in a supervised environment. If this scenario were to occur, the liquid in the transfer line empties out followed by the check valve shut-off thus limiting the loss to the contents of the line (approximately 50 lbs). The supervisor/attendant will then close the main valve at the tank. The maximum distance corresponding to the this release is less than 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4.
