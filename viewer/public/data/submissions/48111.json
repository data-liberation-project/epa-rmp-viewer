All chemicals can be handled in a safe manner, and any chemical can produce injury if used in an unsafe manner, whether it is minor or major injury. Some examples would be using safety gloves for highly acidic chemicals and using self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) when working with chlorine gas and in confined spaces where oxygen deprived air would be a possibility. In developing the emergency plan for the accidental leakage of chlorine gas, the following safety precautions will be taken:\n1. Yearly training on all phases of safety pertaining to chlorine gas. This will include using the chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Kit, utilizing the self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and safe handling procedures of the chlorine ton cylinders.\n2. Cross training with area Rural Fire Departments, the City of Mena Fire Department, and Law Enforcement Departments. The cross training is for the education of these area departments which will be utilized for the evacuation and isolation of possible contaminated areas within the evacuation area.\n3. Working with the City of Mena Fire Department, which has a first responder team and has had training in hazardous chemicals. This team will assist Mena Water Utilities in the event of a hazardous chemical leakage. They will not be responsible for the containment or elimination of the leakage.\n4. Creating a first responder team consisting of personnel from Mena Water Utilities. This team will be responsible for the containment and elimination of the chlorine leak.\n5.

A good maintenance program in all things is the answer to malfunction and breakdown problems that may arise. Maintenance of the chlorine system could prevent leakage problems in the future.  Daily inspection of ton chlorine cylinders and testing feed valve for any possible sings of leakage will be a priority of daily duty requirements. This will allow action to be taken before the leak would become a major risk factor. Mena Water Utilities will be working closely with area Rural Fire Departments, the Mena Fire Department, and our Law Enforcement Agencies to ensure that proper training and cross training will take place so that expedient, correct, and safe measures can be taken to limit the amount of chlorine leakage that may occur and to ensure safe and expedient evacuation if this course of action is necessary. After evacuation of residents, they would only be allowed to return to their homes after the air quality has been determined to be safe.

This Treatment Facility is responsible for the safe production of a potable water supply to the customers connected to the public water utilizing specific chemicals into the treatment facility for the purpose of treating the water to exceed the minimum required standards set forth by the State of Arkansas Regulating Agency. These chemicals include only one chemical that would impose immediate health threats if leakage occurred. This chemical is chlorine gas, liquefied by pressure. Chlorine gas is stored at the treatment facility in two thousand pound (ton) cylinders. This chlorine gas is compressed by pressure to form a liquid; the bottom section of the cylinder is liquid, while the top section is gas. It is the top section (gas) which injects chlorine into our water treatment process; pressure is lowered within the cylinder. This allows more of the liquid chlorine to be \u00bfdecompressed\u00bf into chlorine gas, which can then be fed into the treatment process by our chlorine feeders. The maximum quantity of chlorine (one ton) is connected to the chlorine feeder, while the other two are used for storage until needed.\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S)\nA worst case scenario and a general accidental release of chlorine will be treated the same way. It is not known if it will be a worst case scenario until the feed valve on the cylinder is completely closed. If the valve is completely closed and leakage still occurs, the operator will then decide if the leak is large enough to evacuate the worst case evacuation plan, or if it will be an alternative release with only the alternative release evacuation are being evacuated.

This will allow those responsible for evacuation to take action without any further information needed. Evacuation and containment or elimination of leakage will be further covered in the emergency response program portion of this emergency plan.\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nIn the event an accidental leakage of chlorine gas occurs, the operator on duty should immediately try to isolate the leak by turning the feeder valve to the off position. If immediate elimination of the chlorine leakage is not achieved by this method, the operator should immediately evacuate the site to an area residence, call 911 and notify them of a hazardous chemical leak (chlorine) at the Irons Fork Water Treatment Facility. The 911 operator would then dispatch the first responder team and notify the Rural Fire Departments, the Mena Fire Department, and Local Law Enforcement Offices in order to being evacuations. Only trained personnel, who are equipped with self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) should investigate or work to contain or eliminate any leakage that may occur; all other persons should be kept away from the contaminated area. Only persons with routine annual training in the use of the chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Kit for ton cylinders and trained in the use of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) will be considered as trained personnel; preferably cross trained in utilizing the chlorine \u00bfB\u00bf Kit while wearing the self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).
