      "SummaryText": "Accidental Releases and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Valspar's policy to operate it's plants in a manner that protects its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The Valspar Rockford facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Action Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Valspar Rockford Facility manufactures consumer paint, paint resin and water based colorants.\n\nThe resin manufacturing process uses toluene diisocyanate as a raw material.  The facility stores toluene diisocyanate in a 6,000 gallon storage tank and the maximum amount on site at one time is 60,720 pounds.  The tank, which is isolated in a closed room within the building, was designed and built in accordance with sound and current engineering standards, local building codes, and state law.\n\nThe facility also has a connected warehouse which stores consumer paint and paint related products.  Aerosol paint cans which utilize propane as the propellant are stored in this warehouse.  Because of the propane, the warehouse storage process is also covered under the Risk Management Plan rule.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, the worst case release scenario was calculated by assuming the entire contents of the largest container were released.  A rupture of the toluene diisocyanate storage tank was considered to be the worst case release scenario for the resin manufacturing process.  This scenario is very unlikely due to the design and maintenance of the storage tank.  The room was assumed to act as an enclosure that would retard migration of the volatilized toluene diisocyanate from the room.  The effectiveness of the room as an enclosure was assumed to be 55 percent in accordance with USEPA guidance.  The toluene diisocyanate was assumed to be contained within the dike formed by the walls of  the room.  According to EPA guidance for calculat"

      "SummaryText": "ing the consequence of a toluene diisocyanate release, the distance to endpoint for a release of 60,720 pounds was calculated to be 21 feet or 0.004 miles.  The EPA has determined that toluene diisocyanate does not pose a threat to the public at this distance.  Because of the limitations in the software provided by EPA, the distance of 0.1 miles had to be entered when in actuality, the distance was 0.004 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nA rupture of a single 16 ounce spray was considered the worst case scenario for storage of aerosol cans.  The can contains 0.4 pounds of propane and the release would result in a vapor cloud explosion.   According to EPA's RMP*Comp (TM) Version 1.02 software and EPA's OCA Guidance, the distance to endpoint 0.006 miles or 18 feet.  Because of limitations in the software provided by EPA, the distance to endpoint had to be entered as 0.1 miles and the quantity of material released as 1 pound.  The actual amount of material released is 0.4 pounds which results in a distance to endpoint of 0.006 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Programs\n\nThe Rockford Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the resin manufacturing process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.  Numerous safeguards are in place and include operational procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.  The facility uses both procedural as well as technological systems to ensure safe handling of toluene diisocyanate.  The toluene diisocyanate bulk storage tank is isolated inside a room within the plant.  Should a leak in the t"

      "SummaryText": "ank occur, the toluene diisocyanate would be contained within the room.  The storage room is equipped with an electronic detection device that warns personnel of a release.  All remaining tanks and piping that handle toluene diisocyanate are monitored by a second device.  Both devices are equipped with a visible alarm and audible alarm.  Toluene diisocyanate is delivered to the facility in bulk tank trucks.  The truck is unloaded outside the storage room on a concrete pad with diked containment.  The pad is sloped so that spills would drain into the toluene diisocyanate storage room.  The facility has specific procedures for handling toluene diisocyanate and all personnel are trained on these procedures.  Annual training is conducted on the chemical hazards of toluene diisocyanate.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Rockford Facility has never had an accident involving toluene diisocyanate or propane that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving toluene diisocyanate or propane, we will immediately notify the Rockford Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  The Fire Department has a well-trained emergency response team and is familiar with our processes.  We have contracted with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWe have an ongoing and continuing process to update and review our manufacturing and storage processes for safety considerations."
