              "Description": "The NGL Supply Terminal Company, West Vancouver terminal is located at 5701 N.W. Old Lower River Rd., Vancouver, WA.  This facility provides for the transfer of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars to stationary above ground storage tanks.  Product is moved to storage tanks using a fixed rail car unloading system via pressure differential, and pumped from storage tanks to transport trucks and trailers using liquid transfer pumps.  A Process Safety Management program has been prepared and implemented at the terminal.  This program uses a systematic approach to evaluate the whole process.    Various emergency shutdown and backup lines of defense have been incorporated in the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of LPG.  The facility began operations February 2011 and was built with new systems.  Every five years or sooner if warranted, processes will be evaluated and strengthened where required to assure their effectiveness.  NGL Supply Terminal Company has developed standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process consistent with the process safety information.  Operating procedures for the process will be reviewed by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team, engineering staff, and operating personnel to ensure that they are accurate and provide practical instructions on how to actually carry out job duties safely.  NGL Supply Terminal Company has developed and implemented an emergency action plan to facilitate the prompt response, notification and evacuation of employees due to an unwanted release of LPG.  The site emergency planning and response procedures describe the actions to be taken by all responding personnel to potential emergency situations at the NGL Supply Terminal Company West Vancouver terminal.",

Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. NGL has developed a comprehensive Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance. The accident prevention program includes compliance with ongoing mechanical integrity inspections, which includes the API RP 510 Pressure Vessel Inspection Program and API RP 570 Piping Inspection Program.  In addition, the facility conducts 3 year PSM Compliance Audits.  If an emergency were to occur, it is NGL's policy to notify the City of Vancouver Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. The Vancouver Terminal also maintains incipient stage firefighting equipment on site. Additionally, the facility has been equipped with fire suppression cannon nozzles along the facility perimeter. This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is NGL's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility came online new in 2011 and is annually inspected for compliance by the City of Vancouver. \n\n\n\nA description of the West Vancouver Terminal facility and the regulated substances handled: \n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG for resale to retail butane and propane dealers.
