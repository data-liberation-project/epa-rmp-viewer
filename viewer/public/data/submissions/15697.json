      "SummaryText": "  Big Creek Utility is located near the end of the Cumberland Plateau in a mountainous region.  The area is surrounded with cliffs and bluffs with very low populations.  Several state and local forests entwine the area and two National Parks are near the treatment facility but are not in the area described for the worst case scenario.\n    Big Creek Utility District's process release prevention program combines technologies, procedures and management practices.  The Risk Management Plan incorporates the existing plant Emergency Response Program which is tailored to Big Creek Utilities treatment process' and is in compliance with the Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n    Big Creek Utility District uses chlorine in the pre treatment and post treatment of potable drinking water for 85% of Grundy County and two other neighboring counties.  The chlorine process is located in the Water Treatment Plant chlorine room and is attached to main treatment facility.  This room contains three one ton chlorine cylinders.\n    The Water Treatment Facility is manned 16 hours a day by two operators and the Manager five days a week from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM Monday to Friday, and from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM by a single operator on Saturday and Sunday.  During the week as many as three Distribution personnel may be in or near the treatment facility.\n    The worst case scenario modeling was performed using the EPA assumptions and concluded with a distance to end point of 2.9 miles and an estimated population of 1500 people."
