      "SummaryText": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Chester Water Authority (CWA) operates the Octoraro Water Treatment Plant in Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Water from Octoraro Reservoir, and the Susquehanna River, is treated by conventional physical and chemical processes to meet drinking water standards.  These processes include disinfection with chlorine.\n\nCWA carefully stores and handles chlorine to prevent its accidental release.  This Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describes the chemical hazards and explains what CWA is doing to prevent an accidental release.  It has been developed and implemented in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) and guidelines specifically created for water treatment plants (WTPs).\n\nCWA purchases chlorine (CAS Number 7782-50-5) as a compressed liquefied gas from commercial suppliers.  In the disinfection process, liquid chlorine is fed to a vaporizer where the liquid is converted to a gas and then injected under vacuum into the treated drinking water. CWA\u00bfs chlorine inventory exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds established under the RMP regulations. The Octoraro WTP also uses ammonia, but the maximum inventory is below the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds; therefore, CWA\u00bfs ammonia use is not regulated under RMP. \n\nCWA\u00bfs Policies, Release Prevention, and Emergency Response programs for chlorine are described in the following subsections. \n\n2. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Chester Water Authority has a policy that addresses its commitment to accident prevention and risk management. This policy reads as follows:\n\n\u00bfThe Chester Water Authority is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  CWA will implement safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazar"

If there is an accidental release, CWA will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response to minimize the effect of the release. CWA will also immediately notify the public, through county emergency management agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\u00bf\n\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, CWA\u00bfs Octoraro Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases that resulted in injuries or damages. Under the RMP regulations, all accidental releases of a regulated substance that \u00bfresulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\u00bf within the past 5 years must be reported.  \n\n4. PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, three levels of prevention program requirements have been established to roughly match the level of effort to the risk of off-site impacts.  Because the offsite consequence analysis showed that the worst-case release scenario could impact offsite public receptors, and because the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) is not applicable at this facility, CWA\u00bfs Octoraro WTP must meet RMP Program 2 Prevention Program requirements for its chlorination process.  CWA\u00bfs Prevention Program is summarized below.\n\nA.  Management System:\n\nCWA has developed a management program that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program to the Chief of Treatment and Pumping at the Octoraro WTP. The management program also clearly delineates accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements.\n\nB.  Safety Information:\n\nUp-to-date safety information related to the chlorination process is maintained at the plant and is used by plant operators who are responsible for operating the chlorination system.  It includes the following:\n\n\u00bf Material Safety Data Sheets"

The safety information is updated any time a major change is made to the process that renders the original information inaccurate.\n\nC. Hazard Review:  \n\nCWA performed an initial hazard review of its chlorination system using the WTP Hazard Review Checklist for Simple Chlorine Feed Systems found in the Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.  CWA recently conducted another Hazard Review on 9 June 2004 using a Review Checklist for Chlorine Vaporizers (based in part on The Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 9, Chlorine Vaporizer Systems) and a Review Checklist for Chlorine Systems from the Chlorine Institute Chlorine Manual. These checklists satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.50.  Any safety issues identified during this review were documented and a schedule has been developed for their resolution.  A copy of the completed hazard review checklists is maintained with the safety information for the Octoraro WTP chlorination system.  \n\nIn the future, CWA will update this review checklist at least every five years or after any major modification to the chlorination process.  \n\nPrior to CWA\u00bfs first hazard review (in 1999), a formal safety inspection of the chlorination system was conducted by a representative of the EPA Regio"

The EPA recommended several modifications to improve the safety of the chlorination process and CWA quickly acted to implement the recommended modifications.  A follow-up inspection was conducted by the EPA on 31 May 1996, and soon after, CWA received a letter from the EPA commending the facility for its commitment to accidental release prevention and mitigation. A subsequent EPA visit on 29 October 1999 achieved similar results.\n\nD.  Operating Procedures: \n\nDetailed and up-to-date operating procedures (OPs) have been developed and are maintained for the chlorination process at the Octoraro WTP in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.  These OPs provide clear step-by-step instructions for safely conducting activities involving the chlorination process in a manner consistent with the chlorine safety information, and are readily available to all employees responsible for working with the chlorination process.  These OPs are reviewed and updated as necessary prior to startup following any major modifications to the chlorination process.\n\nThese OPs cover each operating phase of the chlorination process including normal operations, temporary operations, temporary shutdown, emergency shutdown, and startup following an emergency or temporary shutdown.  The OPs contain special warnings and precautions for any procedures that could be dangerous if performed incorrectly.  Where appropriate, the OPs identify the consequences of deviating from the standard procedure, and also provide instructions on how to correct or avoid such deviations.  \n\nE.  Training  \n\nAll new employees who work with the chlorination system at the Octoraro WTP receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR 68.54.  The training includes an overview of the chlorination process and equipment and emphasizes standard operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown.  \n\nRefresher training is provided at a minimum of every 3 y"

Maintenance:\n\nA maintenance program for the chlorination system at the Octoraro WTP has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.56.  Employees responsible for the maintenance of the chlorination equipment receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure they can perform the job in a safe manner.\n\nWritten procedures and checklists are used to ensure that the chlorination equipment is properly maintained, tested, and inspected at regularly scheduled intervals and that these activities are thoroughly documented.  Maintenance, inspection, and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with manufacturer\u00bfs recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection, and testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nG.  Compliance Audits:\n\nThe continued compliance of the Risk Management Program for the chlorination system at the Octoraro WTP is ensured through compliance audits that are performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.58.  The audits are completed by the plant\u00bfs Chief of Treatment and Pumping with the assistance of those who operate and maintain the chlorination process and an individual outside the Octoraro WTP.
