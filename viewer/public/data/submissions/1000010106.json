This document has been prepared in order to address the following issue:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tAcknowledge the construction and operation of a new source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfgeneral duty clause\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tidentify hazards\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tdesign and maintain a safe facility\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tprevent releases\n\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf\tminimize consequences of releases\nThe accepted approach to accomplishing the above is to have a documented RMP, which outlines all the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. OMEC has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP in advance of operation of the aqueous ammonia system in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\nThe RMP applies to the OMEC facility located at:\n\n647 Alta Road, San Diego, CA 92154\n\nThe proposed OMEC facility is a natural gas fired combined cycle (2:1) nominal rated 600 megawatt (MW) powerplant. The facility consists of two combustion turbines and common to both turbines is a steam turbine generator. The facility is proposing to install a \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfselective catalytic reducti"

Aqueous ammonia will be stored in a stationary storage tank rated at 16,000 gallons, filled to 85 percent capacity. Aqueous ammonia will be delivered to the site approximately every 6 days.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored:  Aqueous Ammonia 29.4 Percent Solution (CAS# 7664-41-7)\n\nFacility SIC: 4911\tNAICS Code: 221112\n\nThe proposed facility would not be subject to the Process Safety Management provisions of 29 CFR 1910 and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 8 Section 5189. Based on the above, the proposed facility would be classified as a Program Level 2 source. The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 4.0 and 14.0, respectively.

Review of the piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) indicates that there are numerous pressure, temperature, and level indicator sensors, which will be reported directly to the distributed control system (DCS) for operator confirmation and action.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPresently, Calpine is operating a number of similar peaking and base loaded power generation facilities in California. Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the OMEC facility. Operational and safety issues identified at any Calpine facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites.
