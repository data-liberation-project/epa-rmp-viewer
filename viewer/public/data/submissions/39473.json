Facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Farmers Elevator & Exchange, Inc. (the facility) are committed to the prevention of Any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the site is the receipt, storage and sale, for direct application or for sale to local area farmers, of anhydrous ammonia as a crop production nutrient (nitrogen). The ammonia is stored in: 1 - 30,000 gallon, 1 - 18,000 gallon, 2 - 6,000 gallon and 55 1,000 gallon, 8 1500, 4 2000, pressurized, steel tanks with a estimated total storage capicity of about 569,650 lbs.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios: A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents as a gas of the largest storage tank (30,000 gallons or about 131,325 pounds). It would  occur over a period of 10 minutes and the release would be about 131,325 pounds which represents the total volume of the largest storage tank at 85 % capacity as limited by designb standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 2.6 miles. B) The Alternative Case Scenario, based on the Five Year Accident history, or the most likely incident, is a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose. It is estimated that about 26,640 pounds would be released over a period of 2 minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off valve intervenes to stop the flow of ammonia. The distance to the endpoint (point of diospersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental release Prevention Program: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with tghe provisions o"

The ANSI Standard has been adopted br reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule43.6(200), Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no acci8dental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: The facility has: A)  a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: safe4ty improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage opr use of anhydrous ammonia proposed at this time."
