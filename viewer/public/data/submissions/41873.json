      "SummaryText": "The toxic area affected would be within a 1.9-mile radius around the plant.  The areas affected would include the City of Connellsville, South Connellsville, Dunbar, and portions of Dunbar Township, and Connellsville Township.  The release of all 8,000 lbs. of chlorine is highly unlikely, as this would require the simultaneous leak of four individual storage cylinders.\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\n\nAn alternate release scenario would involve the release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas from one storage cylinder.  This release would cause potentially hazardous off-site impacts to an area within a  0.9-mile radius around the plant.  The areas affected would include South Connellsville and portions of Connellsville, Dunbar Township and Connellsville Township. \n\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n\nDuring the last five years, the plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine gas.\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan:\n \nIn the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas, a leak detector would alert plant personnel of a hazardous condition.  The severity of the leak would be determined.  The Fayette County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) would be immediately notified.  The Fayette County LEPC would alert all required state and local agencies as may be necessary to respond to the emergency.  All plant personnel are fully aware of the extreme potentially hazardous conditions that may occur in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  \n\nIn the future an air scrubber may be installed in the chlorine room to remove any chlorine gas that may be accidentally leaked.  The air scrubber will prevent discharge of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.\n\nAnother possible improvement to the plant would be to replace chlorine gas with Sodium HypoChlorite (NaOCl).  Sodium HypoChlorite does not have the potentially hazardous impacts as chlorine gas."

Box 1515\n             Lanham-Seabrook, Maryland 20703-1515\n\nFrom:    The North Fayette County Municipal Authority\n             P.O. Box 368\n             Dunbar, PA 15431\n\nSubject:   Risk Management Plan \n               Executive Summary\n\nFacility:    Filtration Plant A\n\n\nAccident Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe management and staff of the North Fayette County Municipal Authority (NFCMA) are fully committed to the safe handling, storage and use of all chemicals utilized in the drinking water purification process.  Safety and emergency response procedures and policies are in place and serve as guides to insure that the accidental leakage of chemicals is prevented and that emergencies are handled appropriately. \n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe NFCMA is a municipally owned water authority with approximately 14,300 customers.  The NFCMA's treatment plant is permitted by the State of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection (Public Water System ID No.: 5260019) for 11.7 millions of gallons of water per day.  In the treatment process at the plant, various chemicals are used to produce a quality finished water supply.  All of those chemicals utilized at the plant are stored in approved storage vessels and are all handled in a safe manner.\n\nOne of the chemicals used at the plant is chlorine gas.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process to kill bacteria and other harmful pathogens.  The plant stores a maximum of 8,000 lbs. of chlorine gas. The chlorine gas is pressurized to a liquid state and is contained in four (4) - one ton cylinders.\n\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of 8,000 lbs. of chlorine gas.  The release of this quantity of gas would have potentially hazardous off-site impacts."
