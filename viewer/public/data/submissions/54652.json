This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nQuestar\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.  Questar\u00bfs Cutthroat `B\u00bf Gas Plant has coordinated with the Pleasant View Fire Department for emergency response procedures.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Cutthroat `B\u00bf Gas Plant is located approximately 17.5 miles southwest of the town of Pleasant View, Colorado.\n\nThe plant operates a low temperature, liquid separation process for the production of `Y Grade\u00bf natural gas liquids (NGLs).  These liquids are made of propanes, butanes and heavier hydrocarbons.  Additionally, dehydrated natural gas (methane and ethane) is produced at the facility.  All of these substances are regulated under the RMP program and considered a flammable mixture.  Questar has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 0.4 miles and qualifies for Program 1 due to the plant\u00bfs distance from any public receptors.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nCutthroat `B\u00bf Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five (5) years.  There have been no onsite or offsite accidents, as defined by EPA\u00bfs General Guidance on Risk Management Programs.  \n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\nThe Cutthroat `B\u00bf Gas Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of proce"

The procedures address the aspects of emergency response including first aid, evacuation plans and accounting for all personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency resonse agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident clean up requirements.\n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nQuestar employees receive training in these procedures as necessary.\n\nEmergency Response Plan is updated as needed."
