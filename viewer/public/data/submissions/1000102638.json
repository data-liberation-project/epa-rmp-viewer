The Lexington Volunteer Fire Department and the Dawson County Local Emergency Planning Commission will be invited to attend and/or be a part of the exercise or to meet for coordination of response activities.   \n\nChief 's Risk Management Program consists of an employee involved systems approach to risk reduction, risk management and risk removal.  Each of the goals of the safety process will be implemented and overseen by the Process Safety Management (PSM) Committee. This PSM Committee will be in charge of the monitoring process of the Process Safety Management system as well as the progress of the safety systems.\n\nThe PSM Committee will report all its activities and findings to members of the management team.  \n\nThe emergency response policy of Chief is as follows: We will depend on the Lexington Volunteer Fire Department for responding to all catastrophic fire events.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc., Lexington (Chief) is a fuel ethanol production facility.  The ethanol produced from this facility is made by processing corn to produce ethanol.  There are two corn storage bins and two hammer mills that grind corn for the process. There are fermentation tanks, chemical tanks, a denaturant tank, corrosion inhibitor tote, and ethanol storage tanks.  The chemical tanks consist of on 50% caustic soda tank, one sulfuric acid tank, one urea tank, and two enzyme tanks.  This facility loads ethanol into railroad tank cars and semi-truck tankers.   The facility produces byproducts that include wet distiller's grains, syrup, and corn oil.\n\nSome but not all of the mechanical safety systems are: a distillation deluge water fire suppression system (this system will completely deluge the distillation area 1500).  This facility contains a fire alarm system that uses heat sensing tape in the process as well as heat sensors mounted outside and elevated on different structures to cover distillation where the ethanol is of higher concentration in the system.  Fire hydrants are located through the facility that are connected to the city water system the Fire Department can utilize to respond to any fire location in the plant.\n\nThe production area is equipped with safety interlocks in the control system to prevent abnormal conditions including over pressurization, overflows, high temps, high voltage, low flow and high flow.  In the grain receiving, conveying, and milling areas the system is equipped with bearing temp sensors, speed switches, and rub blocks to watch for plugged or stalled operation or temperature deviations.  \n\nThere is also a fire alarm system that can be manually activated.  The fire alarm system itself requires data input to any alarm that has triggered before it can be reset.  The master panel to this alarm system is located in the operations room which has 24-hour occupancy when the production system is running.  This"
