The facility has three covered processes that use regulated chemicals above the applicability threshold: the organic monomer manufacturing process contains a diked allyl alcohol bulk storage tank (RMP toxic chemical); an organic peroxide manufacturing process contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical); and another organic peroxide manufacturing process utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management is committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n\n\n       Maintaining a staff of onsite safety professionals to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n\n       Providing a dedicated Safety Trainer for monthly employee training;\n\n       Supporting the facility's Behavioral Based Safety Management System; \n\n       Requiring facility to obtain American Chemistry Council?s Responsible Care RC 14001 Certification; an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security Management Systems that addresses various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n\n       Requiring facility to undergo periodic inte"

The Process Safety Management Standard, which is commonly referred to as PSM, requires subject facilities to perform specific accident prevention activities.  USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) also requires applicable facilities to develop an accident prevention program; RMP essentially adopted all of PSM accident prevention program requirements as RMP program requirements.  The accident prevention program requirements that Akzo Nobel has implemented include:\n\n\n\n     *   Conduct comprehensive process hazard analyses to identify potential causes of accidents\n\n     *   Develop and maintain detailed operating procedures for all processes\n\n     *   Provide comprehensive employee training on subject processes\n\n     *   Periodically verify, through non-destructive testing, the integrity of key process components\n\n     *   Develop Management of Change written procedure for reviewing proposed process changes\n\n     *   Conduct pre-startup reviews whenever any qualifying modification is made to the subject process\n\n     *   Conduct PSM and RMP compliance audits every 3 years\n\n     *   Conduct incident investigations whenever an incident could have resulted in a catastrophic release\n\n     *   Employee participation in conducting process hazards analyses\n\n     *   Ensuring contractors are fully trained and periodic review of their performances\n\n\n\nSeveral different managem"

A detailed written emergency response plan has been developed and addresses how we would promptly and efficiently respond to onsite emergencies.\n\n\n\nAll onsite Emergency Response Team members are trained in accordance with federal emergency response training requirements given at 29 CFR 1910.120; bi-monthly and annual emergency response training is conducted to maintain the overall readiness of the emergency response personnel and equipment.  The site conducts frequent real-time emergency drills with exercises involving simulated hazardous material releases.  Akzo Nobel is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) Association, and participates in an annual drill involving member CIMA companies.  Our site also undergoes periodic site inspections by CIMA to ensure our overall level of emergency response readiness.\n\n\n\nShould an emergency event ever occur onsite, the public would be informed of the event by a representative of Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals by placing a recorded message on the local Community Awareness Emergency Response line (281-476-CAER or 281-476-2237).  The person with overall responsibility for coordinating our response to an onsite emergency (Incident Commander) has the responsibility of ensuring that all agency and community notifications are promptly made.\n\n\n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nThe site has recently completed its triannual Compliance Audit and five-year Hazop Reviews of the affected Nouryset, Percarbonate, and MPP Plants.
