A&AT LLC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operated by A&AT LLC to produce a series of intermediate chemicals.  These chemicals, including; 1,4 Butanediol (BDO); Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Polytetramethylglocol (PTMEG) are produced then loaded onto trucks and railcars for distribution.      \n\n\n\nThe facility consists of two manufacturing areas designated as the THF and PTMEG Units.  The THF Unit uses formaldehyde, above the EPA designated Threshold Quantity, in its process.  Both BDO and THF are manufactured in the THF Unit following a chemical reaction resulting from the combination of  formaldehyde and acetylene.  \n\n\n\nAlthough the LaPorte Plant uses several EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals, formaldehyde is the only toxic chemical that is present in amounts above the EPA threshold quantity.  There are also no RMP regulated flammables in amounts greater than their threshold quantity used or stored at the LaPorte Plant.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency"

These high standards include:\n\n\n\n* Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n* Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n* Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n* Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe LaPorte Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n* Minimizing the possibility that combustion of \"chemical\" vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by replacement of the existing substation with a new state-of-the-art substation.  Additionally the facility has a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of a release through installation and testing of an SIS (Safety Instrumented System) to automatically shut down the process upon certain conditions. \n\n* Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n* Minimizing the possibility of a release of \"chemical\" by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\n\n* Reducing the severity of fires"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Texas State Police, and other coordinating agencies, and local hospitals.  The LaPorte Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been communicated to local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\n* The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n* The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n* The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize t"
