      "SummaryText": "A) Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders.\n\n\n\nB)  Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility; located 8 miles north and 2.5 miles east of Kit Carson Co.; incorporates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility handles methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, isopentane, pentane and butane which are regulated flammables.  The Facility processes approximately 10 million cubic feet of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\n\nC)  Five Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have not had an accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program/Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility.  Although processes at the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility are regulated by the U.S. EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, they are not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses only general safety issues and describes the man"

Examples of these include: lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is worked on, a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (e.g., hot work), a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nII)  Incident Investigation - The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire, explosion, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigator documents his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation teams' findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.\n\n\n\nIII) Compliance Audits - To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted approximately e"

The two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIV)  Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Feature, and Hazard Analysis Findings - The processes at the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations.\n\n\n\nA) Universal Prevention Activities - The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered processes at the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\n\n\nB)  Specialized Safety Features - The Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\ni)  Release Detection - Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms in all closed compressor buildings.\n\n\n\nii) Release Containment/Control - (1) Valves to permit isolation of the processes (manual or automated), (2) automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature, high pressure), (3) Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases, (4) atmospheric relief devices.\n\n\n\niii) Release Mitigation -  (1) Personal protective equipment, (2) trained emergency first responder personnel, (3) spacing of equipment in accordance with IRI spacing guideline, (4) emergency shutdown strategically placed in the plant to automatically shut in the inlet.\n\nEmergency Response Program - The Southeast Colorado Area maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for respondin"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are identified and affected personnel are informed of the changes.  The overall emergency response program for the Mount Pearl Gas Injection Facility is coordinated with the Kit Carson Fire Department and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) of Cheyenne County.  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.\n\n\n\nCertification:\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case release scenario for the following processes is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.  Within the past five years, the processes have not had any accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the processes, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, the public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact as indicated in the RMP.
