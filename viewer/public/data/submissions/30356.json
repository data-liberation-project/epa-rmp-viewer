      "SummaryText": "The Eramet Marieta Inc facility in Marietta, Ohio utilizes anhydrous sulfur dioxide (S02) and anhydrous ammonia (NH3) in the electrolytic manufacture of ferro-chrome alloys (ElChrome).  The ElChrome process has NH3 and S02 storage tanks.  There is one NH3 tank with a maximum capacity of 93,000 pounds and one S02 tank with a maximum capacity of 76,000 pounds.\n\nBecause sulfur dioxide and anhydrous ammonia are hazardous compounds as listed by the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the management of hazards in ElChrome is regulated by these agencies.  To comply with the regulatory requirements and to protect the health and safety of their employees, the surrounding community, and the surrounding environment, Eramet has established a risk management program to help ensure the continued safe operation of this process.\n\nIt is believed that the worst potential release from the System would be the collapse or rupture of the S02 tank.  Based opon the regulatory requirements, it was assumed that all the material in the tank would be released to the environment within 10 minutes.  Such a release has the potential to affect personnel with a 6.9 mile radius of the release site.  This area includes the residences of approximately 21,589 people, schools, recreation areas, hospitals, other industrial facilities, and the Ohio River.  However, this is an extremely unlikely situation.  The tanks are inspected routinely by Eramet personnel for damage.  They are equipped with relief valves that would relieve the pressure in the tank if it became excessive, thereby, preventing the rupture of the tank and the release of all the material in the tank.  A more likely release scenario would be a hole in a vessel rather than a vessel rupture, or a pipe break or hole in a pipe.  For a hole in an ammonia vesel, receptors within 0.47 miles may be affected.  This area includes the residences of approximately less than 50 people, other i"

This includes the residences of less than 50 people, other industrial facilities, and the Ohio River.\n\nEramet Marietta Inc. has established a management system intended to meet the requirements of both the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards to help ensure the safe operation of these processes.  To identify situations that have the potential to result in a sulfur dioxide or ammonia release, Eramet analyzed the process, looking at how elements interact, how the equipment can fail, practices that are in place to prevent failure, practices that are in place to react to failures, and what, if any, improvements need to be made.  In addition, Eramet has established facility-wide procedures to manage hazardous activities, such as welding, and process-specific procedures to address the hazards and operations and maintenance activities that are unique to the ElChrome process.  All personnel who may be equired to perform these acivitees are trained in the proper procedures.  Employees have been asked to participate in the developement of the procedures and other relevant documentation related to the process so their experiences and knowledge can be utilized.  New equipment is inspected and tested before it is placed in service, and all changes are analyzed before they are implemented to ensure they are implemented to ensure they do not create new hazards.\n\nEramet investigates every incident that occurs at the facility, whether or not S02 or ammonia is involved.  Eramet also has an emergency response program that includes personnel at the facility who have been treained in the best ways to handle releases and coordination with the Washington County LEPC.\nEramet is also a member of the Central Ohio Valley Industrial Emergency Organization (C.O.V.I.E.O.) that is a material assistance organization that lends needed materials during plant emergencies to neighbo"
