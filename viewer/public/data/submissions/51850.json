The complete PSM program ensures comprehensive coverage of process areas handling anhydrous ammonia and application of process safety controls.\n\nThe concept of Process Safety Management has its roots in solid management practices developed in various process industries. Management systems are a structured, systematic method to implement an identified set of activities with assigned responsibilities to achieve desired results. The management systems combine into a PSM program providing organization and application of Koch Foods of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama government and industry controls, policies, practices, and procedures.\n\nPSM Process and Facility Overview\n\nKoch Foods of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama operates an ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling.\n\nThe Koch Foods of Alabama, Montgomery, Alabama refrigeration system is designed to provide: operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations), economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required and alterative fuel 1 energy equipment),\noptimal safety performance (through minimal use of ammonia liquid pumps, utilizing instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant, detection systems, inspections and alarms) and consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThe facility had one accidental release in the past five years.
