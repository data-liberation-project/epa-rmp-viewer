Donnelly Drive\nHolland, MI  49424\n\n\n\n\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nRequest Foods' single facility is located in Holland, Michigan sitting on 20 acres of land in Holland Township.  Request Foods consistently employs 550 full time individuals on an annual basis in addition to utilizing a large temporary force during busier production seasons.  \n\nRequest Foods is a privately held, for profit, organization with the primary objective of producing high quality convenience frozen food entrees (mainly pasta and chicken based products) as well as side dishes for a large spectrum of nationally known companies.  The majority of its products are sold in both the retail and institutional market places.  Due to the frozen nature of the food products that are produced, Request Foods utilizes a series of coolers, spiral freezers and storage freezers to maintain the integrity of its products and raw materials.  The agent/chemical that is used at the facility to perform the cooling and freezing of the environment and products is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a substance regulated by the government.  The current maximum inventory of Anhydrous Ammonia at Request Foods is 140,000 pounds.  The majority of this inventory is considered \"in process\" cycling through the refrigeration equipment (compressors, evaporators, condensers, pumps, etc.).  There are 150 pieces of refrigeration equipment within the Ammonia system at Request Foods.  Presently, there are two large receivers located on the property, one on the southeast corner of the facility, and the second, on the east roof of the facility.  There are also, seven smaller receivers located within the facility in the engine rooms.\n\nAt Request Foods, management has taken every step necessary to provide a safe work environment for its team members and has been actively involved with the local Holland Township Fire Department and Ottawa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in k"

Request Foods complies with all OSHA, MIOSHA, DEQ and EPA regulations that pertain to the frozen food industry, employee's safety and health, as well as the community's safety and health.  Chemical safety is just one of the elements of the Request Foods safety program that it takes very seriously and vows to implement any, and all, safety related procedures as a means to comply with regulations and to ensure the safety of its employees and surrounding environment.\n\nSpecifically, Request Foods complies with the OSHA PSM standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119)) and utilizes the majority of the elements of the PSM program as the company's general accidental release prevention program detailing and outlining specific steps in the prevention of Ammonia spills.  As a result of Request Foods' compliance with the OSHA PSM standard, specifically the Process Hazards Analysis element of the program, Request Foods has been able to identify specific areas surrounding the Ammonia system that may require greater attention.  This has come in the form of requiring more stringent documentation of process equipment maintenance and preventative maintenance steps, bringing to the attention of contractors working on the system the required safety procedures, and emphasizing a greater breadth of awareness amongst the entire Request Foods employee population and training topics for the affected employees with their job responsibilities most closely associated with the Ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nShould there be a release of Ammonia from the Request Foods facility, estimates have been made with the assistance of the Holland Township Planning Office regarding the amount of off-site impact (human) there may be immediately around the facility given specific distances for worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.

Given the models equations, an endpoint, or vulnerability zone was calculated to be 1.50 miles in all directions from the center of the facility.  Assuming this worst-case scenario should happen, the estimated residential population within distance to the 1.50-mile endpoint is 10,883 individuals.  There is a major commercial, office and industrial area surrounding the Request Foods facility, which would increase the amount of human impact if such a release were to occur.  Beyond the immediate industrial and commercial population, as well as the residential population, there are schools, adult foster care centers and other public receptors within the 1.50-mile endpoint that would have been affected.  For this scenario of release, there are also no National or state parks, forests or monuments, no designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves or refuges, nor any Federal wilderness areas.  Control measures are in place, however, to prevent this type, or amount, of catastrophic release from occurring.   Request Foods has written operating procedures that thoroughly examine the normal daily operations as well as emergency operations of the ammonia system, which include numerous safeguards for preventing large releases.  As well, high-level ammonia alarms are present in the system which would prevent ammonia receivers from every being over 60% full which would decrease the potential of their being 27,000 pounds of liquid ammonia in a receiver at any one time down to 16,200 pounds.
