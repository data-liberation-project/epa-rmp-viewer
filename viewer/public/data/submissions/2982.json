The facility has an extensive Risk Mangagement Program that follows OSHA and EPA guidelines.  The program emphasizes employee training, emergency response, and equipment inspection/ maintenance.\n\nThe WWTP stores and utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide, both of which are regulated substances under this rule.  These substances are stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity on-site at any given time is 8000 lb. per substance.   Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used for the disinfection of treated wastewater prior to discharge.\n\nRMPcomp software was used to conduct the worst-case release scenario for chlorine.   Additionally, enclosures (e.g. buildings) were considered as passive mitigation measures in the analysis, which reduced the impact of a potential release.  The analysis calculated an impact radius of 0.9 miles.  This impact radius would result in an offsite impact (members of the pubic could be exposed to toxic concentrations). \n\nFor the alternative scenario, the same procedures and mitigation measures were used as listed above for the worst- case release scenario.  The scenario chosen for analysis was a hole in the liquid space of one of the storage cylinders.  The analysis showed an impact radius of 0.6 miles.  This impact radius would result in an off-site impact. \n\nThe WWTP's Risk Management Program covers all aspects of safely handling/storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  This program requires employees to routinely inspect and maintain all process equipment.  The program requires that employees receive training on all aspects of  process equipment to ensure a safe operating environment, and more importantly, to minimize the possibility of a release.\n\nThe WWTP has had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years. \n              \nThis facility does n"
