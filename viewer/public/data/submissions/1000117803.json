We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant located in Bloomfield, New Mexico at 895 County Road 7100, Bloomfield, New Mexico 87413.  \n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant consists of two cryogenic gas processing trains which process gas from the surrounding gas field and remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the raw field gas.  This is accomplished by changes in the temperature and pressure of the inlet natural gas stream which causes the liquids to condense out of the natural gas stream.  The condensed NGL is treated to remove Carbon Dioxide, dehydrated and then shipped via pipeline to Mont Belvieu Texas for fractionation.  The residue gas stream is re-compressed and shipped via pipeline to distribution by others.\n\nThe NGL Extraction Plant process is regulated by Federal OSHA 29"

We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design of the proposed process vessels. Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Chaco Cryogenic Plant are propane refrigerant and y-grade product.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Chaco Cryogenic Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Chaco Cryogenic Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire eyes\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n*Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n*Atmospheric relief devices. \n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notificatio"

      "SummaryText": "n of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Chaco Cryogenic Plant is coordinated with the Farmington Fire Department. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Chaco Cryogenic Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Chaco Cryogenic Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Chaco Cryogenic Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Chaco Cryogenic Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Chaco Cryogenic Plant.\n\n* No changes are planned."
