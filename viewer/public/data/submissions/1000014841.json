In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\nAg Service Inc is an ag wholesale business that sells fertilizers to dealers for resale for crop production by farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in the plant to be combined with water and phosphorus compounds for mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\nThe maximum amount that can be stored at our facility is 53000 lbs or approximately 12000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia. \nThe Worst Case Release Scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the entire storage tank in a gas release over 10 minutes.  The amount released would be 53000 lbs and would result in an end point of 1.63 miles and would effect a population of 2500.  The Fertilizer Institutes degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be a pipe release over 2 minutes.  The total amount released would be 11908 lbs and would result in an endpoint of .83 miles and would effect a population of 135.  The Fertilizer Institutes degadis model was used for the end point calculations.\nAccident Release Prevention Program:  The facility has complied with the Kansas Department of Agricultures Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and are inspected every year.  The plant has also done its best to comply with the ANSI K-61 published by the American National Standards Institute and the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Ammonia regulation, 29 CFR 1910.111.\nThe 5-year Accident History:  There has not been a reportable accident in the past 5 years.\nWe have implemented and have p"
