The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names; Aveeno Shave Gels, Rogaine Topical Foam, Neutrogena Sun Block Spray and Aveeno Sun Block Spray. These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane(#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Isopentane (#78-78-4), Propane (#74-98-6)].\n\n\n\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, less than 8 ounces in size, including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be 480-2,880 individual containers.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Mooresville Distribution Center started operations in April 2011. The site has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or know offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage during the five year period since opening.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario was performed based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. Based on the assumption that the entire contents of a cloud explodes (quantity based on weight of propellant of one palletized unit load of each) the calculated distance (in miles) to the one psi endpoint were calculated to be less than 0.05 miles (the worst case scenario was for Isobutane). The calculated distance does not extend beyond the site property line (thus no offsite receptors are impacted).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable materials within the facility, loc"

Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire. Emergency Response Plans and Procedures include a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\n\n\n\nSafety Risk Assessment\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting. At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events.\n\n"
