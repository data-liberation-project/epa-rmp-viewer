The South Plant facility maintains continual contact with the public through\r\nregular meetings of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP).  The CAP advises the facility\r\non the need, frequency, and effectiveness of public communications. \r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n     The best way to protect the public is by preventing accidents.  We use the\r\nProcess Safety Management process to identify and prevent chemical releases.  The\r\nPSM process drives continual improvement in process safety.\r\n     Offsite, the facility has been active in supporting (through donations, participation and membership) \r\nthe CCLEPC since its formation in 1987.  EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 caused \r\nus to examine, and plan for, incidents which are extremely unlikely.  As a result of this examination, the entire \r\nemergency response process has benefited.  \r\n     A CCLEPC initiative worthy of mention the filming of a public service video, \r\nwhich instructs the public how to shelter in place.  \r\n\r\nGeneral comments about chemical release scenarios included as a part of the RMP submission:\r\n     All release modeling included in this plan  was calculated using the latest EPA provided tool RMP \r\nComp.

Periodically, neighbors call and report odors.  \r\nThese reports are investigated and a serious attempt is made to determine the origin of the odor.  \r\nIf the odor is found to be originating at the West Plant, all efforts are made to mitigate the odor at the source.\r\n     \r\nFacility emergency response program:\r\n     Our emergency response plan is in the format developed by EPA.  This format is\r\ncommonly known as the One Plan.  This particular format was developed to address\r\nthe off site responder need for simplicity while complying with all regulatory\r\nrequirements.  \r\n     The emergency response program is based on the principle that the facility\r\nshould respond to incidents within the scope of the facility's expertise, while the local\r\nauthorities respond within the scope of the Columbia County Emergency Response\r\nPlan.  This means that the facility is responsible for preventing incidents before they\r\nhappen.  But if a incident does occur, the facility is responsible for mitigating the offsite\r\nconsequences of the incident by source control.  The Columbia County Department of\r\nEmergency Management is charged with implementing the Columbia County\r\nEmergency Plan and coordinating the response.  The Columbia County Emergency\r\nPlan was developed by the Columbia County Local Emergency Preparedness\r\nCommittee (CCLEPC) under the direction of the Columbia County Emergency\r\nResponse Director with the aid of the Columbia County Judge.\r\n     The West Plant Emergency Plan contains procedures for response to chemical\r\nreleases, fires, and natural disasters.

Sometimes, tasks involving welding, cutting, braising, or other\r\nflame or spark producing activities, must be performed in areas where flammable\r\nchemicals are present.  Hot work permits insure fire prevention and protection\r\nrequirements have been implemented prior to beginning the work.  Another essential\r\npart of the risk management program is the use of lock out/ tag out procedures. \r\nWhen a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all\r\nsources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may\r\nperform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work\r\nPermit to make assure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red\r\ntags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; and place a personal\r\nlocking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.  No employee can\r\nremove a red tag, actuate a tagged component, or remove a personal locking device\r\nplaced by another employee.  \r\n     We depend on contractors and contract employees for many essential services. \r\nUnder our PSM program, we insure that contractor preformed maintenance, repair, and\r\ngeneral operations are preformed safely.

For this reason, pre-start-up reviews are\r\nconducted with the aim of insuring that: design specifications are adequate and have\r\nbeen met; adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in\r\nplace; and that employee training is adequate and has been completed.\r\n     Many historical accidents may be traced to a seemingly minor or inconsequential\r\nprocess change.  We manage process changes through a system that insures the\r\nimpact of a change is assessed and appropriately addressed before the change is\r\nimplemented.  Part of this program (Management of Change) is communication of the\r\nchange and anticipated effects to all affected employees, and training provided as\r\nnecessary.\r\n     To assure compliance with this program, regular audits are conducted. \r\n     We make every effort to minimize risk through training, preparation, and\r\nplanning.  Yet an incident may occur.  When an incident occurs, an investigation is\r\nperformed to determine the root causes for the incident and to recommend corrective\r\naction to prevent a reoccurrence.  These investigations are performed on minor (even\r\ntrivial) incidents.  Lessons learned on trivial (no impact) and near miss incidents often\r\ncan often be used to teach us how to avoid more serious consequences. \r\nDocumentation of the investigation is maintained.  \r\n     The best source of information about process hazards is employees who work in\r\nan existing process.  Line employees are an integral part of our process of chemical\r\nhazard analysis.  Employee access to the results of PHAs and other aspects of the risk\r\nmanagement program is insured and encouraged.\r\n     We use a permit system to insure that all aspects of a job (non-routine) must be\r\nconsidered before performing that job.  Each process issues Safe Work Permits for non\r\nroutine jobs done in that area each day.  Permits generally expire at the end of a shift\r\nand are critical to commu"

For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the\r\nrequisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial\r\nhygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be\r\nused to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied\r\nto a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the\r\nprocess.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate\r\nthose hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\r\n     Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started\r\nup, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in\r\nSOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures,\r\noperation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process\r\nhazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is\r\nreviewed no less often than annually.\r\n     Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.  Each employee in an\r\noperating process receives job specific and general training on safety and health\r\nhazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  This training is administered\r\naccording to the needs of the employee and the specific requirements of the program.  \r\n     Preventative Maintenance (PM) is an integral part of our accidental release\r\nprevention program.  Our PM program addresses equipment and controls whose failure\r\ncould lead to injury, significant release, or property loss.  The program includes regular\r\ninspections and tests of process equipment consistent with manufacturer's\r\nrecommendations, good engineering practices, and field experience.

If a situation has impact beyond the\r\nborders of Columbia County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination\r\nwith adjoining counties and parishes.\r\n     All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release\r\nprevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training\r\neasier and coordination with local off site responders better.

Three chemicals in one\r\nprocess was found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention\r\nand emergency response programs are exactly the same for covered and non-covered\r\nprocesses; covered and non-covered chemicals are both subject to both programs.\r\n     The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to\r\nprovide continuity.

      "SummaryText": "About our Facility:\r\n     The West Plant Facility is located in rural Columbia County, about five miles west\r\nof Magnolia, Arkansas.  Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily\r\nagricultural, with silviculture and animal operations predominating.  The plant is located\r\non the south side of a low hill or ridge between two intermittent streams.\r\n     The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located\r\nabout 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of\r\nwells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into\r\nthe same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \r\n     The West Plant produces bromine and sodium hydrosulfide.\r\n\r\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n     The West Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and\r\nemergency response programs.  It is the policy of the West Plant Facility to reduce the\r\nrisk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk\r\nreduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM\r\nstandard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program\r\nfollowing the OSHA standard.  \r\n     The Policy of the West Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency\r\nsituations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations\r\nin a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan\r\nwhich follows EPA's One Plan concept.  West Plant personnel respond to\r\nemergencies on site with a trained fire brigade, HazMat responders, and a corps of\r\ntrained EMTs.  The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first\r\nresponders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure\r\nthrough the county-wide emergency plan.  \r\n     Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for off site impact, \r\nthe local County"
