Each of the elements of the OSHA PSM program including process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors have been implemented for prevention. Additionally, JX NCTI has developed a PSM team to monitor the PSM program for effectiveness and compliance and make appropriate recommendations. Additional prevention controls implemented in the ENB2 process include fire prevention and response equipment, and a highly trained Emergency Response Team.",

(JX NCTI) is committed to operating and maintaining all of its processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. JX NCTI uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that JX NCTI has designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and the storage and transfer of substances regulated by EPA RMP.\n\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n?    A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP\n\n?    An overview of the emergency response program\n\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, or the environment\n\n2 - STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nJX NCTI is a chemical manufacturing facility located in Harris County, Texas. The plant consists of reactors, distillation columns, storage tanks and shipping and receiving facilities for bulk tank trucks as well as rail cars. JX NCTI primarily manufactures chemicals used in the carbonless copy paper, electrical capacitors, heat transfer fluids, and EPDM rubber industries. Some by-products are produced and are sold as fuels and solvents.\n\nThe majority of the chemicals handled at JX NCTI are non-hazardous. However, JX NCTI does have three regulated flammable chemicals under the Risk Management Program. These three chemicals are 1,3 Butadiene (BD), Propylene, and Isobutylene. JX NCTI does not store or process any of the listed toxic chemicals.\n\nThese chemicals ha"

Offsite consequences were determined assuming maximum possible inventory even though the inventory of these chemicals is often reduced.\n\nJX NCTI's accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment in the storage, transfer, and processing of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nJX NCTI takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. JX NCTI's management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit procedure, emergency planning and response, and contractor safety.\n\nAs part of JX NCTI's prevention efforts, it has implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.    Pressurized tanks are equipped with a pressure relief device routed to a control device.\n\n2.    Storage tanks are equipped with pressure, temperature and level instrumentation.\n\n3.    Digital Control Systems (DCS) alarms linked to instrumentation are programmed for specific conditions. \n\n4.    Key parameters are continuously monitored in a central control room by highly trained DCS operators.\n\n5.    Systems are pressure and leak tested before chemicals are introduced.\n\n6.    Tanks are built and installed per ASME and NFPA Codes.\n\n7.    Automatic safety interlocks or emergency shutdowns are programmed into the DCS.\n\n8.    Area leak detectors are installed and monitored by DCS operators.\n\n9.    Storage tanks for BD and Propylene have fireproof insulation for passive protection in a fire event.\n\n10."

A rigorous Mechanical Integrity program that covers process equipment and piping.\n\nThese individual elements of JX NCTI's prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. \n\n4 - FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nJX NCTI maintains records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at its facility. There have been no RMP accidents in the past five years.\n\n5 - EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nJX NCTI maintains an emergency response and contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, JX NCTI is a member of a Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the CIMA organization. Elements of our emergency response plan that reduce the impact on the defined receptors include: Fire protection equipment, water curtain capabilities to minimize releases, alarm systems, trained responders, community alert system, and communication links to offsite responders.\n\n6 - PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe safety and environmental training program have been updated and improved and continues to improve. The Behavioral Based Safety Program has been revised, and observations submitted by all employees are continuously reviewe"
