The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the North Columbus Water Resource Facility (WRF).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nPrimary Activities\n\nWater treatment.\n\n\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are odor control and iron removal.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe North Columbus WRF is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR Part 68.  The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What-If\" analysis.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe North Columbus WRF has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite dispersion or property damage, or in injuries onsite.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe CWW has implemented an Emergency Response Program that applies to the North Columbus WRF, which coordinates response efforts with the local fire department's Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Georgia Emergency Management Office.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the North Columbus WRF has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe"

      "SummaryText": " operation of the chlorination system.  During the most recent hazard review, the hazard review team made the following recommendations for improving the safe operating procedures and for minimizing the likelihood of an offsite release from the chlorination system:\n\n\n\nNew Recommendations from the safety Inspection of the NCWRF on 5 June 2009: \n\n1. Require annual third party inspections of all ton cylinder hoists;\n\n2. Require The North plant, transition over to a post and yoke for ton cylinder attachment from a threaded pigtail.  \n\n3. Require all operators and managed maintenance should have training on the new CI pamphlet 155. \n\n4. Require all new operators a training session on operation of the hoists, who lift ton cylinders of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. \n\n5. Require sniff test of all ton chlorine cylinders valves being delivered and a log kept of defects to monitor quality of the chlorine cylinders.  \n\n\n\nThe below items have been completed after the June 21, 2004 submission:\n\n1. Require personnel entering the chlorine building to carry a mouth-bit escape respirator and chemical safety goggles while in the building;\n\n2. Require operators to complete crane operator training before transferring one-ton containers using the hoist system;\n\n3. Require hoist inspections that follow ANSI and OSHA guidelines;\n\n4. Require operators and maintenance employees to complete the Chlorine Institute Training Program, \"Safe Handling of Chlorine\";\n\n5. Install a protective rail and truck barrier posts to protect the manifold from swinging one-ton containers during unloading; and\n\n6. Require a hot work permit system for any cutting and welding inside the chlorine building."
