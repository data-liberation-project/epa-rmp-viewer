      "SummaryText": "Winchester Municipal Utilities Water Treatment Plant, located a 635 Water Works Road, Winchester, KY, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage is located outdoors.  The chlorination process is located inside the chlorine process building.  In the process room, the system has one (1) one-ton cylinder of chlorine on-line and one (1) one-ton cylinder of chlorine on standby at any one time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automatically shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe Facility has a chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorinator area.  A chlorine sensor is located at about twelve (12) inches above floor level.  The detector will automatically alarm at the Faciltiy and at the main control room panel.\n\nThe Facility normally stores a maximum of five (5) one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  All cylinders not in use are stored outdoors.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck via crane and placed upon the dock.\n\nNormally, the chlorinator room is secured with doors that remain closed and locked except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound.  The alarm has two detection levels.  A warning level of 3 parts per million (ppm) and high alarm level of 5 ppm.  If the alarm sounds, the Operator will notify the Plant Supervisor and appoint a Standby Operator.  If the warning alarm is indicated, the Operator and Standby will don the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the Operator will then investigate the cause for the alarm.  The Standby will remain outdoors in"
