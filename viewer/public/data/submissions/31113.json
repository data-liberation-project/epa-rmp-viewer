Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Western Iowa Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at our anhydrous ammonia facilities is storage for future sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for  direct application as crop production nutrients.  Propane is stored and delivered to member patrons for use in heating and grain drying.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored (85% of capacity) :\n\n                  Tank Size (gallons)                     Pounds at 85 % full\n\n                    25,000 gal.                                      109,438  lbs\nNurse Tanks  21 @ 1,000 gal                               91,927 lbs\nTotal             46,000 gal                                      201,365 lbs\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.  \n\n The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 109,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank(s) at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  \n The alternative release scenario based on the five-year history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nWestern Iowa Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., and the standard"

In addition, we comply with all applicable federal (EPA), state and local requirements.\n\nOur ammonia systems are protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, barriers, and manual and emergency shutoff valves.  All main storage and hose end valves are locked when not in use.  The systems are inspected on a regular basis with  maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges and relief valves are replaced when necessary and or according to the guildelines in the ANSI Standards.  If repair is done to valves or pumps, it is done by an outside professional contractor.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, and on the job trainig.  Topics covered in this trainig include; safety, operating procedure for plant startup, plant shutdowns, filling a nurse tank, unloading a transport, emergency shutdown and startup after emergency shutdown.\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nWestern Iowa Coop, Correctionvuille Location has had no accidental releases. \n\n6.The Emergency Response Program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to insure that they are familiar and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.  This will help to insure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigatinga the threat posed by an ammonia release.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process"
