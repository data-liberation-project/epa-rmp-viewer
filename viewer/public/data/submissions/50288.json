Since start up the Neches Terminal has continually improved safety practices and maintenance preventative/predictive programs.   The Neches Terminal requires operators to be trained and qualified in accordance with OSHA standards.\n\nAt the Neches Terminal anhydrous ammonia is stored at -27 degrees F. to minimize initial flashing in the event of a tank release.  Ammonia tanks were constructed in accordance with API-620 code, x-rayed and hydrostatically tested.  Emergency vents and relief valves are routed to a closed-loop system which is vented to the flare.  Extensive safety instrumentation is used on-site including alarms, interlocks and ammonia leak detectors. Tank pressures are monitored twenty-four hours each day, seven days a week by an off-site security system.  All safety critical equipment is periodically inspected to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  The ammonia flare is continuously monitored and video tape recorded using a fixed camera.  Storage tanks and loading facilities are equipped with automatic emergency block valves to minimize a release.  In addition, fire monitors are strategically placed to mitigate the effects of a release of ammonia.\n\nManagement ensures that all personnel have the required level of process knowledge and experience.  Work permits are used to control any hazardous work around the facility.  All incidents are fully investigated, and actions are taken to prevent recurrence.\n\nEmergency response personnel are trained under 29 CFR \u00bf Part 1910.156 requirements and quarterly emergency drills are conducted.  The Neches Terminal has a detailed emergency response plan that meets all 29 CFR requirements, and the Emergency Response Team operates under the Incident Command System.\n\nThe facility is equipped with an audible warning system with procedures in place to notify on-site personnel during an emergency.  In addition to"

      "SummaryText": "the audible warning system, the Neches Terminal continuously monitors weather conditions and utilizes predictive software so that potential impact zones can be predicted.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is base on the rupture of a 34,000 short ton, above ground, ammonia storage tank.  While EPA rules would not allow use of water for mitigation when calculation our worst-case scenario, we are of the opinion that our end point distance of 25 miles would be significantly reduced since our tank is near water.  The end point distance was concluded by using OCA guidance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is base upon the activation of a railcar pressure relief valve.  This scenario was selected due to the frequency of railcar loading operations.  The end point distance of 0.24 miles is based upon ALOHA and residential population would not be affected by this scenario.    \n\nIn summary, the Neches Terminal is committed to implementing controls necessary to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention and personnel training, as well as considering safety as one of the highest priorities in the installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes.  In the unlikely event that a release occurs, the Neches Terminal has trained operating personnel who will respond to control and contain the release."
