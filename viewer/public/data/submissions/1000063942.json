The Facility Policy\r\n\r\nThe owners, management, and employees of Bickett Farms LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Bremen Fire Dept.., Muhlenbery County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers, farm chemicals and related agricultural products, for sale to the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored would be 556,000 Lbs in our storage tank(s), consisting of 1-30,000 gal. 2x 12,000 gallon storage tanks and our nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the 1-30,000 gal. storage tank holding 140196 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario.\r\n\r\nWorse-Case:  The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or rail tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140196 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. Off site information is being withheld by request of DHS\r\n\r\nAlternative Case:  The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a 3 inch Diameter transfer hose.   Off site information is being withheld by request of DHS\r\n\r\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards, Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29"

The Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia (from our fixed sources) in the past five years that: have caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damages.\r\n\r\n6. The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has a current Emergency Action Plan ( in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38) in place and has coordinated this program with  Fire Chief of Bremen Fire Dept.. and with Muhlenberg County LEPC.  We train our staff on the elements found in our program (in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120) and have invited the fire department to visit our facility in order to provide them with a working knowledge of our plant's layout and our storage facility. \r\n\r\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\n\r\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
