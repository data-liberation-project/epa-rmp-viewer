We also Market Products and DBA Primavera and Prima Frutta. Our employees are trained to evaluate, evacuate, notify emergency responders if needed and take defensive mitigation actions without entering a hazardous area. A current detailed copy of RMP, and Prevention Program including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting Lawrence or Tim Sambado.\n \nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). Any accidental or authorized release of information in section 2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at A Sambado & Son, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass growing, packing, processing, storage and shipping of fresh produce.  We have 1 regulated substance above federal thresholds present at our facility.  The substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) NH3.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as refrigerant in a closed"

It's naturally occurring in our environment.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario are included in filing and only summarized here. External Events analysis was included in all PHA's and are typical for the cold storage and processing industry. \nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, alternative release scenario analysis we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp software.  The EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a reference.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel.  In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the largest High Pressure receiver #5.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. All liquid releases can be contained on-site. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release typical of a compressor shaft seal failure. In normal use compressor shaft seals indicate replacement is needed long before a release would occur.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The oldest part of the facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition and then applicable later building codes ass"

This includes updated and current P&ID's.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What if Checklist\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 yrs.. External Events Analysis are part of this study and include 12 typical for the industry and area. These include seismic, fire, sabatoge, loss of power, high temperatures and transportation accident.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was started on 01/30/2024 and took several months to complete.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A Sambado & Son, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is reviewed annually or if a change occurs and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are involved in operating processes, or doing inspections and simple PM activities are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Maintenance operations are carried out by a qualified refrigeration contractor or employees with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. We complete daily, periodic and annual inspections of all equipment. In addition we replace SRV's and do Mechanical Integrity Inspections at 5 year intervals. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at A Sambado & Son, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  We complete annual and 5 year reviews.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at A Sambado & Son, Inc..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

Implementation of the 2022 compliance audit recommendations and recent PHA revalidation recommendations will make our facility more regulatory compliant. Better documentation of testing and inspections, additional emergency ventilation, more labels and training are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes will be implemented over the next 24 months."
