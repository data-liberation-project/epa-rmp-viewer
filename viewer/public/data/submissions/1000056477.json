The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards.  The major components of the ammonia system are located in the mechanical room or just outside in alleyway.  The system is a one stage refrigeration cycle. Support operations include a maintenance shop, parts area, and administrative offices.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The operating capacity of each system exceeds this threshold.\n\n\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical A? Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facilityA?s PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facilityA?s plan.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is controlled and monitored 24/7 by the refrigeration personnel.  The system is equipped with fail safe devices, sensors, and pressure relief valves.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine "
