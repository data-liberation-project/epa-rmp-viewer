The Birchwood Power Facility has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instructions.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n        The process at the coal-fired electrical generation power plant subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction System used to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen generated from burning coal.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario: \n\n        Based on EPA criteria, the worst-case release scenario at the Birchwood Power Facility is the catastrophic failure of the 10,000 gallon ammonia storage tank.  This is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the Prevention Program.\n \n        The worst of the several alternative release scenarios considered for ammonia is a release of ammonia due to a liquid leak from a hole developed in the storage tank.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant designed to prevent this from occurring, however, for emergency response planning purposes they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\n        The accidental release prevention program at the Birchwood Power Facility is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.
