The Risk Management Program requires facilities that store certain substances above specific quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and minimize the possibility of serious harm to the public and the environment in the event of a release. This plan is referred to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nChlorine is stored at the Hastings Wastewater Treatment Plant in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which an RMP is required. This RMP document summarizes existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Hastings Plant has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases. To date, the plant has had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. No chlorine releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred at the Hastings Plant since the use of chlorine began.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Chemical Use at the Hastings Plant\n\nThe Hastings Plant is located at 100 Lea Street in Hastings, Minnesota near downtown Hastings and adjacent to a residential area. Wastewater from the city of Hastings is treated at the plant and discharged into the Mississippi River. The Hastings Plant treats approximately 1.75 million gallons per day using preliminary screening, primary settling and treatment, secondary treatment and clarification, and chlorination and dechlorination before final discharge. The plant has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from 1-ton chlorine containers.\n\nA chlorine vendor delivers the 1-ton chorine containers to the plant. Gaseous chlorine is withdrawn directly from the containers and delivered to the wastewater chlorination process area of the plant. The Hastings Plant uses state"

Modifications to the chlorine system will be reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the modification would compromise system safety. An effective change management system helps minimize the chance for an accidental release.\n\nIf a modification covered under RMP/PSM programs is made, its effects must be addressed, employees must be informed, and the written operating procedures must be updated. The intent is to require that all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing conditions other than replacement in kind be managed by identifying and reviewing them before implementation. A Management of Change Committee that consists of plant engineering, operations, and/or maintenance staff is formed to evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The committee will complete a Management of Change Form that must be reviewed and authorized prior to initiation of a covered change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, facility management will establish an investigation team. As part of the investigation, the investigation team will prepare an incident report to recommend system changes.\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded.

On the incident report form, the plant management identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation. The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe Hastings Plant is required to complete a triennial compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program. The primary goals of conducting an internal compliance audit are to gather sufficient data to verify compliance with RMP/PSM requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and to increase safety awareness among plant staff.\n\nThe compliance audit methodology is modeled after OSHA's guidelines for conducting regulatory PSM compliance audits: Compliance Guidelines and Enforcement Procedures, OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A (September 28, 1995). A team that includes at least one person knowledgeable in the covered \n\nprocesses and an audit leader knowledgeable in RMP/PSM requirements and audit techniques will conduct the audits. Plant management and the audit team will promptly determine an appropriate corrective action for each deficiency identified during the audit and document the corrective actions and the dates by which they must be taken. \n\nIn addition to the complete triennial audit, plant staff conducts an annual review of the RMP to assure correct information.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program develops a plan for dealing with a release.

Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Release Scenarios\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public surrounding the facility. The distance a set endpoint concentration of the chlorine gas would travel must be determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios- a worst case and an alternative case.  As required by the rules, the two scenarios were used to determine the possible affected area from chlorine release incidents at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe participation of the Hastings Plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff s experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n\nHastings Plant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops, as well as in preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below. All staff receive RMP/PSM awareness training that instruct them on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs. Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes are trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations req"

Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who work in the chlorine process area as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. Hastings Plant staff used this information to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance conducted the chlorine PHA, which was done using a combination of What-If' and Checklist methods. Based on \n\nthe results of the PHA, changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified. Several changes have been adopted by the plant and incorporated as part of the overall RMP/PSM program since becoming a regulated entity under the program. Program effectiveness is evaluated with each triennial audit and improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are initiated if necessary.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures for the chlorination process have been developed as part of the RPM/PSM plan.

When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the chlorine process is to be bid, the bidding procedures must ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a \n\n\ncontractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements must be conducted before work begins.\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RAP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely.\n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the RMP/PSM plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-startup Safety Review Form.

The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases. The non-chlorination period of November 1 through March 31 allows plant personnel ample time to assure integrity of the equipment and materials used in the chlorination system. \n\nThe Hastings Plant maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The staff that perform maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations. The process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace.

They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The Metropolitan Council's Hastings Wastewater Treatment Plant stores chemicals that it uses in its daily operations. The facility currently uses chlorine for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to discharge into the Mississippi River and stores the chlorine on-site in up to three 1-ton containers. \n\nIn common practice, chlorine and several chlorine compounds are used to purify drinking water, disinfect swimming pools and protect human health through the destruction of disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children who die daily could be saved through the use of an effective water disinfection agent such as chlorine.   Chlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable. However, it does support combustion under some circumstances. Chlorine is a respiratory irritant, and if accidentally released into the environment, exposure through inhalation or through eye or skin contact can pose a health risk. As a precaution, the Hastings Plant has special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine storage and use system.\n\nThe Metropolitan Council takes the safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we do providing the environment with safe disinfected water. The following document describes the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of chlorine stored on site, and what to do in event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, codified under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part"

Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP/PSM plan.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment/Release Scenarios\n\nA Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public surrounding the facility. The distance a set endpoint concentration of the chlorine gas would travel must be determined. In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios- a worst case and an alternative case.  As required by the rules, the two scenarios were used to determine the possible affected area from chlorine release incidents at the plant.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe participation of the Hastings Plant staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff s experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n\nHastings Plant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops, as well as in preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below. All staff receive RMP/PSM awareness training that instruct them on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs.

For example, chlorine leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination room. Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant as well as a red flashing warning light in the storage area. The alarms also sound at the central and local control panels. The leak alarms are tested weekly.\n\nOther system alarms include low vacuum at the chlorinator and low injector water pressure. These alarms sound at the chlorine central and local control panels. Vacuum regulators are mounted directly on the 1-ton chlorine containers so that all gaseous chlorine piping operates under vacuum. If a leak were to occur in the gas piping, outside air would be drawn into the piping rather than chlorine gas being forced out of the piping.\n\nThe 1-ton container storage area and chlorination room is enclosed in a building. Both areas are equipped with an automatic ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects chlorine while the room is occupied. Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided along with smoke alarms.\n\nThe Hastings Plant's water discharge permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) only requires disinfection from April 1 through October 31. During the rest of the year chlorine usage is significantly reduced and a complete preventative maintenance program is administered on all chlorine piping and equipment.\n\nRMP Requirements\n\nThe RMP consists of three major parts.

Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who work in the chlorine process area as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program. All the required process safety information was compiled as stated in the RMP regulations. The information meets and in many cases exceeds the minimum required by the regulations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) was conducted systematically to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases. Hastings Plant staff used this information to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance conducted the chlorine PHA, which was done using a combination of What-If' and Checklist methods. Based on \n\nthe results of the PHA, changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified.

When a contract involving work on or adjacent to the chlorine process is to be bid, the bidding procedures must ensure that contractor safety management requirements are met. If a \n\n\ncontractor is to work in or adjacent to any hazardous chemical, a safety briefing, to make the contractor aware of the plant's RMP/PSM plan requirements must be conducted before work begins.\n\nPre-startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new process that uses a regulated substance under RAP, or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely.\n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the RMP/PSM plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-startup Safety Review Form. This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed.

The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases. The non-chlorination period of November 1 through March 31 allows plant personnel ample time to assure integrity of the equipment and materials used in the chlorination system. \n\nThe Hastings Plant maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The staff that perform maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing hot work in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.
