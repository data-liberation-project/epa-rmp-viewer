This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\n    The Crown refinery, located in Pasadena, Texas , operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery grade propylene, gasoline, fuel oil, and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethanes, propanes, butanes, and pentanes.  In addition, the refinery uses chlorine for algae control in cooling towers  and hydrogen fluoride in the making of gasoline, which are also regulated substances.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\n    EPA has tailored the requirements of the worst case scenario (WCS) assessment into three tiers and Crown's risk management program falls into Program 3, because of its industry type - refining, and its existing coverage under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management program.  Crown's  WCS assessment associated with toxic substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a catastrophic failure of the hydrofluoric (HF) acid storage drum , resulting in a release of 50,000 pounds of HF gas from its storage drum over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls, such as water sprays, hydrogen fluoride detectors, hydrocarbon detectors, and hydrogen fluoride sensitive paint,  to prevent or warn of such releases and to ma"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint, which is the level of severity of a toxic release below which no harm should come to the community, for this WCS is 6.8 miles as calculated by the EPA's RMP*Comp?.\n\n  \n\n    The alternative release scenario (ARS) for HF is the failure of a pump seal in the Alkylation Unit, resulting in a release of less than 3.0 pounds of HF gas over a 1-minute period.  The 1-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for monitors to detect HF and for the isolation valves to isolate the pump and stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles as calculated by EPA's RMP*Comp?.\n\n  \n\n    The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal butane.  We do not limit the storage inventory in the tank and therefore, the WCS assumes the full tank inventory of 2,900,000 pounds is released, completely vaporizes, and ignites, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-PSI (pounds per square inch) endpoint for this WCS is 1.1 miles as calculated by EPA's RMP*Comp?.  This 1-PSI endpoint is the point from American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 752 that partial demolition of houses can be expected.  Although we have numerous controls, such as dikes, mechanical inspections, water spargers, and visual inspection every four hours, to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n    The alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of 61,000 po"

The maximum distance to the 1-PSI endpoint for this event is 0.2 miles as calculated by EPA's RMP*Comp?.  This event was selected as a more likely scenario than a WCS and therefore is used in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\n    The alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine at the refinery is a tubing leak from a 1 ton cylinder.  The leak could last for 2-4 hours between operator field checks and would emit up to 9.0 pounds per minute.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligrams per liter for this ARS is 0.1 miles.  A WCS for chlorine is not provided because EPA has asked companies to prepare one WCS for all regulated toxic substances, selecting the substance with the highest potential for off-site consequences, as long as the same public receptors would be affected.  This WCS is addressed above for HF.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n    The Crown  refinery has a good record of accident prevention over the past 5 years.  None of the six incidents that have occurred have resulted in offsite consequences.  Over the last five years Crown has had five Hydrogen Fluoride incidents and one flammables incident.  Each of the events consists solely of an injury recordable on the refinery's OSHA 200 Log for chemicals and flammable substances subject to the RMP program.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n    All of the hydrogen fluoride incidents consisted of no more than 2-4 drops of acid coming into contact with an employee.

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\n    Crown encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\n    Crown maintains and updates a variety of technical documents that are used to  ensure safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters, such as , temperature, level, and composition, in its Unit Operating Procedures manuals.

Any time that changes or updates are made to the process safety information, all such employees are informed and familiarized.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\n    Crown has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\n    Crown's refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations, which is part of the OSHA Process Hazard Analysis program.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Crown's refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\n    Crown's refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown,\n\n(5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the emergency operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 2 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\n    The refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that any change is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\n    The Crown refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
