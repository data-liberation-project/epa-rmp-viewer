      "SummaryText": "Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nITW Dymon operates an industrial/institutional maintenance product manufacturing facility in Olathe, Kansas. The facility is located on the south side of East Old 56 Highway, approximately ??A? mile west of Interstate 35. The business involves blending chemical raw materials at ambient temperature and pressure to produce maintenance and cleaning products for commercial distribution. Some of the manufactured products are packaged in hand held aerosol spray containers. ITW Dymon stores isobutane gas for use as propellant. The horizontal storage aboveground pressure vessel (APV), referred to as A-49, is located southwest of the main facility structure. The propellant storage and charging equipment constitute a Program Level 3 process for purposes of complying with the RMP regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition to the propellant storage and charging process, ITW Dymon also has a warehouse area which is dedicated to storage of aerosol products. This is a specially caged area (with ceiling to floor chain link fence) along the facility main building's southeast corner. This area stores only hand held aerosol spray cans, the largest of which contains approximately 1.5 pounds of propellant and product. The finished aerosol product storage area constitutes a Program Level 1 process for purposes of complying with the RMP regulatory requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\nITW Dymon is committed to maintaining our propellant storage and charging equipment in safe condition, and to providing our personnel with training in safe operating practices.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Release Prevention \n\nITW Dymon employees, including the Safety Team and Plant Maintenance Manager, are dedicated to maintaining the propellant storage and charging system in a safe manner. There are clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to the aspects "

      "SummaryText": "of the release prevention program, with specific responsibilities assigned to the Environmental/Regulatory Supervisor, Maintenance Manager, Human Resource Manager, Plant Manager and General Manager.  In association with the facilitys gas supplier, Technical Propellants, Inc., ITW Dymon maintains current safety information on isobutane, and propellant charging equipment, and reviews potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and potential use of the propellants at the facility.  ITW Dymon trains operating and maintenance personnel in procedures and safe practices. New employees are trained before being allowed to work alone and periodic refresher training is provided to all employees. ITW Dymon employs advanced technology, such as the MSA Ultima Gas Detection System (linked to an automated gas evacuation/equipment shut down relay), and the Fenwal Explosion Suppression System.  If significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of propellant, affected employees are retrained. ITW Dymon inspects and audits the regulated process, using both in house staff and trained professionals from outside the company. \n \n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release of isobutane from the facility which resulted in evacuation, sheltering in place, adverse health effects to employees or to the public, or damage to property.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBecause isobutane is a flammable substance above EPA's CAA Risk Management Program threshold quantity, the ITW Dymon Olathe facility is required to 1) develop an emergency response program including a written emergency response plan; or 2) coordinate response actions with the Olathe, Kansas Fire Department.\n\nThe Olathe facility employees are not qualified to respond to an uncontrolled or catastrophic release of isobutane.  The Olathe Fire Department has a fully staffed facility approximately 1/8 mile west of ITW Dymon.  ITW Dymon has n"

Presently, there are no specific plans to improve safety to the regulated process other than anticipated replacements-in-kind that are mandated by Code.  ITW Dymon will also conduct management review of program audit recommendations as they are received and make appropriate cost/risk effective safety improvements.    \n"
