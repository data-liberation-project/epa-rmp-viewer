Arkansas Eastman is a manufacturer of specialty organic chemical intermediates that are used by Eastman's customers in a variety of consumer products ranging from paints and coatings, to prescription medicines, to household detergents.  Arkansas Eastman has RMP regulated flammables consisting of acetaldehyde, ethyl mercaptan, and propylene.  In addition, the facility uses chlorine, crotonaldehyde, oleum (20% and 30%), anhydrous hydrogen chloride and formaldehyde, which are RMP regulated toxic substances. \n\nArkansas Eastman has a long-standing history of protecting the health and safety of employees, the community, and the environment.  This is evidenced through over 20 years of safe operations and excellent environmental stewardship, through our commitment to the principles of Responsible Care\u00ae, and through our recognition by OSHA as a \"STAR\" site in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  To protect people, property, and the environment, we use multiple systems-or layers of protection-where one system is designed to backup another system.  The first layer involves accident prevention by identifying and reducing risks during the design and before startup of new manufacturing processes.  The second layer involves operating and mantaining equipment and processes in a manner that reduces risks and minimizes incidents.  The third layer involves maintaining the capability to respond to and control incidents in a timely manner.\n \nHazard Assessment Results\nAll covered processes at Arkansas Eastman are regulated as Program 3.\n\nThe worst case scenario associated with the release of a flammable substance at Arkansas Eastman is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full storage tank of propylene (1-propene).

There are no off-site consequences associated with this scenario. To reduce the potential for an incident, several layers of protection are in place to minimize the effects of both the worst case and alternative case propylene scenarios.  These layers of protection include: 1) a water deluge system that provides fire protection for the unloading station and storage tanks, 2) an emergency shutdown switch in the control room, and 3) sensors to detect any leaks. \n\nThe worst case scenario associated with toxic substance processes at Arkansas Eastman is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a railcar of chlorine.  There are numerous controls in place that minimize the potential for such an incident and also to manage consequences if one should occur.  However, no credit for these controls is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  When such controls are not considered, the effects of this scenario could have an off-site impact based on EPAs OCA Guidence (RMP Comp Ver 1.06).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a failure of the one-inch discharge line between the emergency discharge shutdown valve and the chlorine vaporizer that supplies the production facility. There are no off-site consequences associated with this scenario. Several layers of protection are in place to reduce the potential for and to minimize the effects of both the worst case and alternate case chlorine scenarios.  Some of these layers of protection include: 1) perimeter sensors around the chlorine unloading station which activate alarms and emergency shutoffs, 2) a special discharge shutoff valve that limits the total amount of chlorine released, 3) excess flow valves that stop flow in case of a broken line, 4)"

Employees participate as members the Safety Key Result Area Team or one of its several subteams.  The Safety KRA Team is part of Arkansas Eastman's Total Quality Management Process.  The purpose of the team is to assess and ensure that the company's safety processes and initiatives support its vision of a work place free of unsafe acts, behaviors and conditions.\n\nArkansas Eastman encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to extensive information created as part of Arkansas Eastman's accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, Arkansas Eastman has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a program entitled \"Employee Development System for Safety\".  Each employee works with his immediate supervisor to determine individual and specific opportunities for improving safety performance.  Another initiative is Arkansas Eastman's Safety Concerns Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.

The VPP lists guidelines for employee participation.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\nArkansas Eastman keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information.  This information is normally compiled in a Process Safety Information (PSI) binder. The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nArkansas Eastman has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\nArkansas Eastman uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at Arkansas Eastman.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on the relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA Team.  These rankings help ensure  accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\nAll processes under"

These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change Process.  Department Superintendents certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\nTraining\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, Arkansas Eastman has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator apprentice program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they may work independently.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\nArkansas Eastman uses contractors to supplement its construction, maintenance and related services workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Arkansas Eastman has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.
