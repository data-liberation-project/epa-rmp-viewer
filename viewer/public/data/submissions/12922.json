Oil & Refining Co. is an independent petroleum refiner located on 136 acres in the Port of Tacoma with the facilities and personnel to process 43000 barrels per day of crude oil into products.  The facilities include over 2 million barrels of storage capacity for crude oil feedstocks, intermediate and finished products from volatiles such as liquid butane and gasolines, through distillates such as turbine aviation fuels, diesel and catalytic cracker feedstock, to heavy residuals and byproducts such as fuel oils, asphalts and liquid sulfur respectively. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes chlorine, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances, but below the threshold quantities covered by RMP.  The refinery has operated in this location for over 40 years and has evolved with the industry to a complex, yet safe, clean and efficient facility with 150 employees.\n\n    U. S. Oil & Refining Co. revised its risk management policies to conform with OSHA 1910 Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements several years ago when the regulations were enacted and now is incorporating the Clean Air Act Section 112 [r] Accidental Release Prevention requirements in this document.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) conveys to the community, the safety policies already in place within the refinery as well as the inherent hazards associated with handling petroleum products.  The PSM policy contains specific elements which are followed at the refinery to reduce risk of process related accidents.  During the past 5 years no listed chemical at this facility has threatened the community as described in the RMP guidelines.\n\nFor RMP communication purposes with the community, the facility is considered one process, which upgrades crude oil to refined products.  Under PSM requirements, the many process"

      "SummaryText": " areas within the refinery are each addressed separately.  The process areas include atmospheric and vacuum distillation or fractionation, catalytic reforming, isomerization, hydroprocessing, amine treating, sulfur recovery, utilities and off sites.  The latter includes tankage or storage of crude feed and refined products, which contain much larger volumes than the process areas and so yield the bulk of threshold quantities of regulated substances which RMP addresses.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n    \n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n    No regulated toxic substance releases meeting the threshold quantity criteria for the RMP guidelines can occur at this facility because of low inventory storage levels on site.  The RMP mandated worst case scenario (WCS) for regulated flammables at this facility is used as a planning tool.  It should be understood to be extremely unlikely to occur, both in probability and magnitude.  The facility's two pressurized butane storage vessels are remotely located from the refining process, in the off sites area away from ignition sources and other hydrocarbons.  They contain up to 2000 barrels of primarily liquid butane with minor amounts of propane and pentane.  Excess flow protection devices at the vessel nozzles connect them to the piping network, which is used for liquid transfer in and out of the vessels.  The nearest processing facilities are used to load butane into railcars.  Pressure relief valves on the storage vessels "

      "SummaryText": "set at the 125 psig design vessel pressure protect them in case of overpressure, by relieving vapor from the upper section of the vessel to the atmosphere.  This would reduce both the pressure and temperature of the vessel contents, due to auto-refrigeration of vaporizing liquid.  \n\nNormal operating pressure in the butane storage vessels is 25 psig.  The vessels were designed and constructed per the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) code for 125 psig. The calculated pressure whereby structural failure could occur is over 500 psig.  The internal liquid level and pressure is continuously monitored by the refinery's data collection computer system and annunciates an audible alarm to the operator in the central control room if abnormal conditions exist.  The area operator is in constant communication with the central control room operator by radio.  When requested, the area operator visually confirms discrete local instruments to verify if abnormal condition exists or if an instrument is malfunctioning, and follows procedures to rectify problems.  \n\n    The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of one of these storage tanks containing butane.  Administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tanks to 432,000 lbs. each, which is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.61 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  In the RMP specified worst case scenario, the liquid butane which would spill on the surrounding ground, could not normally all vaporize within 10 minutes, due to the large heat input required for vaporization.  Simple calculations show that the amount of ground and air that the boiling liqui"

Instead, ignition probably would be slower, or the VCE would include a lesser quantity, so the consequences would not reach as far as the RMP specified worst case scenario.\n\n    \n    The alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the full inventory release of butane from a railcar connected to the process.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.43 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\nA 1 psi overpressure wave is the limit that the RMP guideline determined creates significant damage.  Enough force to knock individuals off their feet, window breakage and minor structural damage occurs, but generally not lethal injuries.  There are exceptions and glass can break at greater distances than the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.  The circles that enclose the WCS and the ARS affects neighboring industries and businesses, but no residences.\n\n    The probability of a catastrophic failure of a storage containment vessel is extremely unlikely, because of U. S. Oil & Refining Co.'s PSM preventative practices, which is described in more detail later.  All pressure vessels at the facility are regularly inspected with industry proven Non Destructive Examination (NDE) methods appropriate for the given service.  The butane storage vessels were internally inspected in 1998 visually, ultrasonically, and with a fluorescent wet magnetic particle apparatus.  No problems were found and no repairs were required.  Every two years they are reinspected by U.S. Oil & Refining Co.'s National Board accredited inspection agency and issued an operating certificate by the local governing jurisdiction, the City of Tacoma.

No accidents involving off site effects or on site OSHA reportable events with RMP listed substances have occurred.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n    The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at U.S. Oil & Refining Co.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    The refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. has used both the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and the what/if checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  Both methods are recognized as systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n    The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually updated to be current and accurate.  The procedures are also maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n    In addition, U.S. Oil & Refining Co. maintains operating manuals that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely per"

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\n    U.S. Oil & Refining Co. uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.
