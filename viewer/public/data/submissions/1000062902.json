California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Lone Star Dehydrator has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities.\n\n \n\n1.1    LONE STAR DEHYDRATOR, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Lone Star Dehydrator has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide | 14,000 lb\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nLone Star Dehydrator has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1.    Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as wel"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Lone Star Dehydrator employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide chambers utilize sulfur dioxide gas to preserve the fruit color during the drying process. Sulfur dioxide is piped from a ton-container to each chamber using hose, PVC pipe, and valves. When in use, each chamber receives 30-lb of sulfur dioxide gas and then remains sealed for 7-hr afterwards.  \n\n\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of sulfur dioxide in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nLone Star Dehydrator has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n\n\n1.3.3    SULFUR-DIOXIDE\n\nThe sulfur-dioxide process at the Lone Star Dehydrator facility is an integral part of overall business and lasts for approximately five months out of the year. The sulfur-dioxide process contains multiple cylinders with a maximum inventory of 8,000lbs. It is extremely important that these areas and associated injection processes are maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Lone Star Dehydrator is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of exposure to sulfur-dioxide.\n\n\n\nOur personnel also monitor the sulfu"

In addition, the process is checked frequently during the season by the outside contractor that supplies the SO2 cylinders. The contractor also assists in performing the annual mechanical integrity review of our process equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLone Star Dehydrator has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\n\nLone Star Dehydrator's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n?    California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\n?    Federal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Lone Star Dehydrator continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Lone Star Dehydrator's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Lone Star Dehydrator's management team can"

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Lone Star Dehydrator has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Lone Star Dehydrator now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Lone Star Dehydrator employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Lone Star Dehydrator will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n\n"
