As Employees of Augusta-Richmond County Utilities Department, we have the responsibility to manage\n    the operations to protect human health and the environment.\n\nIn recognition of this responsibility, we will correct all unsound health, safety, and environmental practices or conditions as soon as they are identified.  We will:\n\n....conduct our operations in compliance with all state and federal laws & regulations.\n....Conduct periodic assessments of our operations to ensure compliance and risks reductions.\n....Provide education and training regarding laws, regulations, policies, and procedures to protect human \n    health and the environment.\n....Cooperate with our trade groups, governmental agencies, and others to develop effective,\n    reasonable rules and regulations to protect human health and the environment.\n\n2.  Our goal is to provide a safe and dependable supply of potable water that meets all state and federal\n     regulations while protecting human health and the environment.\n\n     Our water supply comes from twenty-eight wells and is treated in two plants.  Water enters into Plant#2\n     where it passes through an aerator and into a mixing basin.  Lime is added to adjust the pH and the \n     alkalinity of the water.  Then the water is treated with a phosphate for corrosion control and then finally\n     CHLORINE is added as a disinfecting agent.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario for chlorine would be the relaese of a full cylinder (2000 pounds) in \n     10 minutes that would have a distance of 0.9 miles toxic endpoint.  This distance was determined\n     by the use of EPA's RMP*Comp software.\n\n      The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)  for chlorine would be the shearing off of the valve and \n     releasing 2000 pounds in 15 minutes. The distance to the toxic endpoint would be 0.2 miles as\n     determined by EPA's RMP*Comp software.\n\n4.  The #2 Treatment Plant has had no reportable releases of Chlorine (3ppm) in the last five years.\n\n5.      EMERGENCY RES"
