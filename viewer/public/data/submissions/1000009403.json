Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Repackaging, Storage & Distribution.  We have three regulated substances present at our facility.  The substances are Formaldehyde 37% Solution, Aqueous Ammonia 30%, and Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%. \n\nListed below are the ways the three RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventories present at any one time.\n\n1. Formaldehyde 37% is received in 55 gal drums and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. \n\n2. Aqueous Ammonia 30% is packaged and stored in 55 gal and 330 gal containers in our warehouse for distribution to our end use customers.  \n\n3. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release of Formaldehyde 37%, Aqueous Ammonia 30% or Hydrofluoric Acid 70% has occurred during this period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT\n\nThe undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\nName:\t\t_____________________________"
