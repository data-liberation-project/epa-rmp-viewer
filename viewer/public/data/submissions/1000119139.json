The RMP regulated process is limited to the on-site Butane gasoline loading rack and tank batch blending process consisting of one pressure vessel, an offload station (truck), pump, piping and associated appurtenances. \n\nThe Pasco Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining the Butane Blending process in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Tesoro believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand-in-hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance. \n\nThe Pasco Terminal Butane Blending process is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Tesoro promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Tesoro and the Pasco Terminal have designed and implemented, including: \n\nA. A description of the facility/stationary source and its use of regulated substances (n-Butane); B. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs (Program Level 3); \nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals; \nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and \nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety. \n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe Butane Blending process has been classified as Program Level 3. No Program 1 or 2 processes containing regulated substances in excess of their respective threshold quantities are identified. By virtue of the flam"

Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which Butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the Pasco Terminal's safety policies and procedures. \n\nThe facility maintains fixed inventories of Butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) approximate 60,000-gallon (water capacity) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied Butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The Butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into rack gasoline fill lines or batch blended into gasoline tank receipts. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, fusible/low-melting point element \n(<250 degrees Fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (designed to fail-safe), automatic fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, pipe thermal/hydrostatic pressure reliefs, and various pressure/temperature/flow related alarms. Access to the Pasco Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and approved contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Pasco Terminal's accidental release prevention and emergency planning/ response programs help effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substances to facility employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard\n29CFR 1910.119.

The Pasco Terminal's employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the facility also has specific prevention measures that are\nemployed as part of its operating procedures and engineering/administrative controls to help quickly detect, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and corporate standards (ex. NFPA 58); \n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.); \n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained personnel along with 24/7 remote monitoring; \n-Redundant automated control systems and system UPS; \n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems; \n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, butane-containing components, and safety devices; \n-Secured facility access; \n-Regular safety meetings and awareness programs; \n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and \n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators. \n\nGeneral Release Mitigation \n\n-Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release qua"

In addition to the presence of appropriate release prevention controls, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility with response activities being coordinated with the City of Pasco Fire Department and Franklin County Emergency Management. \n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe Pasco Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal maintains records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. As this is a new process, there have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials defined under the EPA RMP Rule. \n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Pasco Terminal is identified as a Non-Responding Stationary Source and, as such, utilizes outside sources (City of Pasco Fire Department) for offensive-type response actions. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending process, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the City of Pasco Fire Department to request their assistance"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nTesoro is continually striving to make the Pasco Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.  In an effort to improve and promote system safety, Tesoro looks for, and actively seeks employee input, on process safety improvements per its Employee Participation program. All process safety events (as defined in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed and/or investigated via root-cause analysis (ex. TapRooT) per corporate policy. Additionally, the Pasco Terminal works cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."
