              "Description": "The Ethylene Unit manufactures ethylene from crude ethane.  The unit includes the process unit itself as well as tankage located in the 529 Tank farm as well as near the Barge Docks (e.g. Mixed C4 Hydrocarbon Tanks- Flammable Mixture, HAD, LAD).  The process unit generates Charge Gas, which is a stream that contains numerous RMP-regulated substances.  Chlorine cylinders are located near the Ethylene cooling towers.  The Ethylene Unit's prevention program adheres to the requirements of applicable Corporate standards.  These standards include the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.",

SRO adheres to corporate policies, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n\n\n- All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable.\n\n- The Goal is Zero.  Zero injuries and zero incidents.\n\n\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health and Environmental and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  In addition, at SRO, related policies are implemented through the site Safety, Health and Environmental Manual and Process Safety Management Manual.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nSRO is located approximately 2 miles south of the city of Orange, in a rural setting on FM 1006.  The site is located on 1500 acres evenly divided between manufacturing processes, former employee recreation areas, and bio-oxidation ponds.  A chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24-hour security force secure the facility.\n\n\n\nThe site manufactures Ethylene and Ethylene Copolymers.  Support operations include Site Environmental Services (i.e. incinerator) and Power.  The barge dock, water treatment/biopond operations, and cogeneration operations are included in the Power Unit.\n\n\n\nWithin these operations, the following regulated substances are used and are present on site in quantities greater than thier TPQ:\n\n\n\n- Vinyl Acetate monomer (VA)\n\n- Ammonia, Aq (>20%)\n\n- Chlorine\n\n- Ethane\n\n- Ethylene\n\n- Propane\n\n- Propylene\n\n- Isoprene\n\n- Hydrogen\n\n- Methane\n\n- Flammable Mixture of:\n\n      1,3-Butadiene\n\n       Butane\n\n      1-Butene\n\n      2-Butene-cis\n\n      2-Butene-trans\n\n      1-Pentene\n\n      Isobutane\n\n      Isobutylene\n\n\n\nIsoprene is found in a by-product HAD.
