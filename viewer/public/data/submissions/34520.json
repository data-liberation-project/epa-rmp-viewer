The specified threshold quantity for flammable substances under the RMP Rule is 10,000 pounds. \n\nHazard Assessment:  Worst-Case Release Scenario\nA required element of a Risk Management Program is a hazard assessment using a worst-case release scenario to determine distance (endpoint distance) to affected public and environmental receptors. The hazard assessment is also referred to as the off-site consequence analysis. Despite the RMP Rule's focus on a worst-case release scenario, the probability that such a scenario will occur is extremely unlikely; therefore, this scenario represents a useful planning tool.  By no means does it indicate the probability of such an occurrence.  In the case of flammable substances, the RMP Rule defines worst-case release scenario as a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) generated by the release and ignition of the contents of the single largest vessel in a process.  In addition, no existing safety, accident prevention, or active mitigation systems can be considered in this scenario.\n \nReckitt Benckiser sought the advice of two independent expert explosion-modeling consultants on the appropriate model for the worst-case release scenario involving the flammable substance in the ISO Farm.  Both consultants arrived at the same model, and used the same model inputs, taking into account various factors such as the site layout and nature of the flammable substances. The endpoint distance is defined in the RMP Rule as the distance from the point of detonation to a point of an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  One psi is the amount of pressure generally required to break a typical glass window. The endpoint distance at the Belle Mead facility extends from the point of detonation in the ISO Farm into the wooded area of the Reckitt Benckiser property to the north and north-east; to the freight railroad tracks east of the facility; to Hillsborough Road just in front"

The only possible publicly accessible receptor identified in the hazard assessment of the worst-case release scenario is the area of Reckitt Benckiser property just beyond the fence line.  Although mostly owned by Reckitt Benckiser, the area is subject to uncontrolled public access.\n\nHazard Assessment - Alternate Release Scenario\nA similar modeling exercise was performed on several alternate release scenarios.  Alternate release scenarios represent those that are also unlikely to occur, but may be more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternate release scenarios include such incidents such as a pipe break, tank puncture, relief valve failure, or unloading hose rupture.  Such a release may result in such events as a pool fire, a vapor cloud fire, a vapor cloud explosion (as performed for the worst-case scenario), and a boiling liquid evaporating vapor explosion (BLEVE).\n\nThe EPA allows alternate release scenario models to take into account the use of existing safety, accident prevention, or active mitigation systems present at the facility such as emergency shut-off valves and water deluge systems.  The ISO Farm is equipped with state-of-the-art safety systems, including LPG sensing devices that automatically activate emergency shut-off valves when LPG is detected at less than half of its lower flammability limit, several water deluge systems, and check valves and excess flow valves that automatically close upon detection of irregular conditions (i.e., backflow).  The ISO Farm is also enclosed by a chain-linked fence with restricted access.  Vehicles are denied access to the fenced-in area surrounding the storage vessels in the ISO Farm. \n\nThis alternate release scenario was modeled using three consequences of such a release: a pool fire, a vapor cloud fire, and a VCE. These consequences were selected for the model based on the technical feasibilit"

Use of these consequences in the modeling does not reflect an indication of the probability that any of them may occur at the Belle Mead facility.  Endpoint distance from a pool fire was negligible because the rate of evaporation of LPG over the release time period would exceed the release rate; therefore, a liquid pool of LPG would not develop, and no risk of pool fire would occur.  The modeling also determined endpoint distances from a vapor cloud fire and a VCE.  Both a vapor cloud fire and VCE have the possibility of potential receptors on Reckitt Benckiser property just outside of the facility fence line. Although entirely owned by Reckitt Benckiser, the area is subject to uncontrolled public access.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Programs\nReckitt Benckiser places great importance on the implementation of procedures for responding to and, more importantly, preventing accidental releases of chemicals that have the potential to harm human health or the environment.  \nAt Reckitt Benckiser, we have adopted a rigorous approach to ensuring that hazardous chemicals and flammable liquids are used and stored safely.  One element of that approach is a thorough risk assessment, a formal and exhaustive analysis of chemical processes used to identify and address process hazards.  Risk assessments are conducted on a periodic basis for existing processes and immediately before the final design stage of new or modified processes.\n\nIn a typical risk assessment, team members from a variety of disciplines - engineers, team leaders, plant operators, and maintenance technicians - gather to analyze a chemical process. Every component of the process - pumps, piping, storage tanks, instruments, valves, controls, and safety devices - as well as operating and maintenance practices are evaluated to determine possible causes of failure. Each cause is then reviewe"

Although this regulation applies only to certain flammable liquids used at the Belle Mead facility, we recognize the importance and benefits of risk assessment to all our operations and have applied it to other processes that have the potential of creating a significant safety hazard.\n\nSubject to several Federal and state discharge prevention and process safety requirements for many years, Reckitt Benckiser maintains an environmental program that requires continuous evaluation and improvement of facility compliance programs, work practices, employee training programs, first-responder spill response capabilities, equipment maintenance and repair programs, leak detection systems, and other safety measures.  In an effort to enhance the effectiveness and organization of the several accidental release prevention programs and emergency response programs maintained at the Belle Mead facility, Reckitt Benckiser has recently prepared an Integrated Contingency Plan in compliance with the National Response Team's Integrated Contingency Plan.  This plan also provides guidance to include local emergency responders such as police, fire, and rescue as appropriate.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nFacilities subject to the RMP Rule are also required to report accidents and releases occurring in the last five years in which exposure to a regulated flammable substance, overpressure generated by an explosion of the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities at an environmental receptor on-site or off-site.

We also meet and exceed National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 58) standards for the LPG.  As a responsible corporate citizen and neighbor in the community, Reckitt Benckiser acknowledges its duty to prevent accidental releases of potentially harmful substances into the environment.  Reckitt Benckiser's strong environmental management program, including the elements of an effective Risk Management Program, commitment to personnel training and adherence to standard operating procedures ensure continuous environmental compliance and the attainment of Reckitt Benckiser's primary goal for the Belle Mead facility: \"Safety, Accident Prevention.\""
