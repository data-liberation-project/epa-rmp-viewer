This document has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations:     \n\n\n\n* Federal EPA's, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n* California Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThis document contains the necessary information to satisfy the EPA Risk Management Program and the CalARP Program regulations for facilities handling regulated substances in excess of the listed threshold quantity.  Specifically, this document consists of the Executive Summary as required by 40 CFR Part 68.155 (19 CCR '2745.3) and the Data Elements forms as required by 40 CFR Part 68.160 - 180 (19 CCR '2745.4 - .8).  Finally, this document contains the certification page required by 40 CFR Part 68.185 (19 CCR '2745.9).\n\n\n\nThis RMPlan document contains the information that will be submitted to the City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department for review.  The Program document is the system that supports the plan and ensures that the facilities are being operated safely.  The Program information can be found in the Phibro-Tech, Inc. Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program and Plan documents located at the facility.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThis RMPlan addresses the facility's administrative and operational programs to prevent accidents and reduce potential risks associated with handling regulated substances.  The regulated substance of concern at the Phibro-Tech facility is ammonia.  The process that uses or generates the regulated substance is the Ammonia Etchant System."

The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n* Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n* Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n* Hazard Assessment Summary\n\n* Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* Five Year Accident History\n\n* Emergency Response Program\n\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Phibro-Tech facility abides by the emergency  procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Action Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.)    To save lives.\n\n2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.)    To protect the environment.\n\n4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nPhibro-Tech, Inc. maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Phibro-Tech, Inc. facility is located at 8851 Dice Road, Santa Fe Springs, California.  The plant is located approximately 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) east of the 605 Freeway and 0.6 kilometers (0.4 miles)  south of Slauson Avenue.  This area is largely industrial complexes with the nearest residential areas to the west and northwest.\n\n\n\nThe regulated sub"

The occurrence of the regulated substance is described below.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Etchant System\n\n\n\nAmmonia, carbon dioxide, and other additives are used to produce product grade material from the residual ammonium chloride solutions resulting from the cupric chloride and copper ammonium chloride systems.  The ammonium chloride solutions are piped to the aqua ammonia solution tanks were the ammonia and carbon dioxide are added. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Phibro-Tech facility is ammonia.  The facility stores a maximum of 58,000 pounds of ammonia in the bulk ammonia tank.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Phibro-Tech, Inc. facility including each chemical recovery system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of chemical recovery systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors, automatic shut down buttons, and scrubbers.\n\n  \n\nAmmonia Detectors\n\n\n\nThe ammonia sensors are located in the vicinity of the ammonia storage tank, cupric oxide reactor, the maintenance shop, the laboratory, and on the north side of the facility, along the fence line (2).  The ammonia sensors are located outside and therefore are protected with a porous plastic cover to prevent contact with chemicals, dirt, water, or dust contaminants. \n\n\n\nEmergency Shut Down Buttons\n\n\n\nAmmonia remote emergency shut down (ESD) buttons are placed throughout the facility.  In the event of an emergency, the operator can use one of these buttons to shut off the ammonia flow.  The six ammonia EDS buttons are located near the ammonia etchant area, the maintenance shop, and the production office (2).\n\n\n\nChemical Storage Dike Areas\n\n\n\nAll of the chemical recovery process equipment and acid storage vessels are locat"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nAn Initial Hazard & Operability (HAZOP) Study was conducted on October 14-17, 1991 and February 11, 1992 for compliance with the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  On April 21, 1999, this study was reviewed and revalidated for compliance with this regulation.  During this revalidation session, all previous recommendations were reviewed.  Any incomplete recommendations were reviewed for applicability and added if necessary to the new list of recommendation.  The following outlines the outstanding mitigation measures as well as new recommendations from the revalidation study.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), the ammonia equipment was examined by a structural engineer to ensure seismic stability.  All recommendations were completed by May 2"
