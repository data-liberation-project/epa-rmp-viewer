(the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION: The primary activity at the facility relative to Risk Management Planning is the storage andsaleof fertilizers to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. It is stored in one (1) tank of 12,000 gallons (51,000 pounds) capacity and in 20 - 1,000 gallon nurse tanks (84,702 pounds) for a total poptential storage capacity of 135,702 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE & ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:A) The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be 1.8 miles. B) The Alternate Case Scenario, based on the five-year accidents history or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be approximately 26,600 pounds. The distance to the end point of dispersion to 200 ppm is estimated to be 1.6 miles.\n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Hand"

      "SummaryText": "ling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, the Standard K-61, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" of the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) has been adoptedby reference into Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacustions, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The facility has: a) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP), in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; and b) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions"
