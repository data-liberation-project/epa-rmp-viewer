We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.

This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes. These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\r\n\r\nHydrite stores one chemical regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program, Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) (7664-41-7). All storage tanks and containers are designed to comply with National Standards including U.S Department of Transportation and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Worst case scenarios and alternative scenarios are identified within the RMP. Hydrite Chemical has multiple release prevention programs integrated into all phases of operation from design through maintenance. Each chemical is reviewed for physical hazards, health hazards, environmental hazards and process hazards. Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis. Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release. Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals. Equipment mainte"

This Plan. The Plan includes:\r\n*  Actions facility personnel must take in the event of fire, explosion or release\r\n*  Arrangements with the local and state governments in the event of an accident\r\n*  Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all emergency responders\r\n*  Necessary emergency equipment and how it is to be implemented\r\n*  Resources available at the plant for use in responding such as chemical resistant suits, self-contained breathing apparatus, two-way radios for communication, gas monitors, and repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks.\r\n\r\nHydrite Chemical is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility and continually works to improve processes or procedures that advance our goal of zero releases."
