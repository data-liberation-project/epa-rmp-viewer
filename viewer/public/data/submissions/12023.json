These programs enable our facility to prevent the \noccurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant \nreleases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, \nand other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these \nprograms prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and \nillnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving \nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nmanufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such \nchemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of \nvessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which \nare located such that a hazardous chemical could be \ninvolved in a potential release shall be considered a \nsingle process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on \nthe rules, procedures, and practices which govern \nindividual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. \nThese rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They \nare also communicated to and accepted by all employees at \nthe facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCESS\n\nThe Fresh Express Facility is a Food Processing facility.  \nThe facility uses ammonia in an industrial refrigeration system\nto maintain temperatures in production rooms, coolers, and process water chillers. \nAmmonia refrigeration is the only process subject \nto the Risk Management Legislation. In addition there is a computer \nc"

Any irregular condition will result in the \nactivation of an automated paging system to contact refrigeration \npersonnel.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 11,100 lbs. \nof ammonia with the receiver quantity limited to 80 % of \nthe vessel capacity by facility procedures resulting in a \nten minute release. Under worst-case weather conditions, \nammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to \nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is \nunlikely for the following reasons: worst- case weather \nconditions are uncommon; the vessel is enclosed in a \nbuilding that would withstand and help to contain such a \nrelease; industry standards for the manufacture and quality \ncontrol of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in \nthis service; pressure safety valves limit operating \npressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in \nplace at the facility including the mechanical integrity \nprogram for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, \nand replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed \nammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms and \nthe auto-dialing system in place to warn operating \npersonnel of process upsets; and the emergency response \nplan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFailure of a weld in the condenser drain line returning liquid ammonia from the \ncondensers would result in a release of 8,745 pounds. Under common weather \nconditions, ammonia could travel .2 miles before dispersing enough to\nno longer pose a hazard to the public. This particular line was chosen as \nan alternative scenario because it is in an area of the \nplant where it could be struck and result in a release. \nThis scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: the location of the line is \nin an area where forklift use is typically for the aid of refrigeration \nmaintenance employees; no"
