      "SummaryText": "Wells' Dairy, Inc. (WDI) has developed a Risk Management Program Plan (RMP) for the use and storage of ammonia in the industrial refrigeration system at the St. George Ice Cream Plant in St. George, Utah.  The RMP was established to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act Risk Management Program as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulation, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\nWDI utilizes the applicable elements of it's Process Safety Management (PSM) program (29 CFR 1910) to fulfill the requirements of the level 3 release prevention and other applicable portions of the RMP.  Process specific training is provided to maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the refrigeration system's mechanical integrity is maintained throughout the life of the process.  Administative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly.  The various facets of the RMP and PSM programs are linked through documentation and communication.\nAn Intergarated Contingency Plan (ICP) was developed for response to various personnel, chemical, and weather related emergencies and to fulfill the emergency response requirements of a number of OSHA and EPA regulations."
