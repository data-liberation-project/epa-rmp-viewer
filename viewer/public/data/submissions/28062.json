      "SummaryText": "Ethanol 2000 is a joint venture of the Southwest Minnesota Agrifuels Cooperative and Broin Companies.  We produce denatured ethanol, used as a fuel additive to reduce air pollution and U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  The facility is located south of Bingham Lake and east of Windom, Minnesota.  Anhydrous ammonia, commonly used in refrigeration and as agricultural fertilizer, is used in the ethanol manufacturing process to control acidity.   Ethanol 2000 meets all applicable federal, state and local regulatory requirements.  To ensure protection for our employees, neighbors and the environment we often go well beyond regulatory requirements.  For example, in the case of ammonia storage and handling, our policy, procedures and equipment, plus training- all work together to form an effective accident prevention plan.  We never have had a harmful ammonia or alcohol-related incident at Ethanol 2000.  In the unlikely event that an emergency were to occur, however, an emergency response plan is in place to minimize an accident's impact.  This is a plan that is coordinated with the Windom Police and Fire Departments, the Cottonwood County Sheriff, the Windom Area Hospital, the Cottonwood County Environmental Office and the Windom Area Rescue Squad."
