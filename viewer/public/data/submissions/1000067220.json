      "SummaryText": "Morito Scovill Americas, LLC dba Scovill Fasteners, Inc. uses chlorine to treat wastewater from brass and copper plating operations.  The chlorine operations consist of one 2,000 pound cylinder containing chlorine liquefied under pressure.  Chlorine from the cylinder is piped to a vaporizer.  From the vaporizer, chlorine is piped to the water treatment system.  There are up to two reserve cylinders in storage at the facility, so the maximum amount of chlorine stored on site is 6,000 pounds. Based on criteria specified in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 (CAAA), the facility is required to develop and implement this Risk Management Plan meeting Program 3 requirements.\r\n \r\nThe worst case release scenario is a failure of one of the two chlorine cylinders when it is full, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine followed by vapor cloud dispersion.  This worst-case scenario was recommended by Georgia Environmental Protection Division in their letter to the facility dated October 1, 2001, and included Appendix M.  The distances to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L under worst-case and alternate scenarios were calculated using U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) model, RMP*Comp Online Browser Version executed on June 10, 2014.\r\n  \r\nScovill Fasteners, Inc. has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings-in-place.\r\n  \r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, it is Scovill Fasteners' policy to notify the Clarkesville Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Scovill Fasteners has discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected the chlorine system. They have the equipment necessary to control an emergency of this magnitude and Scovill Fasteners has documentation from them verifying this.\r\n\r\nThis update to the 2009 Risk Management Plan was submitted to the EPA via R"
