Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the facilities on the Sheetz property in Claysburg, Pennsylvania.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nSheetz Distribution Services, LLC. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a unforeseeable release does occur, our highly trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with local fire department and area hazmat team which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Program\n\nSheetz Distribution Services, LLC. has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.
