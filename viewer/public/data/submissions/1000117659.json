This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as safety personnel training and automated shutdown and deluge systems. The objective of risk management is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the facility\u0092s personnel are trained to implement the appropriate emergency response protocols and work with local responders to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Wilsonart Adhesives facility, located in Temple, Texas, manufactures contact adhesives and operates an adhesive canister filling process. The Wilsonart canister filling process utilizes various proprietary mixtures of Di-methyl-ether (DME), A70 (a mixture of propane and isobutane), Solstice PFC, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen.  These chemicals are used as propellants that are injected into portable canisters. The canisters are pre-filled filled with adhesive to produce a contact adhesive product that can be sprayed directly onto surfaces.\n\nA proprietary material known as Wilsonart 1040 is used as a solvent in the manufacture of contact adhesives.  Wilsonart 1040 and other solvents stored in eight separate tanks is pumped to several mixing kettles located in the Mix Room. These kettles are partially filled with specific ratios of solvents and solid additives, such as synthetic rubber and tackifying resins. The internal kettle mixing blades are activated and the blend is mixed as necessary to produce the desired adhesive properties. Upon completion of the mixing step, the finished adhesive product is transferred to totes, drums and pails for shipment to customers.\n\nThe af"

This Guidance prescribes the parameters required by the RMP rule for both Worst-Case (WCS) and Alternative Release (ARS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS analysis revealed that even in an extremely unlikely case of a full release of total contents of one of the pressurized tanks containing highly flammable materials followed up with the vapor cloud explosion, substantial damage may only occur at several industrial properties located within 0.3 mile from the tanks.  No residential or commercial properties will be affected.  The ARS analysis based on more realistic assumptions demonstrated that no substantial damage will be observed outside of the Wilsonart property boundaries.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Wilsonart Adhesives facility. This section addresses the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Program, Management of Changes, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Wilsonart Adhesives facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating operating procedures and training to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams. Employees have access to information created as part of"

Wilsonart management is committed to maintaining current and complete documentation for the contact adhesives manufacturing process and the canister filling operation. Preserving such information forms the foundation for hazard analyses, management of change, and the overall maintenance efficiency at the facility. Wilsonart has put in place a policy and procedure to have applicable process safety information for each of the facility's covered processes in an up to date and accessible state at all times. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) studies provide a basis for determining the potential of hazards associated with the contact adhesives manufacturing and the canister filling operation and develop mitigation actions to reduce such hazards. Upon completion of an initial PHA study, Process Safety Management (PSM)-covered operations at Wilsonart will be subjected to periodic reviews by an interdisciplinary team in an effort to systematically identify significant hazardous potentials in design, control and operation. The goal of this policy and procedure is to provide definitive methods for evaluating the covered operations for potentially catastrophic incidents which could either cause safety and health hazards to facility employees, the public, or harm the environment. It is also the goal of this policy and this procedure to eliminate such potential by resolving issues which are identified by such evaluations.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nConcise and informative Operating Procedures and safe work practices provide an essential basis for training and provide critical guidance to operators who perform routine operatio"

Evaluation of these procedures and work practices by employees familiar with the process is also required to ensure that they are safe and usable, and that all applicable information is incorporated into a formal written procedure. Wilsonart has adopted a policy and procedure that establishes a standard method of developing, implementing, and maintaining written procedures for the safe operation of all equipment handling Wilsonart 1040 and the canisters filling operations equipment that contain A70 or Dimethyl Ether (DME).\n\nTraining\n\nEach employee presently involved in operating the contact adhesives manufacturing or the canister filling system at the Wilsonart Adhesives facility shall be trained in an overview of the process and in the associated operating procedures. The training shall include emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee\u0092s assigned tasks. Affected employees receive periodic refresher training and competency testing.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Wilsonart Contractor qualification process is designed to ensure that contractors engaged to do work at the Wilsonart Adhesives facility adhere to strict safety performance standards. This includes obtaining and evaluating information regarding to the contract employer\u0092s safety performance and programs. Contract employers are informed of the known potential fire, explosion, or other kinds of release hazards related to the contractor\u0092s work and the process.\nPre-startup and Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nWilsonart policy and procedures require a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) before commissioning any new canister filling facilities or modifications to the contact adhesives manufacturing process or the canister filling facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the"

A systematic checklist of actions that must be completed prior to the start-up of any new PSM-covered process or process change.\n\nHot Work\n\nThe Wilsonart Adhesives facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. These include safety orientations for contractors, control of the entry/exit of visitors, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, and procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment. \n\nIn particular, proper precautions must be taken during hot work operations at the Wilsonart Adhesives facility due to the potential for uncontrolled ignition sources causing a fire or an explosion. Accordingly, Wilsonart employs a Hot Work Permit System. The Hot Work permit must be prepared and authorized prior to any temporary operation which involves open flames and/or sparks (cutting, brazing, grinding, welding, etc.).

Such investigations shall focus on the identification of Root Causes and the corresponding corrective measures to prevent recurrences. To this end, this procedure establishes the requirements for incident investigation, documentation, employee communication, and correction of unsafe conditions.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Wilsonart Adhesives facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program have been implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Wilsonart management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Wilsonart Adhesives facility has an excellent history of prevention of accidents that hurt its employees or resulted in significant material damage to the equipment.  No accidents involving the PSM- and RMP-regulated reportable to the U.S. EPA occurred in the five-year period preceding submission of this Risk Management Plan to the U.S. EPA.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Wilsonart Adhesives facility maintain"

      "SummaryText": "s a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a loss of containment, including possibility of a spill, fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Wilsonart maintains the necessary equipment and trains its personnel to conduct incipient firefighting and limited spill containment and cleanup operations. In the unlikely event that a major fire or chemical release beyond this scope were to occur, Wilsonart would rely on the Temple Fire and Rescue Department to handle the response.  The facility meets the regulatory obligation to conduct periodic notification and other kinds of drills with the local firefighters.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWilsonart Adhesives facility staff conducts routine safety audits, Job Safety Analyses and safety meetings. The results of these activities and employee recommendations for safety improvements are the foundation of Wilsonart efforts to continuously improve safety performance."
