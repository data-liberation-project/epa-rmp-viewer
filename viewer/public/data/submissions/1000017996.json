Old Town Fuel and Fiber manufactures kraft market pulp at the facility commensing in March of 2009.  The mill is located on the Penobscot River in Old Town, Maine.\r\n\r\nThe facility produces northern hardwood pulp. Pulp is produced on one Kamyr continuous digesters. The pulp from the digester is piped to the bleach plant. The bleaching operations use chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber. Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution. The emissions from this process are also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances and Process\r\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage. This process stores chlorine dioxide solution in a 190,000 gallon storage tank at typical concentrations of 10.5 grams per liter. The maximum concentration (before interlocks) is 11.5 grams per liter. A full storage tank at this concentration is equivalent to 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide.\r\n\r\nSince the resulting toxic endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case release of chlorine dioxide potentially encompasses public receptors, and the bleaching process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this process is subject to Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program Steps at the Old Town Mill\r\n\r\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA's 40 CFR Part"

      "SummaryText": "68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program. The prevention program thus developed and implemented consists of the twelve elements listed below.\r\n\r\n1.\tProcess safety information\r\nOld Town Fuel and Fiber maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the process. The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technology data of the process and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the process. The facility ensures that this process safety information is maintained, accurate, and available to all employees, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). All of the information and documentation for the RMP Prevention Program is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical and chemical properties of the hazardous substances handled at the facility, including non-regulated substances in the covered process. MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available on \tthe mill's intranet where operators can reference this information. In addition, MSDS's are \tprovided to the LEPC and/or Plant Emergency Response Team for use in helping formulate emergency response plans\r\n\r\nMany of the operating parameters are included in the technology information to help with \tthe safe operation of the process.

Old Town Fuel and Fiber believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment.\r\n\r\nH.\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the off site consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors. Pubic receptors are off site residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release. Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nThis section describes the worst-case and alternate scenario consequence analyses. These analyses comprise the hazard assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at Old Town Fuel and Fiber is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a storage tank containing 190,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution. In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide, in solution, were assumed to be released over a ten minute period. Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, Old Town Fuel and Fiber considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in te"

Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than that of ambient air. For this reason, a concentrated plume resulting from a large accidental release would display dense-gas behavior. That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational slumping caused by the density difference. EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Among these models is the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1). DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to simulate dispersion of dense-gas releases, is the only dense-gas model included in U.S. EPA's Guideline on Air Quality Models (40 CFR Parts 51 and 52, Appendix B). DEGADIS has therefore been used to model the chlorine dioxide worst-case release.\r\n\r\nThe modeling was conducted using the prescribed weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability. These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies. No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L). This is equal to the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level of 10 ppm, divided by a safety factor of 10 to account for sensitive individuals. The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment.

The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees. 'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings or forests and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of Old Town Fuel and Fiber, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more 'rural', especially along the Penobscot River. In order to report the most conservative 'distance to toxic endpoint' estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Old Town Fuel and Fiber has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming 'rural' surface conditions. This is reflected in the use of a low 10 cm surface roughness in DEGADIS.\r\n\r\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of 9.3 miles to chlorine dioxide's toxic endpoint of 1 ppm (0.0028 mgIL). Figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical 9.3-mile radius.
