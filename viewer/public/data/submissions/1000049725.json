Joliet Facility has been a chemical processing plant since 1972. The 1.6 acre Facility is currently receiving non-ignitable, non-reactive metal bearing inorganic materials to be processed on-site. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the processes. All raw materials are purchased and stored in tanks specifically designed for their unique requirements.  All storage tanks are diked and/or in uniquely designed storage areas to prevent any loss of materials.\n\n\n\nThere are two indoor container storage areas; one in the East Warehouse and one in the West Warehouse, where raw materials are stored prior to processing.\n\nThere are also Tank Storage areas for storing bulk liquids. There are twelve tanks in Tank Storage Area #1 and one in Tank Storage Area #2.\n\n\n\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for day-to-day operations at the Facility. The Plant Manager's duties include: managing personnel requirements, scheduling and coordinating plant production and material flow, developing job safety practices, ensuring day-to-day compliance with all applicable regulations and permits, maintaining all required documents and records, and implementing and coordinating Contingency Plan procedures.\n\n\n\nThe Technical Manager position includes developing and implementing management systems and programs to support operations at the site.  Duties include developing policies and procedures, conducting compliance audits and inspections, preparing and presenting training programs, consulting to the company's sales personnel, consult and support management projects on design, construction and modifications in reference to environmental requiremen"

The Facility Contingency Plan will be implemented whenever there is a release greater than one gallon.\n\n\n\nClassroom and on-the-job training is provided to employees involved in all processing activities as part of the Safety and Health Program. Initial training for new employees consists of 24 hours duration to enable employees to perform their duties in a safe and healthful manner.
