The management and the employees of the Lebanon Plant of Lebanon Chemical Corporation have been instructed in and subscribe to this policy and are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Lebanon facility.  If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the Lebanon County Emergency Planning Committee, The Avon Fire Department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary activity at the Lebanon facility of Lebanon Chemical Corporation is the manufacture of fertilizers for sale to the lawn and garden user (homeowner) and the professional market as golf courses.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, generally by railroad tank cars or occasionally, by tanker trucks, stored; and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility would be 290,000 pounds (130,000 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 80% capacity, which is a facility policy, and 160,000 pounds contained in a loaded railroad tank car).  This maximum storage would only happen in rare circumstances.\n\n3.The general accidental release prevention program:\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" - published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; the standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29CFR1910, 111 - \"storage and handling of AnhydrousAmmonia\"; and OSHA 29CFR1910,119 - process safety management standard.\n\n4.The five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility h"

A written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR1910,38;\n\nb. provided state and local authorities, and the fire department the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA),\n\nc. a written response program in accordance with the OSHA standard 29CFR1910,120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training. \n\n\nThis facilities' Emergency Response Program has been reviewed by the Lebanon County Emergency Planning committee and is incorporated in the Lebanon County Emergency Response Plan.  A copy of this plan is available for review at the Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency by appointment.  An annual ammonia leak drill is carried out on site by site personnel and personnel from the  Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency.\n\n6.Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the Lebanon facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and conditions.  There are no additional specific Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
