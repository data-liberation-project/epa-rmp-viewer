      "SummaryText": "Pioneer Frozen Foods, which is owned by C.H. Guenther & Son, operates a food manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas, that prepares and freezes baked goods for commercial use.  The ammonia refrigeration system is used for the freezing process.\n\n\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to Pioneer Frozen Foods because the plant handles and stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of threshold quantities. The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the freezers. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, ?112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Pioneer Frozen Foods is committed to the safe operation of their facility to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Pioneer Frozen Foods, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the local fire department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The ammonia refrigeration system at Pioneer Frozen Foods involves the handling and storage of one chemical, anhydrous ammonia, in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r).  "
