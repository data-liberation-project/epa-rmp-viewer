(OREG2) Recovered Energy Generation (REG) facility complies with numerous standards for pressure vessel design and testing as well as all Federal and Montana process safety management requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference. Regular inspection and testing of the pentane and thermal oil systems are performed to ensure equipment integrity is maintained. The facility is equipped with a network of leak detection equipment, automatic shutdown logic controls, insulation, safety relief valves, fire detection monitors. OREG2 provides high levels of training in operating procedures, safety and emergency response. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to implement the emergency response procedures to mitigate damages, and to notify the nearest fire department and request their assistance.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source\n\nThe OREG2 power units are fueled by waste heat from a compressor turbine exhaust that is transferred from thermal energy into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by utilizing the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The hot gases of the turbine exhaust flow through a Waste Heat Oil Heater (WHOH), where the heat from the gases is transferred to a thermal oil heat transfer fluid. The thermal oil is then circulated to the shell and tube vaporizer of an Ormat Energy Converter (OEC). The motive fluid on the shell side is vaporized and these vapors drive a special organic fluid turbine. This turbine, which rotates at 1800 rpm, drives a generator which produces grid compatible power. The motive f1uid then passes through a heat exchanger and enters the cycle agai"

After exiting the various heat exchangers, the thermal oil passes through the thermal oil surge tanks and the thermal oil feed pumps, which discharge it into the WHOH. The power from this project is sold to Basin Electric Power Cooperative based in Bismarck, ND.\n\nThe basic Rankine cycle model consists of four components:\n1.\tPump -Work Input\n2.\tBoiler -Heat Input\n3.\tTurbine -Work Output\n4.\t Condenser -Heat Rejection\n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (pentane), vaporizing the high-pressure liquid, expanding the high-pressure vapor and condensing the low-pressure vapor for reuse. The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by thermal oil at a maximum temperature of 572\u00b0F. The thermal energy is transferred to the pentane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers. The OREG2 facility uses a commercial pentane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\n\nPrimary Activities \n\nWaste thermal energy is converted to electric power. The facility is rated at 6000 KW. The net power output to the electrical grid is rated at 5100 KW. Power output is reduced in warm weather due to limitations of the air-cooled heat exchangers.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\n\nPentane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid pentane is pumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers. Thermal energy provided by thermal oil is transferred to the pentane. The thermal oil heat input causes the pentane to change physical states from liquid to high-pressure superheated vapor that is passed through a turbine to produce electric power. The vapor is condensed and recycled back to a pressurized liquid recuperator vessel to complete the Rankine cycle. A pentane storage tank is available for makeup. The facility design is segregated into multiple sections, each having its own design specifications dictated by the pentane conditions in that section. The sections include: the low-pressure process equipment, the high pr"

The nominal maximum liquid inventory exists when the facilities are not operating. At that time the energy in the pentane is reduced and most of the inventory is present as a liquid in the liquid recuperator vessels.

The facility is located approximately 11.3 km northeast of the community of Culbertson in Roosevelt County, Montana. Examination of topographic maps, aerial photographs and visual observation of the potentially affected area in a worst case scenario did not identify any residential structures, parks or other public places.\n\nPrevention Program Description\n\nSafety Information:\n\nMaintenance procedures: OREG2 has installed and operates a Computerized Maintenance Management software (CMMS) program. This CMMS contains information on all equipment in the facility requiring maintenance, inspections, testing, certification, calibration, etc. NFPA, OSHA, manufacturer's recommendations and operations experience have been utilized to produce a comprehensive maintenance work order system that produces maintenance requests at appropriate frequencies. Employees report any equipment deficiencies to the operation and Maintenance Manager who generates \"work orders\" for the repair or assessment of the problem. Routine comprehensive inspections are performed using checklists.\n\nEmergency Response Plan: The emergency response plan is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.\n\nTraining: some equipment in the OREG2 facilities poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not fol1owed correctly. Safety training, conducted monthly and required of all employees, identifies the different hazards to be found on the sites. These subjects include electrical safety, fire prevention and protection, lock out and tag out procedures, hazard communication, gas detectors, fire panels, personal protective equipment, and the safe use of tools and equipment. Safety training is supplemented by the use of the Industrial Hygiene and St"

If any of these events should occur the monitoring staff will immediately contact the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manager. If the O&M Manager is not reached in a timely manner the parent company, Ormat Nevada Inc. will be notified on the 24-hour phone number (775) 852-1912. If a fire is detected the monitoring staff shall notify local emergency personnel including fire and police departments.\n\nNotification of Northern Pipeline Personnel: Any Northern Border Pipeline personnel which may be at the site during the alarm condition must also be notified through Northern Border Pipeline procedures. Northern Border Pipeline personnel should not attempt to respond to the alarm conditions unless they have been trained and certified to do so. The principal methods of accident prevention include equipment design safeguards, written procedures and operator/employee training. Safety systems are present in the facilities and have various methods of operation.\n\nPressure safety systems typically have three levels of degree. The initial degree is an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The next more severe degree is a shutdown of process equipment likely to be causing or exacerbating the condition and an alarm that is presented audibly and visually to the Control Room Operator. The third and most severe degree of pressure safety system are pressure safety valves (PSV) which relieve to atmosphere or to larger low pressure systems. Some of these PSV's also have Control Room Alarms.\n\nA combustible gas detection system is present in each of the plants. Sensors are strategically located in each plant.

A Hazop analysis was selected and utilized.\n\nAn analysis was performed on the power cycle. The Hazop analysis was performed on the Alliance Kerrobert REG project which is similar to the OREG2 plants with only a few minor differences:\n\n1.\tIncreased number of Air cooler bays in OREG2\n2.\tA minor Increase in generator rating (in OREG2)\n\nAccident History\n\nOREG2 CS-3 REG facility does not have an accident record, since it is a new facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nOREG2\u00bfs Emergency Response is based on recognition and observation of potential emergency conditions, and immediate repair, or notification of the primary response agency. The policy for emergency response at OREG2 is to mitigate any accident by implementing emergency procedures that have been developed for all known contingencies. Small fires will be contained and mitigated with fire extinguishing equipment and automatic suppression systems. Emergency notification is required for any release or threatened release of a hazardous material which poses a significant present or potential health, safety or environmental hazard. The O&M Manager is designated incident command when present. The senior operator is designated incident command when management is not present. Incident command is transferred to emergency responders upon arrival."
