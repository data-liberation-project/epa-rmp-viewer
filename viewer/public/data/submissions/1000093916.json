The information contained in this program is applicable to only a portion of TrueCore's overall manufacturing operations, which includes the generation of polyurethane foam; this process will utilize a chemical identified as CP-80 along with other surfactants, catalysts, and/or additives contained in the unique formulations.  For the purpose of this process, CP-80 consists of a mixture 80% Cyclopentane and 20% Isopentane as a combined bulk pentane product. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAlthough other chemicals will be present in the process, pentane is the primary consideration due to its flammable properties.  Both Cyclopentane (chemical formula C5H10) and Isopentane (chemical formula C5H12) used in the formulation of the pentane occur as a colorless liquid that has a slight petroleum-like odor.  In TrueCore's manufacturing process, these forms of pentane are used as ingredients (blowing agent) in the production of polyurethane foam, which serves as an excellent thermal and acoustic insulator.  The portion of TrueCore's production process that is relevant to this program (i.e. covered process) occurs from the point of unloading bulk CP-80 into the onsite underground storage tank (UST) through the point of injection of a blended material (polyol-resin), which contains the pentane blend into the panel shells to generate foam insulation within the single production line.  The covered process specifically includes the following equipment and operations: \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nExterior pentane delivery unloading station, 12,200 gallon underground storage tank (UST), static unloading pump skid, and two (2) transfer pump skids; \n\n\n\nInterior metering skid containing metering and temperature control equipment in addition to one (1) 66-gallon day tank; \n\n\n\nManufacturing area that includes a single pour table and associated process equipment and operatio"
