      "SummaryText": "The Shelbyville Municipal Water and Sewer Commission is owned by the City of Shelbyville, and is operated through a 5 member Board of Commissioners, with the Mayor as Chairman. Daily operations are conducted by a full time Manager. The Commission has always provided for safety considerations for its employees as well as the community.\n\nThe goal of the Risk Management Program is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury from accidnetal release of Chemicals. The Commission's management is committed to that goal.\n\nThe Commission uses chlorine for disinfection purposes at both the water treatment plant, and the wastewater treatment plant, and considers chlorine disinfection as vital to the community health and safety. The Commission has always been aware that the release of chlorine constitutes a public risk to the\ncommunity, and through close cooperation with the local LERC, Fire Departments, and DES personnell, has treated this matter with concern. \n\nIn the late 1980's a local emergeny response plan was implemented for both plants, in conjunctiuon with the local response agencies. Drills are conducted on an annual basis at the Wastewater Treatment Plant, and have been conducted at the Water Treatment Plant. However, drills at the Water Treatment plant have \nbeen non-existant for at least 5 years, for various reasons, including employee turnover, and recent plant expansions, although an Emergency Response Plan is in effect, and training has been conducted during recent years .\n\n\n\nThrough extensive work in developing the RMPlan, the Commission has determined that increased emphasis must be placed on Risk Management of these processes, and has been in the process of reorganizing staff in order to become more effective in this area. The staff, after completion of the Process Hazards Analysis is now reviewing procedures, personnel and materials, to improve and comply with the new RMPlan.\n\nThe Commission has normally relied upon consultants to provide materia"

      "SummaryText": "ls/equipment, and through this review, we have realized that there are deficiencies within this system, and will now rely upon in-house training, outside training, and the Prevention Plan to insure that the consultants use BAT to minimize the event of a release.\n\nThe Commission used OCA Guidance to develop the worst case scenario, and the release are similar to the plan that was in place. We feel the new plan will make control of an event even more effective through better Administrative controls such as planning, prevention, hot work permitting, and contractor safety plan.\n\nThe Commission has recently purchased a 24 hour chlorine gas generator to add to our chlorine alarm system that will provide verification of reliability by performing self-checks every 24 hours of the alarm system itself. PHA's have generated other ideas that will need to be reviewed and quantified prior to implementation.  \n\nThe Commission is proud of not having any releases within the last 5 years (actual much more than 5 years), and hopes with the implementation of the new RMPlan that that record will be extended for many more years."
