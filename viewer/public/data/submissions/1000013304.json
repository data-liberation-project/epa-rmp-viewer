This terminal satisfies the definition of a Program 3 terminal as found in 40 CFR Part 68.10(d), and is therefore required to generate and maintain an appropriate RMP.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy: Plains LPG Services, L.P. (Plains) and its affiliated limited partnerships adhere to high standards of environmental quality and are committed to operating all Plains terminals in a manner to protect the health and safety of its employees, the communities surrounding our terminals, and the environment. The emergency response policy of Plains is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency response procedures when necessary with the prime objective of protecting the safety and health of all personnel and the public and to mitigate to the greatest extent feasible the impact to the environment. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority in any emergency event. Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the secondary issues of property presevation and business recovery be addressed.\n\nTerminal Description: The terminal is located at 20715 67th Ave. Arlington, WA 98223, Snohomish County. The GPS (Nad 83) Coordinates for the terminal are: Latitude: 48.183778 and Longitude: -122.136472. The terminal is located in an industrial area. The terminal is fenced and contains two (2) 30,000 gallon LPG storage vessels with a maximum working capacity of 26,100 gallons each. Two pumps, a compressor, meters and associated piping and valves are also a part of the terminal.\n\nRegulated Substances at Terminal: The only regulated substance at the terminal is Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG (Propane).\n\nSummary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results: The Offsite Consequence Analysis assumed a \"worst-case\" catastrophic, instances release of all "

      "SummaryText": "of the LPG stored in one of the two vessels each at the maximum working capacity of 26,100 gallons, i.e, approximately 110,664 lbs. A second \"alternate release\" scenario considered was a release from a \"pull away.\" A \"pull away\" can occur if a driver fails to remove the hose between the storage tank and the transfer vehicle before moving the vehicle. In this scenario, the safety valves are assumed to work as designed thus limiting the release of LPG to the contents of a 2-inch diameter hose. The total quantity released is 17 lbs. The \"pull away\" scenario is considered the most likely relaease that could occur. The Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed with the RMP*Comp, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) consequence analysis software program. Under the \"worst-case\" scenario, the estimated distance to the 1 psi oerpressure point from a vapor cloud explosion is approximately 48 feet. The nearest public receptor to the terminal is immediately East from the terminal fence line and approximately 150 feet from the location of the terminal storage vessels. There are no designated environmental receptors nearby.\n\nFive Year Accident History: There are no prior accidents on record at this terminal.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary: Plains has developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during planning, responding and follow-up to an emergency at the facility, The emergency response procedures in this Risk Management Plan (RMP) are designed to comply with OSHA Standard 29 CFR Part 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans) and the emergency response element of Process Safety Management, (PSM). Specific emergency response procedures for each type of emergency that could affect this terminal are addressed in the Plains LPG Services Emergency Response Plan, which is a separate document from the RMP. Section 8 of this RMP discusses the Plains Emergency Response Program in additional detail. Plains does not staff an E"

Some of the actions that Plains staff may take are included in the emergency response procedures in Section 8.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: There are no planned changes to the facility to improve safety."
