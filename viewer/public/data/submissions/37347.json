      "SummaryText": "Company: Devon Corporation\nFacility Name:  Thomasma No. 8 Facility\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe facility is located approximately 6.0 miles south of Mirando City, Webb County, Texas off Farm Road 649.  Head south from Mirando City on Farm Road 649 go 6.0 miles, turn right on unimproved lease road, go 8.0 miles to location.  The area surrounding the facility is sparsely populated used primarily for cattle ranching and oil and gas exploration and production.  The latitude and longitude of the facility was obtained using a hand-held Garmin GPSMAP 60CS device with an accuracy of less than 15 meters.  The facility can be located on the USGS quadrangle map entitled Mirando City quadrangle.\n\nThe facility processes natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), and condensate/oil from various field wells.  Production, low-pressure gas and liquids from the incoming wells is directed to an inlet separator.  The separated gas then goes to a first-stage compressor and exits at 840 psi to the facility's fluid extraction system.  This system is designed to reduce incoming gas presssure to approximately 300 psig thereby forcing a reduction in temperature.  This cooling effect causes the gas stream to partially condense thus forming NGL.  NGL is a mixture of propane, butane, pentane and other heavier hydrocarbons.  The NGL is stored in a 17,000 gallon pressurized tank until it is transported for sales by a pressurized tank truck service.  The NGL tank normally operates between 125 -150 psi and ambient temperature.  The produced gas is recompressed to 840 psi and then sent to a glycol dehydration system before entering the sales line.\n\nPentane is the predominant (approximately 36% by weight) substance in NGL.  The threshold quantity for flammable substances under 40 CFR part 68 is 10,000 lbs.  It is the industry standard to not exceed 80% of the total tank capacity, therefore the recommended maximum amount of NGL stored is approximately 13,600 gallons (80% of 17,000).  However, to determine the "

      "SummaryText": "worst-case scenario the NGL tank was assumed filled to maximum capacity with no process controls or mitigation procedures available.  Based on the average composition of the NGL mix and the liquid density of the components found in the Practical Petroleum Engineer's Handbook, 5th edition, the maximum storage capacity is 85,000 lbs. of NGL. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity.  This type of release may occur as a result of catastrophic nature or other unforeseen disaster, such as total tank failure or the failure of all installed safety devices.  A release of 85,000 lbs. of NGL for a duration of 10 minutes in the form of a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) due to a 1 psi overpressurization results in a 0.4 mile distance to the endpoint.  Based on an actual site visit and verified by Devon operator knowledge of the surrounding area and USGS maps there are no public or environmental receptors within a 0.40-mile radius of the facility.  The nearest known public receptors are located approximately between 5.5 and 6.0 miles northeast of the facility in Mirando City, Texas.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a program 1 site.\n\nThe facility has not experienced a release that caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.\n\nA prevention program is not required for this facility.  As a prudent operator Devon Louisiana Corporation is aware of the General Duty Clause and therefore provides the proper training to its employees to maintain a safe working environment and to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  The 17,000-gallon storage tank is equipped with relief valves venting to the atmosphere that automatically operate according to preset pressure specifications.  Manual shut-off valves are located at the NGL extraction vessel effluent"

Devon Energy operates under a company emergency response plan that is available to all facility personnel.  Emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the Webb County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Mirando City Fire Department.\n\nThis facility qualifies as a Program 1 facility because:\n\n*The facility has not experienced an accidental release that caused death, injury or property damage within the past five years.\n*The distance to the flammable endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n*Emergency response procedures have been coordinated with the local emergency planning and response organization."
