It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities encompass loading/unloading and storage of propellants used in the aerosol and foaming industries. We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Butane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] and Propane. Butane is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent. Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent. Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 2011 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDiversified CPC International, Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.
