Duffield, VA Plant\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt the Tempur Production Duffield, Virginia Plant, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  \n\n\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental prevention program will help ensure that a release of TDI to the environment is unlikely.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture flexible polyurethane foam and fabricate foam mattresses and pillows for retail distribution.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received in tank truck quantities.  TDI tank trucks are unloaded in a fully enclosed section of the plant building called the chemical offloading area.  This area has a sub grade secondary containment structure capable of holding the entire liquid contents of a TDI tank truck.  The containment structure has a maximum volume of 6,611 gallons.  The TDI is stored in three (3) indoor storage tanks each with a 6,600 gallon (working tank capacity).  The tanks have a high level capacity of 7,546 gallons for an aggregate storage of 201,366 pounds (working tank capacity) and 230,228 pounds (high level capacity). The TDI storage area is encompassed by a secondary containment structure capable of capturing releases in exc"

      "SummaryText": "ess of the largest vessel's capacity. The TDI is piped to metering units where it is mixed with other reactants to produce polyurethane slabstock and molded polyurethane foam.  TDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored on-site exceeds EPA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI does not impact persons across the property boundary or the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), (3) The plant has not had a release of a regulated substance in the last five (5) years and (4) Tempur Production Duffield has coordinated it's emergency response activities with the local responders.\n\n\n\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n\nRelease detection:\n\n-Process Alarms\n\n-Operator Surveillance Activities\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control:\n\n-Secondary containment to contain TDI liquid releases\n\n-TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n\n-Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g. high level, high pressure)\n\n-Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n\n-Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n-Vapor from storage tank is piped to the unloading vessel\n\n\n\nReleas"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant processes.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The plant has around-the-clock communication capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the Duffield Fire Department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\n"
