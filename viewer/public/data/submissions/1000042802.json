The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits\r\nusing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective\r\ninstrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and\r\nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design\r\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a\r\nbasis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed\r\nchanges to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with\r\nthe various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is\r\nsystematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to\r\nmanage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe gas plant primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.   \r\n\r\nHobart Ranch Plant, owned and operated by Enbridge Pipelines (Texas Gathering) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Enbridge assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Hobart Ranch Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant, located in rural Hemphill County, Texas, 13 miles South of Canadian, Texas on Highway 83 operates a natural gas liquids extraction process and other processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane) from field gas.

As such, the Hobart Ranch plant is a Program 1 RMP facility.\r\n\r\nThe Hobart Ranch Plant consists of primarily NGL recovery facilities which include gas compression gycol and molecular sieve gas dehydration, propane gas refrigeration, dewpoint control and cryogenic NGL recovery, and supporting tankage and other facilities.\r\n\r\nThe inlet gas stream(s) enter the plant through pipeline(s) and flow through inlet separation equipment, which separates separable inlet condensate from produced/slop water from the gas. The gas stream from the liquids separation equipment flows up through the triethylene gycol (TEG) gas dehydration unit contactor. The dehydrated gas flows through the propane based gas refrigeration unit, which lowers the temperature of the gas and condenses/separates heavier (primarily butanes+) NGL components from the gas before the gas enters the cyrogenic NGL recovery unit.  Propane is used as the refrigerant in the closed cycle gas refrigeration unit, the the propane vapor stream is compressed by the gas engine/refrigerant compressor units.  The chilled gas from the propane based gas refrigeration unit flows through the cyrogenic NGL recovery unit, which significantly lowers the pressure and temperature of the gas, as well as removes energy from the gas, enabling lighter (primarily ethane and propane) NGL to be separated form the gas.  The separated NGL is stored in one (1) 27,000-gallon pressurized tank, and exits the site through pipeline(s).  The residue gas stream for the cryogenic NGL extraction unit is compressed by gas engine/gas compressor units before flowing offsite through sales gas pipeline(s).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hobart Ranch gas\r\nplant.
