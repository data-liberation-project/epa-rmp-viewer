This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.   \n\n\n\nHobart Ranch Plant, owned and operated by Enbridge Pipelines (Texas Gathering) L.P., is committed to the same quality of safety and environmental excellence that all other Enbridge assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter the Hobart Ranch Plant complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant, located in rural Hemphill County, Texas, 13 miles South of Canadian, Texas on Highway 83 operates a natural gas liquids extraction process and other processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane) from field gas.  The gas"

As such, the Hobart Ranch plant is a Program 1 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch Plant consists of primarily NGL recovery facilities which include gas compression gycol and molecular sieve gas dehydration, propane gas refrigeration, dewpoint control and cryogenic NGL recovery, and supporting tankage and other facilities.\n\n\n\nThe inlet gas stream(s) enter the plant through pipeline(s) and flow through inlet separation equipment, which separates separable inlet condensate from produced/slop water from the gas. The gas stream from the liquids separation equipment flows up through the triethylene gycol (TEG) gas dehydration unit contactor. The dehydrated gas flows through the propane based gas refrigeration unit, which lowers the temperature of the gas and condenses/separates heavier (primarily butanes+) NGL components from the gas before the gas enters the cyrogenic NGL recovery unit.  Propane is used as the refrigerant in the closed cycle gas refrigeration unit, the the propane vapor stream is compressed by the gas engine/refrigerant compressor units.  The chilled gas from the propane based gas refrigeration unit flows through the cyrogenic NGL recovery unit, which significantly lowers the pressure and temperature of the gas, as well as removes energy from the gas, enabling lighter (primarily ethane and propane) NGL to be separated form the gas.  The separated NGL is stored in one (1) 27,000-gallon pressurized tank, and exits the site through pipeline(s).  The residue gas stream for the cryogenic NGL extraction unit is compressed by gas engine/gas compressor units before flowing offsite through sales gas pipeline(s).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hobart Ranch gas\n\nplant.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support\n\npersonnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment\n\nundergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before\n\nprocess piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing\n\nactivities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are\n\nin place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of\n\naffected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are\n\nperformed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. \n\nThis system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology\n\n(including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly\n\nreviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that\n\nadequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls\n\nhave not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating\n\nlimits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these\n\nchanges.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training\n\non the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nT"

      "SummaryText": "he Hobart Ranch gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could\n\nhave resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. \n\nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent\n\na recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings,\n\ndevelops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant\n\nmanagement for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's\n\nfindings and recommendations are tracked until completed.  The final resolution of each finding\n\nor recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees\n\n(including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are\n\nretained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\n\nrevalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Hobart Ranch gas\n\nplant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required\n\nby the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at\n\nleast every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel may participate as audit team members. \n\nThe audit team findings are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\n\ntaken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until completion.  The final resolution\n\nof each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Hobart Ranch gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\n\nsafe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential\n\naccidents that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release and (2) reduce the\n\nconsequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the\n\ncovered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\nA? Process relief valves that discharge to a vent stack\n\nA? Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\nA? Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n\nA?

Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\nA? Fire extinguishers\n\nA? Trained personnel\n\nA? Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. \n\nThere have been no releases of regulated substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, property or\n\nenvironmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  Also, there has been a decreasing\n\ntrend in the frequency of incidental releases.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Hobart Ranch gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect\n\nthe safety of workers and the public, as well as the environment.  There are no 112(r) threshold\n\ntoxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance,\n\nincluding the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire\n\ndepartment, and mechanisms for notification are in place.
