We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. The company/corporate policies are embodied in the numerous EHS and Engineering standards which apply globally. At Rohm and Haas Texas, these policies are implemented through the site and global EH&S programs.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have\n\ndesigned and implemented, including:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- Notes relating to our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from\n\noccurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n- The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\n- The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\n\n\nThe Lone Star facility produces a water based Acrylic Emulsion used in the Industrial Coatings Industry as well as some products used for paper coatings.  In the process, the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release are used.\n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nVinyl Acetate\n\nVA is received via rail car and is stored as a pressurized liquid in horizontal tanks capable of holding 200,0"

These PHAs were used to\n\ndefine the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional\n\nanalyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to\n\nprotect both our employees and our neighbors. They also help us target the most important equipment for\n\nmore frequent inspection.\n\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble\n\nshooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas. Operators are involved in writing,\n\nreviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\n- Training - Training is based on the operating instructions. Operators help determine the frequency of\n\nrefresher training.\n\n- Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that\n\nensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals. This system is being\n\ncontinuously improved.\n\n- Management of change - As an industry pioneer in the management of change, we have a comprehensive,\n\nwell-institutionalized MOC system. Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system\n\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified\n\nprocess is built as intended. It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are,\n\nindeed applicable to the process as built. PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\n\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed.

The updated quantities for both chemicals is due to the potential to store rail cars on-site. The updates reflect a maximum potential inventory.\n\n-Update 2: Section 2 Toxics Worst Case - The worst case release scenario is based upon failure of a rail car which is used to store acrylonitrile. The inventory in a rail car was increased from 180,000 lbs to 200,000 lbs because rail cars have the potential to hold 200,000 lbs as opposed to 180,000 lbs which is on the Bill of Lading. This estimate was updated to be more conservative. The release scenario was also updated to remove passive mitigation considered as a more conservative approach. Further, vinyl acetate was removed as a Worst Case Release Scenario as there is only one process and the off-site impacts of vinyl acetate is much less than that of acrylonitrile.\n\n-Update 3: Toxics: Alternative Case - The alternative case scenarios have been updated to reflect more accurate release rates as well as using dikes as the only passive mitigation.\n\n-Update 4: All section have been up"
