It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Underwood Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Pottawattamie County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Underwood, Iowa location is James Russmann, agronomy  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.\n\n                      James Russmann, agronomy manager\n                               WORK:    (712) 323-7167\n                               24-Hour:  (712) 323-6405\n                               Mobile:     (402) 681-5581\n\n                      \nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT FARM SERVICE COMPANY, UNDERWOOD, IOWA:\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and"

      "SummaryText": " distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1)  18,000-gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is three (3).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE  RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 18,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.6 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Towns of Underwood and Bentley and the unincorporated community of Peter, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially c"

Finally, Farm Service Company has extended to the Underwood Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFarm Service Company, Underwood, Iowa had a realease of 135 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia in August 2006.  The release was due to equipment failure.  The release did not cause death, injuries, property or evacuations or shelterings in place.  There was water that was contaminated and tested by the IDNR.  The water was then pumped out and applied to Farm Services property.  Farm Service has removed the hose and replaced it with a steel pipe to fix the problem.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Farm Service Company to immediately notify the Underwood Volunteer Fire Department and the Pottawattamie County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Underwood Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Underwood location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Underwood has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Pottawattamie County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNone."
