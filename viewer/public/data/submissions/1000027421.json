We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\r\n\r\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) organization, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nOur facility produces a number of products that include Propylene Oxide (PO), Styrene Monomer (SM), Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), Polyether Polyols (Polyols), and an assortment of products from the Butanediols (BDO) unit, including Allyl Alcohol (AA).  There are two POSM units, one MTBE unit, one Polyols unit, and one BDO unit.  These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nPropylene Oxide (PO): Approximately 35 million lbs. are on-site based on storage, production and use.  PO is the major product of the CVOS facility and is also a feedstock for the Polyols and BDO producti"

AA is a product produced in the BDO unit.\r\n\r\nEthylene Oxide (EO): Approximately 1.5 million lbs. are stored and used on-site.  EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols unit.\r\n\r\nAnnhydrous Ammonia (NH3): Approximately 140,000 lbs. of NH3 are stored on-site to be utilized in the control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) in the Utilities area. \r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nPropylene: Approximately 950,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is the primary feedstock for both of the PO units.\r\n\r\nPropane: Approximately 75,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propane is a chemical used in the manufacture of PO.\r\n\r\nMethylamine (MA): Approximately 925,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  The Methylamine is stored in an aqueous solution that is approximately 50% MA and 50% water.  MA is a feedstock in the BDO unit.\r\n\r\nEthylene:  Approximately 70,000 lbs. are contained in a pipeline and is used as a primary feedstock for the production of Ethylbenzene in the two POSM units.\r\n\r\nIsobutylene: Approximately 414,000 lbs. are contained in a surge drum in the MTBE unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Toxic Chemicals\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario Propylene Oxide (PO)\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for PO assumes the complete rupture of the largest PO storage tank at this facility, releasing 17,250,000 lbs. of liquid PO into a containment dike, and leading to a vapor cloud release.  Distance to the endpoint of this scenario was calculated using the EPA tables of 7.4 miles, and ultimately impacted an estimated 90,000 people.\r\n\r\nCredit was taken for the dike where the PO tank is located, reducing the immediate impact of the rele"
