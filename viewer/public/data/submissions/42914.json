      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary\n For \nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Facility\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Poultry further processing.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for our refrigeration process.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 16140.00 lb.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)].  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from our Further Processing Plant.  In this scenario 4964 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate in just over 1 minute.  The released quantity has been limited to 31% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as enclosure(s) and emergency manual power shut off are also taken into account to calcu"

      "SummaryText": "late the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of isolating and limiting the flow of ammonia through the system.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 3.0 m/s wind-speed, the maximum distance of 1734 yards is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 300 ppm.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from our Poultry Further Processing Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of ammonia and is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the flow of ammonia through the system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 300 ppm of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 596 yards.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What If\" scenario.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a "

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 6/4/2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n \nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at George's, Inc. Further Processing Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 2/23/2001.

Further Processing Plant.  The most recent review was performed on 6/12/2004.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 5/26/2004.  These audits are carried out at least once a year and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nGeorge's, Inc. Further Processing Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
