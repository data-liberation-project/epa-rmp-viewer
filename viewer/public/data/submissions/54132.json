      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Sun Valley Packing\n\nSun Valley Packing updated various sections of it's RMP/PSM to comply with update requirements. This included additional training, PHA Revalidation and Hazzard Assesment. \n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Sun Valley Packing are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Grower, packer-shipper and cold storage of Peaches, Necterines and Plums..  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is  Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and passive mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp?.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Refrigeration System.  In this scenario 25273 lb. Of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 55% of the maximum capacity of the source by  passiv"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Refrigeration System.  The scenario involves the release of 360.00 lb. Of .  Toxic gas is assumed to be released in an enclosed space in direct contact with the outside air for 30 minutes.This is typical for a compressor shaft seal leak.  Normal response time for manual isolation of a compressor would be less.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is just past the facility boundary.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSun Valley Packing maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/07/2009.\n\n"
