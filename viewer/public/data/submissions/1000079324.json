(PCS) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen, Ohio, L.P., plant is located at 2200 Ft. Amanda Road, Lima OH 45804. Adjacent to this facility is INEOS Chemical which provides security for this facility under an agreement with the parent company PCS Nitrogen. PCS maintains and trains an emergency response team to respond to emergencies.  The site also works closely with the local Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe primary activities at the PCS Nitrogen facility include production of anhydrous ammonia, urea, and nitric acid for agricultural and industrial applications. The plant's primary product, ammonia, is manufactured by combining natural gas and air. Ammonia is a key ingredient in the production of urea, nitric acid and for the production of acrylonitrile at the adjacent INEOS Chemical facility. We have two RMP-regulated toxic substances and two RMP-regulated flammable mixtures present at our facility. The RMP-regulated toxic substances are Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ammonia (greater than 20 wt% solution). The RMP-regulated flammable mixtures are natural gas (containing Methane, Ethane, Propane, Hydrogen, Butane, and Pent"

Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard this summary also addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen Lima plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access all information created as part of the plant prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that addresses each prevention program element. In addition the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Each p"

      "SummaryText": "rocess has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In production areas, documentation is available that shows safety operating limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition). The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e. automated shutdown systems). In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each PSM covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThis plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to pe"

      "SummaryText": "rform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, this plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists. The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management. Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nAlso safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, and (4) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the PCS Nitrogen plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant uses contractors to supplement its work force and also during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the "

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting. In addition, the PCS Nitrogen plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies"

In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant has a hot work permit procedure, which details those areas that require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required. A permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc. except in designated areas. The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plan"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe PCS Nitrogen plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the PCS Nitrogen plant periodically"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the PCS Nitrogen plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the PCS Nitrogen plant is coordinated with the Allen County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.
