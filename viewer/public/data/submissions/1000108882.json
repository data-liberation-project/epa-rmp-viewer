Topeka MSB Plant (Reser's Topeka MSB) refrigeration systems (North Bistro and South Bistro) use pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employees and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Reser's Topeka MSB to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n1.1.2.\tSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n1.1.3.\tWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Action provisions. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.2.\tFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\n1.2.1.\tReser's Topeka MSB is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods. This location has two systems within the confines of the same infrastructure, North Bistro System and South Bistro System. It is considered a co-located site as defined in 40 CFR part 68.3. The combined ammonia refrigeration systems maximum inventor"

We are using the data for the worst case and alternate scenarios of the South Bistro System due to it having a greater release and or impact potential.\n\n1.2.2.\tThis refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees only. Management personnel, visitors and contractors are accompanied by trained personnel of the refrigeration team.\n\n1.2.3.\tThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.4.\tThere is no standby make-up inventory kept on-site.\n\n1.3.\tThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n1.3.1.\tRelease scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA. Offsite receptors were defined using the Marplot Map Server. This system was used to estimate the residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  \n\n1.3.2.\tWorst-Case Scenario. Catastrophic failure (struck by) Recirculator and or pump located outside of the compressor room when filled to the greatest amount would release 11,142 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario presumes that the entire contents are released.  \n\n1.3.3.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 7,089.  Within this distance, there are many school, parks, and multiple businesses inside the release zone.\n\t\n1.3.4.\tThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) by physically compromising the tank.

It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 325 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure relief valves. The design specification of the tank only allows a maximum capacity of 80% at 95&#61616;F, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system. During high demand, the High-Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a fraction (~30%) of capacity. In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly. The worst-case weather scenarios are uncommon.  \n\n1.4.\tAlternative Scenario. \n\n1.4.1.\tSeveral alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1\" opening in a high-pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, pressure relief valve release, or an evaporator being struck. This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 6,350 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\n1.4.2.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.2 miles from the point of release. This distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass an estimated population of 3 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone.  \n\n1.4.3.\tThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes using appropriately placed isolation valves.
