      "SummaryText": "The Zellwood Station Co-Op has a drinking water facility that adds Chlorine for disinfection.  The total Chlorine on site at any given time is 300 lbs, which is stored in an enclosed building.  We have voluntarily turned in this RMP*Submit to describe the facility and its emergency prevention systems.\n\nThe system has leak detecting systems, vapor sensors, positive vacuum flow pressure, and positive vent fans.  The site is inspected annually by the Florida State Fire Marshal and Florida Department of Environmental Protection.  The last inspection of this type was July 1998, while the last maintenance inspection was in March 1999.  The emergency prevention plan was reviewed July 2nd, 1999.\n\nOperators hired by Zellwood must be licensed, and receive annual training and refresher courses.  The risk at this site is minimal, because the empty Chlorine tanks are switched out with full tanks by an outside company.  In the worst-case scenario of releasing all of the Chlorine within 10 minutes, the Chlorine would reach a maximum downwind length of 1 mile.  There have never, however, been any accidents on this site related to the drinking water facility."
