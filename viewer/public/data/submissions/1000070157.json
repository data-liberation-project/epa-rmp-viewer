In 1998 and again in 2012, additional equipment was installed to increase refrigeration capacity. The facility is located at 2621 W. 25th Street, Cleveland, OH 44109.\n\nWe are a food manufacturing facility which produces Minor's bases and custom flavor/sauce concentrates.\n\nMinor's products are used extensively throughout the country, in fine quality restaurants, healthcare facilities and in hotel & restaurant chains.\n\n\n\nThe L. J. Minor factory of the Nestle Professional Division, located at 2621 West 25th Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio uses two ammonia refrigeration systems to preserve and protect raw materials, intermediates and products.\n\nEvery effort has been made to limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia contained within this system so as to minimize the potential impact of catastrophic failures.  Facility process expansions, however, has resulted in present inventory levels.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the only chemical handled at the facility which is covered by the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\nL. J. Minor management are committed to the prevention of anhydrous ammonia releases that have the potential to adversely impact the health and safety of our employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors as well as sensitive receptors and ecosystems adjacent to the L. J. Minor facility.  To this end, L. J. Minor personnel have undertaken policies and procedures that: \n\nEnsures that employees know and understand the hazards of anhydrous ammonia through participation in all aspects of the L. J. Minor Process Safety Management (PSM) program; Documents, maintains and updates all process information relating to the ammonia refrigeration system; Identifies process upsets that could result in an unwanted release of anhydrous ammonia using the What-If/Checklist method for performing a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA);This PHA resulted in a number of recommendations that, w"

This is accomplished through the development of written operating procedures which identify potential upsets, alerts system operators to these potential upsets and provides safe methods for avoiding the serious consequences that can result; Ensures that contractors working on or near the ammonia refrigeration system are aware of the potential hazards and work responsibly to avoid potential anhydrous ammonia releases; Ensure that existing Safe Work Practices for hot work, confined space entry, lockout / tagout and controlling personnel access to the ammonia refrigeration system are adhered to by all employees, contractors and visitors; Ensures that safety-critical equipment is inspected and/or tested as required to ensure their continued safe and reliable operation. Where appropriate, periodic preventive maintenance is performed to ensure the ongoing reliability of all process equipment; Reviews any new processes or additions to the existing ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that they can be started up and operated safely; Manages changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to ensure that they are implemented in a manner that minimizes the potential for unwanted releases of anhydrous ammonia; Investigates all incidents associated with the ammonia refrigeration system so as to learn how they can be avoided in the future; Ensures that all employees, contractors, visitors and outside emergency service personnel know what to do in the event of an emergency so as to minimize potential injuries as well as off-site consequences; And, periodically audits PSM activities so as to ensure that PSM programs undergo continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nIn many years of ammonia refrigeration system o"

      "SummaryText": "peration, there have been no incidents that resulted, or could reasonably have been expected to result, in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility's written Emergency Response Plan provides for plant personnel to respond to any release of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system. Should they determine a need for HazMat response, they would notify a contracted off-site hazardous response team who is available 24hrs, 7 days a week. An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared to handle release scenarios that have potential impact on the surrounding community. A community notification plan would be activated if the release could affect the surrounding neighborhood. This plan was prepared in cooperation with our local fire, police and medical officials. \n\nIf the release expands into the surrounding community, a shelter-in-place plan would go into effect. \n\n\n\nAll plant emergency response personnel are identified within the written Emergency Response Plan and receive periodic training to ensure that they know and understand the hazards and how they can be avoided.  Copies of the plant's written Emergency Response Plan are provided to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), fire department, and other outside emergency service personnel as needed.\n\n\n\nWe at Nestle Professional recognize our responsibility as a company to actively address environmental concerns. It is our policy to utilize sound environmental and pollution prevention policies.\n\nNestle has committed resources to develop design specifications for our ammonia refrigeration systems in accordance with nationally recognized engineering practices to ensure safe operation of these systems. Our refrigeration personnel have been provided with state-of-the-art equipment as well as on-going training to be prepared to respond to accidental releases. Nestle factory personnel work closely with local emergency services to prepare for such events by conducting drills and maintaining "
