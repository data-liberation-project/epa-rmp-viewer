The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to oakland foods employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be met by using good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all oakland foods, L.L.C owned activities.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe oakland foods facility is a food processing and storage facility.  Raw materials are trucked to the facility and then made into various prepared meats (e.g., hotdogs, sausages, meatballs and bacon etc.) for restaurant, wholesale, retail and food service customers.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is used for cooling and freezing capabilities required for the processing and storing of the food product.  The cooling medium for refrigeration at this site is anhydrous ammonia (subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68) consisting of 90,504 lbs. which is used in a closed loop recirculating and recycling system.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program  \n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n* Employee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information:  Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the s"

The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a detailed description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis:  Formal studies using the What-If Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety as well.  Based upon potential hazards identified, recommendations have been developed to improve the safety of the system.\n\n\n\n* Operating Procedures: Written, detailed standard and emergency procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n* Training:  A training program has been developed which ensures that employees who operate the system are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n* Contractors:  All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices and all standard and emergency operating procedures.\n\n\n\n* Pre-Start-up Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed for their effect on the system as a whole.\n\n\n\n* Management of Change:  Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation:  Procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team.  Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility.\n\n\n\n* Compliance Audits:  Audits will be conducted at least every three years as mandated by OSHA Standard 29 CFR Part 119.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Acc"

The highest-ranking Plant Emergency Response Team Member will assume the responsibilities of Incident Commander until the Oakland Fire Department arrives.  The Oakland Fire Department will assume Incident Command and will contact the Council Bluff's HAZMAT Team for assistance and designate individuals to proceed with off-site evacuation of the surrounding community(s) if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe plant Emergency Response Team will stand by and be prepared to assist the Incident Commander and the Council Bluff's HAZMAT Team as needed within their level of certified training.  The plant Emergency Response Team will work as a liaison with the Incident Commander for the Oakland Fire Department and entry to any Hot Zone will only be as directed by the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\noakland foods, L.L.C. completes a thorough review of the ammonia systems each time a design change is implemented.  oakland foods, L.L.C. is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\noakland foods, L.L.C.
