The \r\nmixtures are used as propellant for aerosol paint cans.  The two processes \r\nare: (1) propellant injection into aerosol cans (the propellant process), and \r\n(2) finished goods warehousing.\r\n\r\nPropellant is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure and is stored in \r\nan 18,200-gallon water capacity storage tank at a pressure of \r\napproximately 70 to 80 pounds per square inch gauge (psig).  \r\nAdministrative controls in place at the facility, including written loading \r\nprocedures, limit the tank fill volume to 85 percent of capacity, resulting in \r\na maximum on-site propellant mass of 68,548 pounds.  The storage tank \r\nand transfer piping are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nFinished goods are transferred to the on-site warehouse for storage and \r\ndistribution.  Mixtures of propellant, flammable liquids, and paint solids \r\nare stored in 15- to 20-ounce cans.  Approximately 590,000 pounds of \r\npropellant may be stored in the well-protected warehouse at any one time.\r\n\r\nPropellant is a flammable and potentially explosive gas.  The propellant is \r\nnot inherently toxic.\r\n\r\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe True Value propellant filling system consists of the single storage tank, \r\npiping from the storage tank to a small propellant fill room, and two \r\naerosol can filling machines.  A pump is used to transfer the propellant \r\nfrom the storage tank into the propellant fill room.  The filling machine \r\nregulates the incoming pressure of the propellant and injects the \r\npropell"

The equipment and \r\ninterconnecting piping are part of a closed system, thereby minimizing the \r\npotential of a large release.\r\n\r\nThe propellant filling system is protected by specific safety systems and \r\nhardware which include safety relief valves, excess flow valves, and safety \r\ninterlocks and alarms.  Safety relief valves protect the storage tank and the \r\npiping to the propellant filling machine.  Excess flow valves are located at \r\nall inlet and outlet connections to the storage tank.  The excess flow valves \r\nclose if a larger-than-normal flow of propellant from the vessel were to \r\noccur.  Gas detectors and alarms within the filling room monitor the \r\nambient air to ensure proper operation of the system.  Abnormally high \r\nconcentrations of propellant within the propellant fill room will actuate \r\nspecial exhaust equipment and, if levels continue to rise, shut down the \r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nOnce filled and packaged, cartons of aerosol cans are transferred to the \r\nfinished goods warehouse.  In the warehouse, the cans are stored in a fully \r\nsprinklered rack system until they are shipped off site.\r\n\r\nPropellant filling is accomplished in a closed system.  Historical releases of \r\npropellant have included only small volumes infrequently released from \r\nthe filling machine inside the propellant fill house.  While these incidents \r\ncan impact employees, they have not historically lead to a release that \r\nwould result in a potential off-site impact.\r\n\r\n2.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of propellant at the True Value Cary \r\nfacility in the last 5 years that have resulted in death, injury, or significant \r\nproperty damage on site or off-site death, injury, property damage, \r\nevacuation , sheltering in place, or environmental damage site.\r\n3.0    PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n3.1    PROPELLANT PROCESS\r\nTrue Value has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of \r\npropellant, such as the aforement"

The \r\nmajor objective of this prevention program is to implement a management \r\nsystem that prevents releases of propellant, especially in situations that \r\ncould expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The program \r\nemploys a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process including \r\nprocess design, process technology, process changes, operational and \r\nmaintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and \r\nprocedures, emergency preparedness and procedures, training programs, \r\nand other interrelated elements that effect the propellant system.\r\n\r\nThe key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n  Process safety information regarding the propellant system has been \r\ndeveloped, documented, and made available to facility operators.

      "SummaryText": "tten standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used to provide the \r\nbasis for proper and safe operation of the propellant system.  The \r\nSOPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, \r\nemergency operation, and emergency shutdown.\r\n\r\n    Formal authorization systems are in place to ensure that system \r\nchanges or expansions are as safe as the original design, and that an \r\nindependent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the \r\nengineering design and can be safely operated prior to startup.\r\n\r\n    Operators and mechanics working in the propellant fill building or \r\nwho are responsible for unloading propellant from tank cars receive \r\ntraining on the process hazards, process safety information, SOPs and \r\nemergency response actions related to the propellant system.  The \r\ntraining program ensures that the operators understand the nature \r\nand causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to \r\nincrease awareness of the hazards particular to the propellant system.\r\n\r\n    A mechanical integrity program has been implemented and includes:  \r\n(1) routine system inspections to identify unusual or increasing \r\nvibration, incipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or \r\nfailures; (2) replacement or testing of pressure relief valves on the \r\nstorage tank every 10 years; and (3) periodic testing of gauges, \r\nmonitoring devices, and safety interlocks.\r\n\r\n    Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame \r\nproducing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, grinding), the \r\nwork must be approved by executing a written hot work permit to \r\nverify precautions have been implemented to prevent fire.\r\n\r\n    Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the propellant \r\nsystem are pre-qualified based on their knowledge of propellant \r\nsystems and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\r\n\r\n    All incidents that cause or might have caused an accidental or \r\nunexpected release of propellant ar"

This program considers that employees who work on \r\nthe propellant system are the most knowledgeable about it and are \r\nbest able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or \r\nimprovements which enhance safety.\r\n\r\n3.2    FINISHED GOODS WAREHOUSE \r\nAlthough a formal, documented prevention program is not required by \r\nthe RMP rule for Program 1 processes, a number of design and operational \r\ncontrols are in place to decrease the severity or prevent the occurrence of a \r\nfire or explosion.  The most significant controls are described below.\r\n\r\n    The warehouse is designed as an aerosol storage area per the NFPA \r\nManufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products (NFPA 30B).\r\n\r\n    The rack storage system is designed for flammable materials storage \r\nper the NFPA Code for the Rack Storage of Material (NFPA 231C).\r\n\r\n    Potential sources of ignition are restricted from the warehouse.\r\n\r\n     The warehouse and rack system are fully sprinklered.\r\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe True Value, Cary facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency \r\nAction Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the \r\nfacility, including incidents related to a release of propellant.\r\n\r\nThe EAP includes awareness and response training for plant employees, \r\ncoordination with the local fire department, and evacuation of personnel \r\nin the facility.  The EAP identifies specific individuals and their \r\nresponsibilities, and identifies procedures for emergency medical care.\r\n\r\n5.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY"

      "SummaryText": "The prevention program that is described in Section 3.0 of this Executive \r\nSummary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, \r\nevaluate, and reduce the potential for a propellant release and/or a release's \r\nimpact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and \r\nequipment.  As safety improvements are identified by the management \r\nsystem they are evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented.  For \r\nexample, the facility may implement the following changes to further improve the safety of the process:\r\n\r\n* Additional training,\r\n* Periodic repair and replacement of equipment, and\r\n* Continued implementation and improvement of the PSM program."
