Ammonia is used in a closed loop process to freeze finished frozen and breaded fish portions and other frozen portioned products.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed to follow established Codes and Standards when it was built.  This ensures safe design of the ammonia refrigeration system and its installation.  Following existing Building, Mechanical, Fire and Electrical Codes and Standards, the refrigeration systems' engineering design, materials of construction, procedures for proper installation of equipment by trained installation contractors, and testing piping and equipment safeties was performed on the system at installation.  Automatic devices protect against critical system upsets such as high levels, high pressures, and high temperatures.  There is a maintenance program at the facility used to document the testing, inspection, and maintenance of the refrigeration system and its components.  Training is provided and documented verifying operators are qualified to operate the system.  In addition, training is provided for emergency operation following written operating procedures.  An annual HAZWHOPER certification and refresher class is provided to key personnel in the facility.\nThe facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.
