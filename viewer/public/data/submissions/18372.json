(Duke Facility) are committed to safe operations and prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility will work with local Fire Departments, the LEPC, and Emergency Management Coordinator to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of a release on the community and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n     The primary function of the Facility is the storage and retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers in the surrounding area.   Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored on-site at this facility would be 84,118 pounds in the 18,000 gallon capacity tank (based on 56% filling density).\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO:\n     The worst-case scenario would be the release of 84,118 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in 10 minutes; distance to the toxic endpoint for this toxic gas would be 1.27 miles, using the DEGADIS Model and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.  The Alternative Scenario would be the release of 5,954 pounds per minute for a duration of 2 minutes, based on transfer hose failure;  distance to the toxic endpoint is .60 miles, using the DEGADIS Model, and assuming \"agricultural\" terrain.  Affected population is estimated to be 400 people under either scenario.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n     The Facility has implemented and is in compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68; ANSI K-61.1;29 CFR 1910.111; 40 CFR Part 355, Emergency Planning and community Right To Know.\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that (a) have caused any deaths or significant property damage at the facility nor (b) to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place procedures, property damage or environmental damag"

The Facility has provided the LEPC and other authorities/agencies the emergency planning information as required under SARA, Title III.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n     Safety improvement is a continual process at this facility; periodic inspections and evaluations determine thestatus of working conditions, and identify possible changes for incorporation into this process.  There are no changes identified at this time specific to this process.  Discussion of safety issues, latest regulatory changes or requirements, and group discussion of areas/issues of concern or interest are incorporated into monthly safety meetings, as well as training sessions."
