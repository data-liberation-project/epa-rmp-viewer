One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a Program 2 or 3 process that exceeds threshold quantity while only one ARS analysis is required for all flammable substances as a class.  For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n \nAlternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fenceline.  Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nElm Grove Gas Plant Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammables\n \nA single ARS for the flammable mixture is required under the ARP Program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for the flammable mixture as follows.  Seal failure on the transfer pump at the tanker truck loading area causes a release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 200 psig  and a temperature of  1000F.  The release is assumed to continue for ten minutes.  The flammable mixture will vaporize and may ignite a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. \n \nIt was determined that a 10-minute release would involve 1,800 pounds of the flammable mixture.  Using the trinitrotoluene equivalency formula from the OCAGD,  it was determined that a release of  this amount of a buoyant gas in a rural area would result in an ARS endpoint distance of  0.10 miles. \n \nElm Grove Gas Plant Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Toxics\n \nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.

In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nThe company also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Reliant Energy Field Services, Inc. (REFS) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nREFS operates the Elm Grove Gas Plant located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.  The location of the facility is illustrated on Figure 1, a 7.5 minute United States Geological Survey (USGS) map.  The Elm Grove Plant is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquified petroleum gas (LPG), a mixture of pentanes, hexanes, C5+ compounds, by refrigeration and pressure.  The LPG and condensate is transported from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Elm Grove Gas Plant is a Program 2 process. \n\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n \nREFS identified one tank containing a regulated flammable substances and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest single vessel quantity stored.  It was determined that the LPG storage tank exceeded  threshold quantity. The identification of this exceedance in"

A WCS analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process while only one WCS analysis is required for regulated flammable substances as a class.  WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.0 meters per second (2.2 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 25:C (770F).  Topography for WCSs are distinguished between rural and urban.\n \nFlammable Substances\n \nRegulated flammable substances or mixtures containing flammable substances include both gases and volatile liquids.  The WCS assumes that the total quantity of a vapor cloud is released and detonates.  The endpoint for a WCS involving a regulated flammable substance or mixture is an over pressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  For a regulated flammable substance, consequence distance determination is based on its heat of combustion.  For regulated flammable mixtures, the component with the highest heat of combustion can be used for consequence distance determination or, if preferred, directly calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAGD).  The quantity of a regulated substance/mixture used to determine distance to endpoint is the largest quantity of a regulated substance/mixture in a single vessel.\n \nThe LPG is a mixture of pentanes, hexanes and C5+ contained in a pressurized liquid storage vessel having the capacity of approximately 13,535 gallons (71,026 lbs.).

      "SummaryText": "of identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel is released to the atmosphere, forming a vapor cloud.  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this mixture represents the facility's worst-case scenario for flammables. \n\nPentane, the major component of the LPG, was identified as having the highest heat of combustion (44,697 kjoules/kg).  It was determined that its use would provide a more conservative consequence distance.   The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable liquid mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.33 miles.  The distance to endpoint is greater than the distance to public receptors.  The Elm Grove Gas Plant is, therefore, classified as a Program 2 process under the ARP Program.\n\nToxic Liquids and Gases\n \nToxic gases include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25: C, 770F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration.  For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.  For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids. The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid in Appendix B of the OCAGD in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively.\n\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Elm Grove Gas Plant primarily uses the what if study to perform these evaluations. The what if method uses questions that postulate mistakes in operations or failures of equipment.  Based on the answers to the questions, consequences and preliminary recommendations can be determined.\n\nThe PHA findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Elm Grove Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of  completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
