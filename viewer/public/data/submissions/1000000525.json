KFO consists of three adjacent, but not contiguous, operating areas - the Kennewick Area, Hedges Area, and Finley Area.  The Hedges Area is currently on standby and all chemical inventories have been removed.  KFO facilities are located on the west bank of the Columbia River with open fields, industrial neighbors, and rural residences in the general area.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought into KFO by railcar and stored in atmospheric storage tanks, pressurized spheres, or cylindrical tanks.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored for resale, transferred via pipeline for processing into nitric acid, and A?conversionA? into aqua ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is also mixed with nitric acid in a process called a neutralizer to produce an intermediate stream of 83% ammonium nitrate that is further processed into liquid fertilizer solutions.  Sales of anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia are typically in tanker truck load quantities picked up by wholesale vendors at the facilities.\n\n\n1.  KFO accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nKFO has management policy statements at the Corporate and plant management level endorsing the practice of all necessary measures to maintain safe operations.  Operating personnel are authorized to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to responds to an emergency.  KFO has an emergency response plan with detailed response procedures.\n\nKFO also has a series of Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide detailed instructions for safely conducting operational and maintenance tasks and activities.  All of the above documents, in their latest version, are available to all employees electronically on the KFO Intranet.  Any procedure can be printed to be used as a guide for a specific task.\n\n\n2.  KFO regulated substanc"

KFO accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe KFO Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Administrative Procedures (APs), Safe Work Practices (SWPs), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) implemented at the facility for anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes & systems, equipment, and related activities and the general loss control program represent the facilityA?s main active commitments to our accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n4.  KFO five-year accident history    2005 A? 2009\n\nThe RMP requires a five-year history of all releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nKFO Kennewick Area has had no significant events involving regulated materials in the previous five-year period.  KFO Finley has a single event where a non-employee doing field work on a nearby ACOE pump station reported throat irritation due to smelling ammonia the previous day.  His reported time corresponds with a flare outage and ammonia release.

KFO has designated personnel as defined by the Incident Command System (ICS) to respond to emergencies.  The management structure based on the ICS is adaptable to incidents of any scope or magnitude.  The KFO emergency response management structure is designed to accommodate any type of incident.  The plantA?s designated emergency responders are trained to take emergency action in response to hazardous material incidents to stop, contain, and control releases.  If warranted, outside emergency services shall be called to provide assistance, and if needed, the services of an outside response contractor will be used.\n\nThe A?Spill & Release Reporting GuideA? outlines the reporting procedures in the event of a chemical release to the air, ground, ground waters, or to the Columbia River from KFO.  This guide is located on the KFO facility Intranet and is accessible by all KFO employees through any of the facilities computer station"
