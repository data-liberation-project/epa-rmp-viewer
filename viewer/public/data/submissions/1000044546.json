The Corporate Compliance Team assists the facility in administering safety and environmental policies. The Corporate Compliance Team is made up of the following personnel:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSenior Director of Corporate Refrigeration\r\n\u00bf\tCorporate Manager of Refrigeration\r\n\u00bf\tSenior Manager Environmental Compliance\r\n\u00bf\tPSM-RMP Regulatory Manager\r\n\u00bf\tCorporate Manager of Facilities Compliance\r\n\u00bf\tOSHA Regulatory Manager\r\n\r\nThe Maintenance Manager periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Chester facility serves as a refrigerated warehouse and storage facility. The facility is located at 1 Elizabeth Lane in Chester, New York about 0.75 miles west of Highway 6 and 0.5 miles south of Highway 94. The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 35,200 pounds of ammonia for various dock operations and cold storage areas. There was a facility expansion in 2003 which added eight evaporators to the refrigeration system.  There was an additional facility expansion in 2010 which added 35 evaporators to a new warehouse area, 2 high stage compressors, and a new Recirculator vessel with pump package within the engine room, and 3 new evaporative condensers on the roof. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels, compress"

The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\r\n\r\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\r\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\r\n\r\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Chester to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Chester's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed design"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  There are two Manning ammonia sensors placed in strategic locations in the Compressor Room. In the event of ammonia detection, an alarm is triggered on the control system, and at the facility (audible on high level), and the ammonia refrigeration technicians are notified via an autodial system. The New Warehouse addition is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout the cold storage areas.  These detectors are also programmed to autodial.  In addition, C&S Wholesale Grocers personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases during the past five years of operation (June 2009 - June 2014) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is included in the facility IIPP program.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Chester Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\r\n\r\nThere is a specific Corporate C&S program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the traini"
