The Facility Policy\n\nOwners Joe and Kathy Sims, along with the employees of Sims Fertilizer & Chemical Co., are dedicated to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. In the unfortunate event of an accidental release, this facility is prepared to work with the local agencies, or other authorities, to rectify any accidents that may occur.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility reported on is the storage of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application at this facility. We do not do any blending of fertilizers.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at this rural facility is 18,000 gallons.\n\n3. Examples of our worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario can be found in our enclosed RMP submit.\n\n4. Sims Fertilizer & Chemical Co. has implemented provisions from both \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5. We are happy to report that we have been accident-free for the last 5 years.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility has developed an emergency response plan with the aid of Regulatory Consultants Inc. This response plan has been reviewed by all employees. Copies of this plan have also been provided to local authorities.\n\nState and local authorities have been provided with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nSafety improvement is a continuous process at this facility. Evaluations are performed periodically to maintain safe working conditions. At this time there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations."
