In the past five years we have had no incidents involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that meet the reporting requirements set forth in the program.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nEnergy Transfer Spindletop facility is a member of the Jefferson County LEPC & Mutual Aid.  The facility emergency response plan which details procedures for accidental releases and includes notification of the Jefferson County LEPC & Mutual Aid as well as the Energy Transfer Nederland Fire Brigade.  We maintain an open door policy with local emergency response organizations to help ensure maximum understanding and cooperation during an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Energy Transfer Spindletop facility personnel continually strive to improve all aspects of our safety programs to protect our workers and the public. The following is a list of ongoing improvements that we are implementing at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\na.\tSafety upgrades on the Ethylene Dehydration system.\nb.\tFlare system upgrade project. \nc.\tCreating a Mechanical Integrity program upon completion of the above-mentioned projects."

The facility utilizes certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  \n\nThese safety precautions include:\n1.\tEffectively managing our process operations;\n2.\tInvesting in the latest process safety technologies, training, and retraining our personnel;\n3.\tReviewing our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n4.\tEnsuring safety is considered in process design, installation, operations, and maintenance.\n\nThe facility maintains a policy to be a good business partner; a safe and conscientious neighbor; and to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Energy Transfer Spindletop facility RMP regulated flammable substances identified at the facility is Ethylene (C2 H4). For identifying the maximum release quantity for use in determining potential off-site impacts, it is assumed that the entire contents of the vessel or the system are released to the atmosphere, forming a vapor cloud. Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule and the calculations provided by RMP*Comp it was determined that Ethylene (C2 H4) present in the Vertical Molecular Sieve Adsorber, V-6210 represents the facility\u0092s worst-case scenario for flammables. Calculations for all three vessels containing regulated substances were performed to determine end points and are provided in Scenario Modeling.\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Plant Supervisor has overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  However, all personnel ensure that safe work practices, equipment design specifications, and maintenance schedules are adhered to thereby reducing the probability of an accident at the facili"
