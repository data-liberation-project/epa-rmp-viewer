(AGA) facility located in Canton, Ohio complies with NFPA requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or propylene storage/handling system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe AGA facility stores propane in two 1,800-gallon above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  The facility also stores propylene in three 1,000-gallon ASTs.  Propane and propylene are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane and propylene storage/handling process consists of two 1,800-gallon propane ASTs and three 1,000-gallon propylene ASTs,  cylinder filling equipment, filled cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential failure of one 1,800-gallon propane storage tank filled to 80% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each storage tank to 80% of capacity at 60\u00b0F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, May 24, 1996, the distance to the flammable endpoint (1 psi overpressure) was determined to be 0.1 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case release scenario include commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities and residential property.  The residential population within this 0.1-mile radius is approximately 88 persons, which was estimated using an Environmental Data Resources - Offsite Receptor Report.\n\n4.  The al"

      "SummaryText": "ternative release scenario:\nThe alternative release scenario for the AGA facility considers the potential release of propane from a 100-pound capacity storage cylinder (i.e., caused by a cylinder being knocked over resulting in the cylinder valve being broken off), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The release rate of propane from the cylinder was estimated to be 1.67 pounds per minute.  It was assumed that the release occurred for a duration of 60 minutes.  Therefore, the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 100 pounds of propane.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the flammable endpoint was determined to be 0.02 miles.  The only affected public receptors under this alternative release scenario are commercial facilities.  There is no residential population within this 0.02-mile radius.\n\n5.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThe AGA facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The propane and propylene systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law at the AGA facility in Canton, Ohio.\n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\nThe AGA facility has never had an accident involving its propane or propylene storage/handling processes.  \n\n7.  The emergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving our propane  or propylene storage system, it is AGA's policy to immediately notify the Canton Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  We have communicated this policy with the Canton Fire Department.  All employees have access to AGA's emergency action plan, and emergency action training is conducted annually.  \n\n8.
