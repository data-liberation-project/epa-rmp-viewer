By preventing pollution at the source, we strive to achieve cost savings, increase operational efficiencies, improve the quality of our products and services, maintain a safe and healthful workplace and improve the environment.\n\nRisk Management Program\n\nThis facility is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule under the Clean Air Act of 1990.  The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP.  The Program requirements include submission of a Risk Management Plan, a hazard assessment defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, development of a process accidental release prevention program and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the KNC Greenwood Terminal in Greenwood, NE.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Greenwood Terminal began in 1973.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The ammonia stored at this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal is a storage facility for ammonia consisting of a 30,000-ton atmospheric pressure, refrigerated liquid storage tank with a dike for secondary containment, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.\n\nAmmonia is the only substance regulated by the EPA?s RMP rule that is used or stored at KNC?s Greenwood Terminal.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\n\nIt is KNC?s corporate policy to eliminate accidental releases of any substance, particularly hazardous and regulated materials.  Consistent with KNC policy, the contract employees of this facility are also committed to the prevention"

Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this facility, the safety of its employees and the community.\n\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, KNC is committed to the following:\n\n?    A knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained contract employee group\n?    A well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n?    Implementation of a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) and Prevention Program\n?    Continual review and improvements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n?    Excellence in safety programs and practices, and a superior safety and accident record\n?    Planning, preparation and training for emergency response\n\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal has had a written Emergency Response Plan in effect for many years, as required by the RMP and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules.  The response plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and emergency response agencies.  On behalf of KNC, the contract personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the facility.\n\nContract employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and appropriate response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal process is subject to the OSHA PSM Rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This rule has required the facility to establish an accident prevention program for this process which is equivalent to that required for Program 3 processes under the EPA?s RMP rule.\n\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in processes that handle, use, and store or process hazardous materials.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of facility activities.\n\nThe Greenwood process o"

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the ?worst-case? scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under the ?worst-case? should not be considered a ?public danger zone?.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is release that is more likely to occur than the ?worst-case? release; however, as with the ?worst-case?, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-case Toxic Release ? Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.  Direct liquid contact to the skin can cause severe burns.\n\nKNC has considered potential ?worst-case? releases form the refrigerated liquid, atmospheric pressure storage tank which is passively mitigated by a secondary containment dike.\n\nKNC?s hypothetical ?worst-case? scenario involves an anhydrous ammonia release from the facility?s 30,000 ton refrig"

As required by the rule, the ?worst-case? release assumes that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical ?worst-case? event dictated by the rule and is extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and substantially reduces the probability of such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release ? Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical ?worst-case? tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as in areas where refrigeration, loading and other transport activities occur.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the facility.  Also, operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of liquid relief valve on the product heater.  The valve is assumed to fail and release ammonia for one (1) minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the publicly available model (DEGADIS), which shows that the impact of the release would extend offsite under typical ambient conditions.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Preventi"
