The facility functions as a storage location for the fertilizer used by farmers in the area to grow the crops which provide high-quality, low-cost food for families around the world.\n\nFacility Snapshot\n\nAnnual volume of 40,000 tons of anhydrous ammonia is put through the KNC facility that has been supplying farmers in eastern Nebraska and western counties in Iowa for about 26 years.  As a storage facility the Greenwood location provides a vital link in the chain of KNC inputs.  Ammonia, produced at KNC\u00bfs nitrogen manufacturing facility in Enid, OK, is shipped to the Greenwood Terminal by pipeline where it is stored until needed by local farmers for their fields. \n\nImpact on the Community\n\nWith an annual budget of over $400,000, KNC provides a considerable economic benefit to the Greenwood community.  KNC is committed to customer service and the facility is available to service farmers as needed throughout the year.\n\nEmployee Snapshot\n\nKNC contracts the operation of the facility to Williams Ammonia Pipeline, Inc.  The contractor\u00bfs 8 full-time employees provide years of experienced service to the area cooperatives.  Major maintenance projects for this facility are performed by KNC maintenance personnel.  These KNC employees are trained in all aspects of facility maintenance including electrical and mechanical troubleshooting.\n\nPollution Prevention Policy\n\nKNC is committed to protecting the environment and preserving our natural resources for future generations.  We pledge to eliminate or reduce our use of toxic substances and minimize our use of energy and the generation of all wastes to the extent technically and economically feasible.

The RMP Rule requires facilities handling threshold amounts of certain substances to develop a RMP.  The Program requirements include submission of a Risk Management Plan, a hazard assessment defining possible offsite impacts of certain regulated substance release scenarios, a five-year accident history, development of a process accidental release prevention program and an emergency response program.\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for the KNC Greenwood Terminal in Greenwood, NE.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nInitial construction and operation of the Greenwood Terminal began in 1973.  Several changes, additions and improvements since that time have resulted in the current design of the facility.  The ammonia stored at this facility is used as agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe Greenwood Terminal is a storage facility for ammonia consisting of a 30,000-ton atmospheric pressure, refrigerated liquid storage tank with a dike for secondary containment, a product heater, refrigeration compressors and assorted vessels and piping.\n\nAmmonia is the only substance regulated by the EPA\u00bfs RMP rule that is used or stored at KNC\u00bfs Greenwood Terminal.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program\n\nIt is KNC\u00bfs corporate policy to eliminate accidental releases of any substance, particularly hazardous and regulated materials.

The impact of these potential releases must be quantified in accordance with release criteria dictated in the rule.  The projected impact distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide a conservative estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to the EPA, the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf should not be considered a \u00bfpublic danger zone\u00bf.  Possible causes or the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\n\nThe alternative release scenario definition is release that is more likely to occur than the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release; however, as with the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf, the alternative release improbability is not taken into consideration.\n\nWorst-case Toxic Release \u00bf Ammonia\n\nAmmonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor and is one of the most widely used industrial chemicals.  It is prepared industrially from natural gas, steam and air.  Some of this ammonia is used for direct injection into croplands as a fertilizer.  A large amount of industrial ammonia is reacted with carbon dioxide to make urea fertilizer or reacted to make ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  Ammonia is also frequently used as a refrigerant for the storage of perishable foods.\n\nAmmonia vapors can be irritating to the nose, throat, eyes and skin.

As required by the rule, the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf release assumes that this entire quantity is released as a result of a catastrophic failure of the tank and subsequently evaporates from the diked pool.  This unlikely event was modeled with a publicly available model (DEGADIS) and the resulting end point distance is expected to be conservative.  The impact of this release scenario is predicted to extend beyond the facility boundary and impact public receptors.\n\nWe believe this scenario is a hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf event dictated by the rule and is extremely unlikely to occur for many reasons.  In addition to the stringent design controls for this type of storage vessel, facility maintenance and inspection programs address the integrity of process and storage vessels, including this one, and substantially reduces the probability of such massive and unlikely failures.\n\nAlternative Toxic Release \u00bf Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nMore likely release events than the hypothetical \u00bfworst-case\u00bf tend to concentrate in areas where the ammonia product is handled, such as in areas where refrigeration, loading and other transport activities occur.  Generally, significantly lower quantities are involved due to numerous shutdown safeguards present throughout the facility.  Also, operator intervention tends to mitigate and limit the consequences of failures.\n\nThe hypothetical ammonia alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia due to the failure of liquid relief valve on the product heater.  The valve is assumed to fail and release ammonia for one (1) minute before employee intervention stops the release.  The impact of such a release was modeled with the publicly available model (DEGADIS), which shows that the impact of the release would extend offsite under typical ambient conditions.\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the facility, which is facilitated by the Preventi"
