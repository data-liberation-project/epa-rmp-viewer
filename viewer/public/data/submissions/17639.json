      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \nThe City of Edinburg Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  \n\nThe City of Edinburg Water Filtration Plant is located at 500 E. Mahl, in Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas.  The chlorination building at the Water Filtration facility consists of a ten-foot by ten-foot room with two 1-ton chlorine containers located next to the building facing north.  The room is located on the south side of the facility. One 1-ton cylinder is operational and the other one is used as backup.  The chlorine containers have manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency and a chlorine alarm will be triggered if a release occurs.  Emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is manned 24-hours a day, and operators check the chlorination building daily.  Self- Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office and workroom located approximately 100 ft. and 200 ft. away from the chlorination building, respectively. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Water Filtration Plant includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (chlorine): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has "

The toxic endpoint is defined by the EPA as 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine.

The calculations were performed with the CAMEO and RMPComp32 models as provided by USEPA and NOAA.
