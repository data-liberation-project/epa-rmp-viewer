The wastewater treated at LCWRP originates mainly from approximately 370,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with aqueous ammonia addition, chlorination, and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent that is suitable for re-use and/or discharge.  Aqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) is used in the disinfection process.  \n\nRMP Executive Summary Components\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, LCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  LCWRP?s aqueous ammonia handling process is subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 2 Requirements.  LCWRP?s chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 3 Requirements.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n?    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n?

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA?s Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe CSDLAC emergency response policy involves the preparation of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCP) for handling hazardous materials which are specific for each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the LCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency (County of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nRegulated Substance Information\n\nAqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) is used to maintain the disinfection limits in the treated effluent.  The aqueous ammonia is provided by delivery truck and transferred via hose to the ammonia storage tanks. Throughout the documentation, aqueous ammonia is referred to as being stored in storage tanks; the aqueous ammonia solution is actually stored in 30 psig design, ASME Code unfired pressure vessels.  There are three 4,880 gallon tanks at LCWRP.  The working capacity of each tank is 3,800 gallons, and each tank is provided with a high level alarm.

Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is received in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the building.  The chlorination system at the plant consists of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located at each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  All emergency shutdown valves can also be activated from the Plant Control Room. \n\nChlorine gas detectors are used to detect a chlorine leak in the bulk storage and chlorinator rooms.

The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\".\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 2 and 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  For the worst-case release scenario analysis, the following scenarios were considered: (1) rupture of one aqueous ammonia storage tank with a maximum capacity of 3,800 gallons, (2) rupture of one chlorine tank with a maximum capacity of 18-tons, resulting in a release of 36,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration, and (3) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with a maximum capacity of 17-tons, resulting in a release of 34,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a 10-minute duration.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia tanks are located within a diked area.

The release rates for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were thus estimated to be 662 pounds per minute and 625 pounds per minute (lbs/min), respectively.  The released gas/liquid (i.e., either chlorine or sulfur dioxide) is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine/sulfur dioxide vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) that disperse in the atmosphere.  Ammonia vapor from an evaporating pool does not form a denser-than-air cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for aqueous ammonia was estimated using an average of results obtained from the SLAB and ALOHA dispersion analysis models and EPA?s Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP for aqueous ammonia is 200 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is also the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (108 deg F), and average relative humidity (74%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.

Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers. Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the aqueous ammonia, chlorination, and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no aqueous ammonia, chlorine, or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the LCWRP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgment.  The following alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis: \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the ammonia system involves the transfer of the ammonia from the delivery truck to the tank.  A breach in the 20 foot transfer hose with an inside diameter of 2 inches is used as the alternative release.  In addition, the delivery truck operator or supervising facility personnel is assumed to have a reaction time of 60 seconds, at which point the emergency shut-off switch will be activated to stop the aqueous ammonia release.  Hence, the amount of aqueous ammonia released is equal to the volume of the hose as well as the amount released during the operator?s reaction time.  The amount released during the operators? reaction time is equal to 60 seconds multiplied by the fill transfer pump flow rate of 100 gpm.  It was estima"

These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the storage tanks.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination buildings.  It is assumed that a maximum of sixty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remotely-controlled shutoff valves installed on the flex hoses.\n\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 87 lb/min.  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.003 lb/min. The sulfur dioxide release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 56 lb/min.  However, the sulfur dioxide release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.01 lb/min.  Since the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPA?s SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  \n\nThe meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 61 deg F, and average humidity of 74%.  The results of the aqueous ammonia dispersion modeling analysis were calculated based on the average of the SLAB and ALOHA results.  The results indicated that the maxim"

The results of the SCREEN3 dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one-hour average concentration for chlorine and sulfur dioxide would be less than 0.1 ppm (0.01 ppm for chlorine and 0.03 ppm for sulfur dioxide).  These concentrations are significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide scenarios are highly unlikely because the flex hoses are inspected and pressure tested every two years. \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nLCWRP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements. LCWRP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements: \n?    Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\n?
