Risk Management Program Rule (40 CFR 68) for stationary sources with over 2500 pounds of chlorine gas in the process (level 3).\n\nThis program addresses storage, handling and transfer of chlorine gas to minimize the potential for a chlorine release in a municipal water treament facility located at 175 North Main Street, Yuma, Arizona 85364. The Plan was developed by employee participation and builds on the OSHA required Process Safety Management Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and Standard Operating Procedures; and includes the five year history and worst case and alternative case scenarios.  Other participants in the RMP process include employees of the Yuma Fire Department, and members of the City of Yuma's Environmental Advisory Alliance .\n\nThe City of Yuma is committed to the safety and protection of human health and the environment while serving our community.  In the history of the Yuma Main Street Water Treatment Plant, there has been no record of a chlorine emergency.  To maintain the safety at our facilities and for our community, the Public Works Department has developed procedures, documentation, design and engineering controls, on-going training and program monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan contains information on the level 3 program, as described in EPA standard 40 CFR 68.  The documentation consists of the required components for reporting. The steps taken to obtain the information include: performing a hazard assessment, developing or documenting existing programs for management of systems and change, prevention, emergency response, and worst and alternative case scensarios.\n\nAlong with this executive summary, are a five year history of accidents, an off-site consequences analysis including worst case and alternative case scenarios, a "

Dialogue with local public safety agencies will incorporate the findings of the Risk Management Plan.  Plant modifications will be based on their impact on the safety of the chlorine process, system, subsystems, and equipment.\n\nThe written program will be implemented through teaining and on-going employee participation in evaluation and implementation of the Risk Management Plan.  The information will be readily available to employees and local emergency agencies in notebook form containing the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management Plan, and the EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\nSome of the problem areas identified while developing our Process Safety Management Plan have been set on a time line for correction.  A listing of these items includes the following. 150 pound chlorine cylinders stored on the loading dock, open to vandalism and weather mishaps.  A Lack of maintenance procedures to preserve the upkeep of the chlroine process regularly.  A lack of a fire alarm system in the control building.  PVC piping exposed to sunlight.  An unfavorable intake system.  Lack of monitoring loading and unloading techniques. An MSDS file which was not regularly maintained. Lack of emergency situation drills with the loacl emergency response agencies.  A lack of training for all contractors working on or near the chlorine process.\n\nMany of the items noted above have already been addressed and corrected, and there is a time line for addressing the rest.\n\nThe written Risk Management Plan will be "

Water treatment plant employees should know what type of evacuation is necessary and what their role is in carrying out the plan.  In some cases, where the emergency is grave, total immediate evacuation of nonessential employees is necessary.  In other emergencies, a partial evacuation of others may be necessary for continued plant operation.  In some cases, only those employees in the immediate area of a fire may be expected to evacuate or move to a safe area such as when a local application fire suppression system discharge employee alarm is sounded.  Employees must be sure that they know what is expected of them in all such emergency situations which have been planned in order to provide assurance for their safety from fire or other emergency.\n\nThe Emergency Action and Control Plan contains the information needed to implement this program.  In most emergency cases at the plant (and involving the chlroine process) the Yuma Fire Department will be responsible for performing rescue and medical duties.  The Fire Department and Hazmat Team are also capable of handling all major situations which may include fire, first aid, chemical spill or release.\n\nIn April 1999, a chlorine safety drill was conducted utilizing employees and resources of the plant and Public Works Department, along with the Yuma Fire Department and Hazmat Teams.  The results and findings of this exercise have led to changes"
