Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers of agricultural chemicals. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct apllication as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. the maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds, which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm) of dispersion based on the modeling is 2.6 miles.\n\nThe altenate case scenario would be a release from the rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose with 26,600 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm would be 1.6 miles.\n\nThe facility complies with the Rules and regulations of Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship with respect to the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. These regulations reference ANSI Standard K 61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111.\n\nThere has been one accident on-site in the past five years from the release of anhydrous ammonia, but there were NO off-site impacts.\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required u"
