Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Illini FS-retail division of GROWMARK, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Sangamon Valley Fire Department, Champaign County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 1009 CR 3000 N, is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1 - 18,000 gallon and 1 - 30,000 gallon storage tanks, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 600,000 pounds, this includes the amount of andydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Code Title 8 Part 215 Anhydrous Ammonia, Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, And Storage Facilities, which is based upon Compressed Gas Association's (CGA) American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (6th edition), commonly referred to as ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of"
