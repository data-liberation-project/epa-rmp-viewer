      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC facility is a chemical warehouse and distribution facility located and headquartered in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is part of Brenntag North America, Inc.  Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC is an advanced distribution company providing customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  Major operations are located in the Midwest and employ approximately 200 people.\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag) facility, located in Wauwatosa Wisconsin, is a chemical warehousing and distribution facility.  One of the chemicals stored at the facility is Toluene Diisocyanate ? Mixed Isomers (TDI).  The TDI storage process is determined to be Program 1.  The largest TDI cylinder is 250 gallons (2,500 lb) capacity.  These cylinders are pressure rated ASME vessels; they are equipped with pressure relief valves; and they are stored in an unventilated room within the warehouse.  A failure of more than one cylinder at a time would be highly unlikely and would not trigger the RMP threshold requirement of 10,000 lbs.  However, in the event of a catastrophic failure, it must be assumed that all cylinders stored in the room could release into the contained room.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario for this process requires a catastrophic event such as a fire or building collapse, which would cause all the TDI cylinders stored on-site to leak into the contained storage area and volatilize.  Secondary containment curbing and ramps limit the maximum pool size.  The calculated distance to the toxic endpoint is 31 feet.  The distance to the nearest property line is approximately 190 feet.\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to manage those products throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process"
