      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nIntel has a comprehensive Environmental, Health, and Safety Program that addresses all aspects of the life cycle of its processes, facilities, and products. Its Process Safety/Risk Management program described here addresses how Intel manages the risks associated with high hazard chemical processes to prevent accidental releases, fires, or injuries related to process upsets with high or catastrophic potential. Intel's advanced processes are consuming higher volumes of some hazardous gases than previous process technologies. To accommodate increases in demand, without increasing exposure risk, Intel utilizes industry standard DOT ISO module/trailer and Isotainer/trailers and bulk cryogenic supply tanks to provide process gas delivery, replacing smaller industry standard cylinders. Doing this will increase the overall volume of the gas delivery package, but it will also greatly reduce projected package change frequency at advanced process factories by as much as 25X. It is well known in the gas industry that it is the package change which represents the highest risk for potential release. Intel has conducted numerous hazard assessments in conjunction with the ISO module and Isotainer supplier's and our Architectural and Engineering (A&E) consultant. This included conducting numerous HazOp studies, consequence analysis on numerous scenarios, and a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in order to determine the risk management and control strategies. The following describes the comprehensive Process Safety and Risk Management Program elements for these high hazard chemical systems.\r\n\r\nSAFETY IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT DESIGN\r\nToday's semiconductor facilities utilize a multitude of hazardous materials, (e.g. toxic, corrosive, pyrophoric, flammable, etc.) materials. These materials are inherently hazardous, sometimes in small quantities, and therefore safety engineering is required to contain the hazard, reducing the risk to meet"

The risk management and control of these risks starts by integrating EHS systems into the procurement and installation of process equipment, facilities design, safe commissioning, and pre-startup safety process of these new facilities. Intel's EHS requirements for the procurement of process equipment are primarily driven to the front of the supplier chain through the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturers Institute (SEMI) guideline process, an organization that develops standards for its members. EHS requirements such as SEMI S2 (safety), SEMI S8 (ergonomics), and S10 (risk assessments) are just part of the \"S\" series of SEMI guidelines intended to define these industry safety standards for process equipment. In addition, Intel-specific requirements are included to address other risks. These include combustible material restrictions to reduce fire risk and environmental characterization and emissions requirements to control and manage our site environmental permitting requirements for air, waste, and water emissions.\r\n\r\nAfter the procurement of process equipment, it must be installed and integrated into facility systems. To accomplish this, EHS has integrated its requirements into the process equipment installation standards. This includes ergonomic clearances for safe maintenance and operation, ventilation, spill control, gas detection, and all EHS aspects related to how the process equipment is installed. After these requirements have been established for equipment installations at the Technology Development (TD) site, they are transferred via the Master Design Package, which documents how all process equipment is installed at high volume manufacturing sites.  \r\n\r\nSemiconductor process equipment is supported by larger facilities systems that perform gas distribution, bulk chemical delivery, and waste treatment. Intel EHS requirements are integrated into the design of this equipment through the Intel EHS Facilities Equipment Procurement Proce"

This starts with outlining process safety expectations early in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request For Quote (RFQ) from each supplier, and ends with the final design of the equipment.\r\n\r\nProcess equipment and facilities equipment must all reside within the walls of the actual fabrication facilities. Intel EHS has integrated its requirements through the EHS Master Design Standard (MDS). The EHS MDS defines the requirements and expectations for the fabrication facilities. This standard is used to support the multitude of codes, standards, and regulations that drive the design of our facilities.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\nAll new facilities systems utilizing high hazard chemicals have a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted to assess the upset conditions the equipment may present, the controls in place, and the adequacies of these controls to prevent events with high or catastrophic potential. This process incorporates a 3 step approach:\r\n\r\n1. An initial process hazard analysis (hazard evaluation) is required on all new chemical facilities systems regardless of applicability to OSHA PSM or EPA RMP. One the following methodologies are utilized to determine and evaluate identified hazards of the process:\r\n\u00bf\tWhat-If Checklist;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Mode Effects Analysis; OR\r\n\u00bf\tHazard and Operability Study (HAZOP);\r\n\r\n2. Conduct consequence analysis (dispersion modeling) of credible release scenarios identified in the PHA. The goal is to have adequate safeguards in place to prevent an impact to the local community.\r\n\r\n3. After the PHA is conducted, a Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA) is conducted on all severe/catastrophic release scenarios (including any potential off-site impacts) to ensure that the controls are sufficient to meet the internal Corporate Risk Tolerance Criteria.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\r\nAfter the integration of EHS requirements into the procure"
