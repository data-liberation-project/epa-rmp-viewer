This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place. TE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) Plan, SPCC/FRP, and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed plans have a minimum of annual training requirements in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. Annual training is also a good time to discuss any situations at the facility the occurred over the previous year that the helped the plant gain knowledge on how to better address chemicals or spill practices. New employees are required to undergo training on the plans listed above prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. If job duties warrant, new employees may also be required to read through the plans, as well. TE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will follow the applicable procedures outlined in the SPCC/FRP, Industrial SWPPP, and H&S Plans to respond to, contain, clean-up, and properly dispose of the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nTE is located in Casselton, Cass County, North Dakota. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of grain. The regulated substances stored at the facility are aqueous ammonia (ammonia in concentrations greater than 20%) and a flammable mixture (natural gaso"

The worst-case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, creating a toxic liquid release.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of the RMP backup documentation file at the facility, detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model results are also provided as part of the RMP backup documentation file at the facility.  The ammonia tank sits within a concrete berm; however, passive mitigation was not included as part of the scenario.  Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth.  Swan Creek and un-named tributaries to Swan Creek are located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \r\n\r\nFlammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural Gasoline is stored onsite as denaturant in order to denature ethanol prior to shipment off-site.  Natural gasoline is stored in a steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A facility-specific SDS was used to determine RMP applicability, which is included as part of the RMP documentation file at the facility.  The denaturant contains multiple reportable constituents; therefore, assumed Pentane as the entire quantity. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint, the model results are also p"

In addition, the TE facility has implemented an OSHA PSM program at the facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nTo date, there has not been a reportable accident onsite involving the covered process.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nTE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan, OSHA PSM Program, and Facility Response Plan - which includes an Emergency Response Action Plan detailing evacuation and response procedures for spills/releases, etc.  The Plans listed in this Executive Summary have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards, as necessary.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nTE will continue to provide training programs to ensure the safety of employees, contractors, and the general public."
