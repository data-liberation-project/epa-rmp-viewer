The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane. Butane is stored onsite at a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs for blending into gasoline.  The equipment which handles butane includes piping, storage - (2) butane spheres, and pumps. The maximum inventory for the system is 16,774,193 lbs of butane.  Previously, the facility's storage tanks consisted of (4) bullets and (1) sphere.  A recent project was completed that removed the (4) bullets from storage and added an additional sphere equivalent in size the other sphere.  The changes to storage did not create a change to either the worst case or the alternative cases.  The total inventory did increase.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nThe East Houston Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. If an emergency were to occur, it is Magellan's policy to notify the East Houston LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\r\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The facility complies with the Federal and State require"
