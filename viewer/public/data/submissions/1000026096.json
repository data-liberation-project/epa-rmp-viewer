Security is specifically addressed through a security and vulnerability assessment (SVA)  performed under the the ACC guidelines.  The SVA was verified by the Phoenix Police Department to ensure effectiveness.   \n\n\n\n1.1      Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes as identified in Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with engineering controls, aministrative controls and industry best practices.\n\n\n\n1.2      The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and delivered to the final user location.  There is no chemical reaction involved, and neither is there any transfer of product from one container to another.  \n\n\n\n1.3      The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\n\n\nAir Products employs a number of administrative controls to limit the potential and magnitude of releases.  Foremost has been the decision to limit regulated substances to storage only.  Further, Air Products segregates material to"

The facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release.
