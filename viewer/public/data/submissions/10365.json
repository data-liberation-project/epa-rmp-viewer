      "SummaryText": "This facility, named Keys Fertilizer Service, located at 13338 N 1900th St, Paris, Il. 61944, is a retailer of chemical and fertilizer. We have 1 large anhydrous ammonia tank which holds 140,200 lbs. of ammonia when full. This ammonia is pumped into smaller anhydrous wagons holding approximately 4,000 lbs. each and sold to area farmers. We also have 2 propane tanks on sight, (one holds 12,000 gal and one holds 18,000 gal). This is used to heat the facilities. Our worst case toxic scenario depicts a liquid spill and vaporization. With a release of 20 lb. for ten minutes, a wind speed of 1.5 miles per hour, the anhydrous will travel approximatly 2.5 miles. This will effect approximately 30 residentual individuals. No other facilities would be affected. No passive mitigation is considered. Our toxic alternate release scenario is a pipe leak. 7,127 lbs. of ammonia could be released for a durations of 2 minutes.  At a 3 mile per hour wind speed this would travel .68 of a mile affecting 2 residentual people and no other environmental receptors. No passive or active mitigation is considered. Our flammable worst case and alternate release scenarios due to the propane storage is figured from the EPA's RMP guidance for propane users and small retailers. The worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion releasing 44,000 lb. propane. This can travel .3 miles affecting 2 residentual people. No other environmental receptors effected  and no passive mitigation considered. The alternate relese scenario is a pull away explosion releasing 69 lb. of propane traveling a distance of .03 miles effecting 2 residentual people. No other environmental receptors within distnace to end point and no passive or active mitigation considered. There have been no reportable accidents with in the last five years at this facility. There are no program level three proccesses at this facility. This facility complies with all applicable state, federal, and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it i"

      "SummaryText": "s our policy to call 911 immediatly, thereby notifying the Edgar County Fire Departments and requesting that they respond. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and they tour this facility yearly. The Illinois Department of Agriculture performs  inspections seeing that we are in compliance with the anhydrous ammonia regulations. We have identified the major hazards of anhydrous being toxic release, over pressurization, corrosion, overfilling, and equipment failure and the major hazards of propane being fire, explosion, overpressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure. The process controls in use for anhydrous and propane are relief valves, check valves, manual shut offs, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices. There are no mitigation systems or monitoring detection systems in place for either anhydrous or propane. Training for anhydrous safety is done in the classroom and on the job by demonstration and observation. Training for propane is done on the job by observation and demonstration."
