Plains management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Claremont Terminal is owned by Plains LPG Services, L.P. and operated by Plains Marketing Canada, L.P.  The terminal was purchased from Rymes Gas Supply which operated under the retail exemption from RMP and PSM.  At the facility, we receive liquefied propane gas (LPG) via railroad tank cars.  The received LPG is into any of six 90,000-gallon or six 30,000-gallon pressure tanks.  From these pressure vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Claremont Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Plains.  These high standards include:\n\n? Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n? Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that uninten"

Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n? Correcting any non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Claremont Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents since Plains purchased the facility.  It is reported by previous owners that no significant accidents occurred at the facility in the past five years as well.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  \n\nThis terminal is protected by a pneumatic shutdown system.  Compressed air is plumbed with plastic tubing that will melt in a fire causing activation of the ESD system. The Emergency Shutdown Valves [ESVs] are forced open with approximately 45 psig air. In the event of an emergency, pressing any of the ESD valves at the terminal closes the ESVs by dumping the stored pressure that holds them open. There are ESVs installed on the inlets and outlets of each tank and the railcar off-loading arms and associated piping.\n\nEach of the tanks inlets and outlets are equipped with Excess Flow Valves.  If an LPG leak or a piping break occurs downstream of the valve, the valves will close when the gallons per minute settings are exceeded.\n\nThere are also shut down buttons (electric) that shut down the pumps and compressors by disconnecting the electrical power to this equipment in the event of a stated ?Emergency?.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAs indicated above, there have been no chemical release accidents within the last five years that resulted in onsite injuries, death, or property damage or offsite impacts."

      "SummaryText": " \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has composed an emergency response plan and is working to coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the terminal with the Claremont Fire Department.  Also potentially involved in emergency response for the facility would be the New Hampshire State Police, the New Hampshire Environmental Services Department, and the Claremont Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The Claremont Terminal Manager is responsible for interacting with these emergency response groups.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n \n? The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to the process equipment or procedures are considered.\n? The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n? The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n? Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n? On-going coordination of the facility response plan with those of the town and county."
