This commitment is demonstrated by our dedication of staff and resources to our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and self-audits.\n\nThe Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant is rated to treat up to 6 million gallons per day of potable water production.  The facility provides water to the cities of Lugoff and Elgin and other areas within the county. In order to provide water that is free of harmful bacteria and pathogens, chlorine, considered potentially toxic by the US EPA, is used as a disinfectant for the water.  It is the facility\u00bfs policy to adhere to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations related to the safe handling of chlorine. \n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at the plant is 4,000 pounds (lb.) or two one-ton containers.  This is larger than the threshold quantity for this chemical as listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  Ammonia, also regulated by 40 CFR Part 68, is stored at the plant in an amount less than the threshold quantity.  As a result, this RMP only addresses chlorine at the Lake Wateree facility.\n\nThe Lake Wateree facility has had no major chlorine releases or accidents in the past five years.  \n\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the South Carolina OSHA program.  The elements in the program include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, maintenance, audits, incident investigations, management of change, pre-startup reviews, contractors, employee participation, and hot work permits.  Addressing the requirements of each element provide the foundation of the LEWA Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant\u00bfs accidental release prevention program.  The program is integ"

The building\u00bfs walls and ventilation system help contain any chlorine gas that may leak from the containers.  As part of the recently completed plant upgrade, a chlorine scrubber with associated equipment and ductwork was installed to mitigate any consequences of a chlorine release.  The scrubber system is designed to capture and neutralize a chlorine release up to 2,000 pounds in quantity.  Additional chlorine leak detectors and automatic controls were added as part of the facility upgrade.\n\nLEWA has established a program to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas. The prevention plan, presented in the Risk Management Program, consists of procedures and training designed to prevent accidents, including:\n\u00bf  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\n\u00bf  Employee Training \n\u00bf  Preventive Maintenance Program (Mechanical Integrity)\n\u00bf  Accident Investigation and Documentation\n\u00bf  Compliance Audits\n\u00bf  Process Safety Information\n\u00bf  Process Hazard Analysis\n\u00bf  Management of Change\n\u00bf  Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\u00bf  Use of Contractors\n\u00bf  Employee Participation\n\u00bf  Hot Work Permits\n\nThe LEWA Lake Wateree Water Treatment Plant has an emergency response program in place to enable the facility to effectively respond to a chlorine release, minimize injuries, lessen the impact to the surrounding community, and provide guidance to emergency response personnel.  The operating staff is trained to respond to chlorine releases with established procedures on seeking outside assistance as needed, public notifications, etc.  The LEWA has coordinated an emergency response plan with the following agency:\n\nLugoff Fire Department\n892 Highway 1, South\nLugoff, SC 29078-9345\n803-438-2911\n \nThe offsite consequence release analyses for the worst-case release and alternative release scenarios were performed using EPA\u00bfs"

The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  At the plant, the worst-case release scenario is the complete release of one 2,000 lb. container of chlorine over a 10-minute period.  This type of catastrophe is extremely unlikely and would possibly require the complete failure of the container to occur.  The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 3.0 miles.  The population within the area of the 3.0 mile radius circle is estimated to be 1,070 people.  Public receptors within the 3.0 mile radial distance include schools and churches.\n\nTwo alternative release scenarios were modeled to represent circumstances that were estimated to be more likely to occur at the plant.  One alternative release scenario was estimated to involve the release of chlorine from one of the six fusible plugs on a one-ton container.  Most one-ton containers have \u00be-inch NPT fusible plug openings.  In this scenario 1390 lb./minute of chlorine was assumed to have been released as a gas from a \u00be-inch diameter opening, for a total release of the entire container in less than three minutes.  The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 1.2-mile.  The population within this area is estimated to be 110.  Public receptors within the 1.2 mile radial distance include a church and a school.   Environmental receptors were not identified.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario was assumed to involve the total release of 1,500 lb. of chlorine gas at a rate of 150 lb./minute for 10 minutes from a \u00bc-inch diameter hole (such as a rust hole) on the side wall of a one-ton container.  The model determined the distance to the toxic endpoint to be 0.4 mile.  The population within this area is estimated to be 25."
