      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRinchem Company, Inc. (Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe \n\nprocedures.  Its committment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n      \"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the\n       environment.\"\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management.  Rinchem \n\nis a member of the National Association of Chemical Distibutors(NACD) and meets or exceeds all aspects \n\nof the NACD Responsible Distibution Process program for the safe handling and storage of chemicals. \n\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nRinchem's Chaparral Chemical Warehouse at 511Highway 213 stores chemicals for industry.  There is \n\nonly one substance regulated under 40 CFR part 68 - 70% hydrofluoric acid - that is stored above the \n\nthreshold quantity at this facility.  The hydrofluoric acid is not involved with any processes at this location \n\nother than handling and storage of closed drums.   \n\n\nRinchem is located in an isolated rural setting with very few nearby residential neighbors.  The Chaparral \n\nWarehouse was built taking into consideration fire codes, building codes and industry standards for \n\nwarehouses that store hazardous materials.  There are many features designed into the building that help \n\nto prevent a release of any of the stored substances to the environment such as secondary containment \n\nat the docks and dikes in the rooms where the materials are stored.  The materials in the warehouse are \n\nsegregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe modeling of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios was performed using EPA's RMP COMP \n\nprogram which is a very conservative model.  \n\n\nThe worst case scenario consists of the largest vessel in the facility containing the r"

The passive mitigation \n\nsystem that is in place at the facility and considered for the modeling of the scenario is that material is \n\nstored in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.  The worst case of the contents of an \n\nentire drum being released is very unlikely because of the daily inspections that are performed in the \n\nfacility to verify that no drums are leaking, and the policy that any release is stopped and then cleaned up \n\nimmediately upon detection.\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario that was modeled was the same as the worst-case scenario of a release\n\nfrom a 55-gallon drum except it was assumed to take place in typical weather conditions.  This \n\nscenario was chosen because it would be the most likely situation that could occur.  The same mitigation \n\nmeasures were considered.  Because releases are cleaned up immediately, the chance of the alternative\n\nrelease having an offsite impact is very unlikely.  \n\n\nAccording to the conservative method used to do the modeling of the scenarios, the estimated distance to \n\ntoxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.4 miles, and for the alternative release it is 0.3 miles.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and \n\nstate regulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n     - having an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan for flammables at the facility \n\n     - having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n\n     - only accepting materials that are in Department of Transportation-approved containers\n\n     - segregating materials according to their hazard class\n\n     - having secondary and tertiary containment inside the building and around the facility\n\n     - limiting access "

      "SummaryText": "to the facility\n\n     - performance of daily inspections of the material handling equipment used in the facility\n\n\nThe facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and to \n\ndetermine if any of the containers in storage are leaking.  It is Rinchem's policy that any time a \n\nrelease is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained \n\ntechnicians.  Training is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and \n\ntrained workforce can prevent most accidents.  The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for \n\nall new employees as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and \n\nsupervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has never been a reportable accident involving hydrofluoric acid at this facility.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nRinchem has a comprehensive emergency response plan.  The plan includes evacuation and notification \n\nprocedures for the employees of Rinchem and for the public.  The facility is included in the written \n\ncommunity emergency response plan.  Our employees are fully trained to respond to any release related to \n\nthe materials stored on-site.  Rinchem's technicians and supervisors attend annual emergency response \n\nrefreshers where tabletop drills are performed, and facility orientation classes are held where evacuation \n\nplans and procedures are reviewed.  Facility-wide drills are also performed.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this time to address improvement to safety at our \n\nfacilities.  Rinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventative measures are \n\nadequate to keep its employees, the community and the environment safe.  However, we are committed to \n\ncontinue working our corrective action process to monitor and improve the safety of all operations."
