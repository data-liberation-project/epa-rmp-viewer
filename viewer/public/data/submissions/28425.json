If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.0  Facility Information\n\n?The Facility is a retail agricultural facility who's primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\n?Anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia will be received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\n?Anhydrous ammonia will be received by truck and stored in one 15,000-gallon and one future 18,000-gallon storage tanks (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process will be 144,200 pounds.\n\n?Aqua ammonia will be stored in four 50,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled will be 1,530,000 pounds of 24% solution.    \n\n\n3.0  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\na.  Anhydrous Ammonia Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios  \nThe worst-case release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 78,642 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by regulations.  The alternative release scenario based on the PHA (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe with an increased wind speed and ?D? stability modeling parameters. \n "

The alternative release scenario based on the PHA (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a pipe break modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters. \n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia:  The Facility will implement the provisions of the ?Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, ?Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders?; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.?\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Maxwell Facility is a new operation; therefore, there have been no accidental releases or near misses of anhydrous ammonia or aqua ammonia.\n\n6.0  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is being developed in accordance with the following regulations:\n\n?OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\n?OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\n?Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\n\n7.0  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement will be an on-going process at the Facility.  Periodic evaluations will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific changes to the anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and regulated pesticides processes at the Facility will be implemented as needed."
