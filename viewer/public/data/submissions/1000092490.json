As a result, OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. has developed and manages environmental, health and safety (EHS) programs to prevent release and injuries and impacts to the surrounding environment.  As part of this effort, a Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP) program has been developed to ensure the process using a highly hazardous chemical is operated in a safe manner and prevents releases to the facility and the environment.  \n\n\n\n2. OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. processes fruits and vegetables to produce quality frozen fruits and vegetables sold to customers.  Refrigeration is used to freeze our products and uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  This refrigerant is stored in a secure, restricted area where access is limited to authorized personnel.  \n\n\n\n3. OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 to ensure that the highly hazardous material is properly maintained in the process.  The PSM program, which serves as the basis of our Prevention Program, includes the 14 elements required by PSM including process safety information, mechanical integrity, operating procedures and process hazard analysis.  Established Mechanical Integrity procedures are followed to perform preventative maintenance, inspections and repairs on a routine basis by trained technicians to ensure the integrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Our Management system, 5-Year Accident History, and off-site consequence analysis are RMP elements included in the Prevention Program.  The refrigeration system is equipped with numerous automated monitoring and safety devices to detect and mitigate operating conditions not within specifications.  Numerous automatic, remote and manual valving and shutoff systems can also be used when necessary to prevent releases to the environment.  \n\n\n\n4. OPC A"

An Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed in accordance with RMP requirements (40 CFR 68).  The ERP includes response actions to numerous emergencies such as fires, severe weather and ammonia releases.  OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. has identified emergency response teams for responding to various emergencies, evacuating employees and coordinating with local emergency officials.  OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. works with its local emergency services to coordinate facility updates and training.  If a release is identified, the Walkerville Area Fire and Rescue (WFR), Oceana County Emergency Management Agency (OEMA) and Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) will be notified and will work with the AFCWCS Emergency Coordinator and emergency teams to mitigate hazards and provide medical attention to those in need.  \n\n\n\n6. OPC Arbre Farms, LLC. is continually developing recommendations for improvement as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions.  Data from these recommendations are discussed and implemented if data shows that changes are necessary to maintain system integrity.  \n\n"
