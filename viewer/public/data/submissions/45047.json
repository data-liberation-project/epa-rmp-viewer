This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 255 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the hose break.  The simulation calculated that 10,147 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.

Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\r\n\r\n* Process safety information\r\n* Process hazard analysis\r\n* Operating procedures\r\n* Training\r\n* Mechanical integrity\r\n* Management of change\r\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - PSSR\r\n* Compliance audits\r\n* Incident investigation\r\n* Employee participation\r\n* Hot work permit\r\n* Contractors\r\n\r\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\r\n\r\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
