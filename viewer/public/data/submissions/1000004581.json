This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00c2\u00bf\tIntroduction;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tArmour-Eckrich\u00c2\u00bfs policies to protect health, environment, and safety.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u00c2\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tArmour-Eckrich Meats Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Armour-Eckrich; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.
