      "SummaryText": "The Central Compressor Plant (CCP) is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Extraction. A prior applicability analysis determined the CCP was not covered by RMP due to the naturally occurring hydrocarbon exemption of the natural gas entering the facility. It was recently recognized that the lean residue gas returning to the CCP from the Central Gas Facility (CGF) is post natural gas processing and, therefore, does not meet the definition of a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture.  As such, the volume of lean residue gas at the CCP is subject to the threshold determination requirements of 40 CFR ?68 and the gas quantities within the facility have been determined to exceed the thresholds for a flammable mixture due to the current compression pressures.\n\n\n\nDescription of the included process and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe CCP receives raw gas separated from crude oil at the Prudhoe Bay Unit flow stations and the gathering centers.  The raw gas flows through two CCP inlet separators and is then directed to the CGF, where it is treated via two low temperature separation/refrigeration processing trains to produce a lean residue gas.  The lean residue gas is then routed back to CCP where seventeen (17) compressors driven by fifteen (15) turbines compress the gas in two stages to approximately 4,250 psig for injection into the gas cap of the Prudhoe Bay reservoir.  The CCP can compress and inject approximately 7.5 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day.\n\n\n\nGas Compression System:\n\n\n\nAfter natural gas liquids processing at the CGF, the lean residue gas routed back to CCP first undergoes low-stage compression which raises the gas pressure from approximately 600 psig to 2,300 psig.  After the gas has been cooled by a series of fin fan coolers, the gas is further compressed to 4,250 psig and then cooled again.  The resultant high pressure gas is then routed from the CCP to three gas injection drill sites where it is injected into the "
