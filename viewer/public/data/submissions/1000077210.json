A Program 1 plan for both the propane refrigeration process and NGL/MI process is being submitted.\n\n\n\nDescription of  stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nCGF is designed to improve overall field gas off-take by recovering natural gas liquids (NGL) and miscible injectant (MI) from the gas and then (together with the Central Compressor Plant [CCP]) compress and return the remaining residue gas into the gas cap of the Prudhoe Bay reservoir.  The NGL and MI products are captured from the feed gas stream using a refrigeration/condensation process.  Current production is approximately 60,000 barrels per day of NGL with a portion of that production shipped to Kuparuk oil field for MI injection.  The remaining NGL production is blended with crude oil and sent to Pump Station 1 (operated by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company).  Approximately 350 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd) of MI product is produced for use in the Prudhoe Bay oil field.  When compressed and re-injected into the oil bearing formation, MI lowers the viscosity of the crude oil, allowing it to flow to the well bore more easily.  The overall effect is a significant increase in recoverable oil.  \n\n\n\nPropane Refrigeration and Manufacturing System\n\n\n\no CGF utilizes propane in a refrigeration system.  The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop.  Liquid propane is generally manufactured at CGF, stored in the 19-1218 refrigerant storage drum and added as make-up to the 19-1216 surge drum as needed.  The propane refrigerant system includes the following equipment and approximate inventories:\n\n\n\no The 19-1218 refrigerant storage drum provides liquid propane storage for make-up. The storage drum has a design liquid volume of approximately 124,351 gallons (2,961 bbl) @ 4.23 lbs/gal = 525,888 lbs.\n\n\n\no The 19-1216 refrigerant surge drum provides liquid propane sto"
