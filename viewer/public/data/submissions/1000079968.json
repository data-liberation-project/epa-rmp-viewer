Emergency Response Actions;\n5. Emergency Equipment;\n6. Emergency Response Training;\n7. Incident Command System; and\n8. Plan Review and Update.\n\nGill's Onions emergency response procedures serve as a guide for emergency control staff, company personnel, emergency assistance groups and law enforcement agencies that may be called upon to participate in controlling an emergency within the facility and surrounding areas. These procedures include employee notification of emergencies and evacuation procedures for emergency situations.  The facility is equipped with windsocks to help determine safe evacuation routes and staging areas.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n1.\tProcess Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n2.\tCompliance Audits;\n3.\tRoutine inspections, tests & maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n4.\tIIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections (IIAR minimum safety criteria for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration process);\n5.\tGills Onions Internal Inspection Protocols\n\nThe programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Where appropriate Work Orders are established in parallel to identified needs.  Current planned changes to improve safety include recommendations as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation/Update performed May 23, 2019.

Ensure that the solenoid valve is replaced and that the system is safe prior to start-up.\n\nRecommendation 3: It has been determined that the source of the ammonia leak was from a small hole in a solenoid plunger assembly on a malfunctioning/failed Hansen HA4AB defrost regulator associated with Blower 3 in Building 6. It is recommended to contact the valve Manufacturer, Hansen, to further investigate the reasoning for the failure of the solenoid valve.\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Program (ERP)\n\nGill's Onions has developed written emergency procedures to address elements that may be encountered during planning, responding or follow-up to an emergency at the facility. Application of the emergency procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans) within the emergency response element of the Risk Management Plan. The basic concept of Gill's Onions emergency procedures is to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies. The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nThe Plant does participate in emergency response activities under the HAZWOPER standard in a defensive manner only.  Plant employees are to implement hazard communications, provide for the safety of visitors and report to the established Evacuation Staging Area(s) for a head count.  Emergency response is coordinated with the City of Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  The Refrigeration personnel and/or other Management would be available to support the Fire Department as technical resources.  The facility has communicated with Oxnard Fire/CUPA to be included in the Oxnard Community Emergency Plan.     \n\nThe ERP is designed to be applicable to any type of emergency that may affect Gill's Onions and based on the concept that the elements of emergency response are similar, regardless of the hazard.

The accident occurred at approximately 9pm. The accident occurred when a solenoid coil had grounded to plunger tube and burned hole on post causing liquid ammonia to leak. The release was determined to be caused by the malfunctioning solenoid valve. The duration of the release was estimated to be 6 hours 18 minutes. The amount of ammonia released was estimated to be approximately 1,095.2 lb. The local CUPA, 911, CalEMA, and the National Response Center were notified. \n\nAn investigation was performed and the following recommendations were made and are being resolved:\n\nRecommendation 1: During the emergency response, there was confusion as to which agencies were required to be notified and what order the notifications should be made.

The ammonia is stored in an ASME-rated Pressure Vessel.  This process utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the capacity of a SCR for the Best Available Control Technology (BACT). The SCR system reduces NOX emissions by injecting ammonia into the exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix. Nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form nitrogen and water. The catalyst is comprised of a noble metal and works within a high temperature range for proper operations (800A\u00b0 F to 1100A\u00b0F). As such, the control efficiency of the SCR system is reducing NOX emissions to about 90 percent.  As described above, this system is offline. \n\n1.3 Summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe design of the Refrigeration & SCR systems along with the implementation of the Cal/ARP Level III Prevention Program (Process Safety Management or PSM) is specifically intended to provide assurance that the risks associated with ammonia are effectively managed.  Gill's Onions developed the facility Process Safety Management (PSM) Program pursuant to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines (i.e., 8 CCR A5189).  Gill's Onions first implemented the PSM program on June 18, 1999.  The elements of the Prevention Program are intended to be integrated with"

      "SummaryText": "1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Gill's Onions policy is to protect its employees, environment, property, and the general public from harm that may occur as a result of its operations. To achieve this end, Gill's Onions strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  With regard to the Ammonia Refrigeration and SCR Systems, the Accidental Release Prevention policy is to maintain compliance with the Risk and Process Safety Management Prevention Program elements.  The RMP/PSM programs are specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases; and to deal safely with emergencies if they do happen.\n\nGills Onions has adopted a Non-responding facility policy; Emergency Response pre-planning is coordinated with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA; and Facility Management.  Gills Onions has filed appropriate reports with the CUPA; measures have been taken to ensure the facility is included in the Community Emergency Plan.  The CUPA makes regular visits to the facility in accordance with California environmental regulations, which helps keep engine companies refreshed on Plant operations and layout.  The Gills Onions Emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall company policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public. Safety is the top priority.  Another priority is protection of the environment. Only after life, safety, environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n1.2 General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOxnard is located on the southern margin of the Oxnard Plain, approximately 5 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 50 miles west of Los Angeles, California.

The facility uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS 7664-41-7) in a closed-loop refrigeration process (18,000 lbs. maximum intended inventory) for temperature control of fresh onions.  Under a separate process, anhydrous ammonia is used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (300 lbs. maximum).  The SCR is used to control nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions from a one Mega Watt natural gas-fired turbine. The ammonia refrigeration system and SCR processes trigger the RMP requirements, both Federal and Cal/ARP. These processes were determined to be covered by Prevention Program III requirements.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the SCR Process was not being used; and the ammonia inventory in the SCR Receiver was negligible.  The facility however considers power backup essential to its business operations; this second Process will be kept on standby."
