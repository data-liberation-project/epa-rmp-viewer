      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for AVON:\r\n\r\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Kraft Foods facility in Avon, New York has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia).  This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This system uses a real time data base to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issues reminders to responsible groups.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Avon, New York Fire Department and the Livingston County, New York Emergency Planning Committee, in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0  Process Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKraft manufactures frozen whipped toppings and lunch combination products at the Avon, NY plant.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311999.  Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at Avon, NY plant - ammonia.  The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on site is approximately 95,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause burns.  The potential risk"

There are several key aspects of the prevention program:\r\n\r\n1. Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.\r\n\r\n2. There is a plant-wide ammonia detection system which alerts the utility personnel and security area personnel and both of these areas are staffed continuously.\r\n\r\n3. Most of the ammonia pipework is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n4. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures (monthly drills with the emergency response team and an annual drill with the Avon Fire Department and the LEPC).\r\n\r\n4.0 Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one accidental releases at this facility during the past 10 years, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\r\n\r\n5.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this facility has developed an emergency response plan, including, but not limited to steps to address the following topics:\r\n\r\n- accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste into the environment.\r\n- measures to be taken to prevent an accident\r\n- countermeasures to be taken in the event of an emergency\r\n- procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency measures to be employed for further protection of employees responding to the emergency, as well as other plant personnel.\r\n\r\nThis plan also incorporates the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasres Plan (SPCC), by reference, which includes information about the locat"

It also deals with training plant personnel who respond to spills and leaks anywhere on site.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the SPCC document is to also establish procedures to notify appropriate agencies (like the LEPC and the fire department) and company personnel in the event of an emergency.  It includes planning for potential spills and the appropriate responses and countermeasures.\r\n\r\nOur comprehensive emergency response plan is designed to protect our employees and the community and, among other things, requires that:\r\n     - All non-essential personnel immediately exit the area affected by the spill;\r\n     - Kraft immediately notify local officials, requesting their assistance, if necessary;\r\n\r\nFor a release that leaves the site, the company would work with the local fire and police officials to notify neighbors so that appropriate safety precautions could be taken.  If ammonia is in the outside atmosphere, the safest place to be is indoors with the windows and doors shut."
