NOTE: IN MAY 2017 THE GAS PLANT PROCESS 1 STORAGE OF LP GASES WAS REMOVED AND MOTHBALLED AND THE PLANT BYPASSED. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested inaccident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation,operation and maintenance of our gas processing facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Cogen Facility located near 19590 7th Standard Rd in McKittrick , California at Aera Energy's Belridge production field and Produces steam and electricity. The Cogen facility  produces electricity and steam from gas turbines and stores Anhydrous Ammonia for use in Nox reduction of Turbine exhaust. The Cogen facility's regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia which is used for Nox reduction in the turbine exhaust.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release incident at the Belridge Cogen Facility is a release of 50,000 lbs of anhydous ammonia in 10 minutes having release endpoint 4 miles . The alternative release scenario (ARS) is a transfer hose failure with a release rate of 695 lbs per minute with a distance end point of 0.26 miles. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the facility. Because processes at the Cogen are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation , they are also subject to Cal/OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.\n"

The management system defines for each program element the following:\n\n1. Purpose and scope of element\n\n2. Specific procedures\n\n3. Responsible and accountable personnel using a RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform) chart,\n\n4. Verification and measurement metrics\n\n5. Feedback mechanism\n\n6. Document locations for applicable documents\n\nThe management system is available for review at either facility.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Belridge Cogen encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as a part of the Belridge accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, Aera Belridge utilizes behavior based safety management (BBSM), an employee directed process to observe and review operations to assure safe behaviors are maintained and unsafe behaviors are corrected with peer feedback and corrective action plans.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Belridge Cogen keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configu"

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the management system.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. pressure, tank levels, temperature) in a key process parameter document.\n\n\n\nThe facility ensures that process is maintained within these limits using process controls, and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. The information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\n\n\nBelridge Cogen facility has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nAera's Section 32 Cogen Facility uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as wells accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from original design safety features, the facilities periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. The periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The Cogens 5 year PHA was conducted in 2015.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\n Aera Section 32 Cogen facility maintains written Operating and Maintenance procedures that address various modes of process operations. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Aera's facilities have implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nAera Energy uses contractors to supplement its workforce for specialized maintenance, inspection and construction activities. Because some of the contractors work on or near process equipment, Aera's facilities have procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant or LPG storage facility personnel of any hazards that they may find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Aera evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPRE-START UP SAFETY REVIEWS(PSSR's)\n\n\n\n Aera facilities conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service. The review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a energy control  procedure to ensure the safe isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE (MOC)\n\n\n\nAera has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: \n\n\n\n(1) ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, AND\n\n\n\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nAera promptly investigates all incidents which results in or could have reasonably resulted in a major accident which also includes near misses.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify causal factors and root causes, and then develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Aera uses the Taproot root cause methodology for this level of incident investigation."
