This commitment is demonstrated by the resources\r\ninvested in accident prevention, such as training personnel  and\r\nconsidering  safety in the design, installation, operation,  and\r\nmaintenance  of  our  processes.  Our  policy  is  to  implement\r\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated\r\nsubstances.  However,  if  a release  does  occur,  our  trained\r\npersonnel  will respond to control and contain the  release.  We\r\nalso work closely with our public emergency responders providing\r\nthem with training and equipment so that they can respond safely\r\nand efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe  Brady  Gas  Plant,  located 34 miles  South  East  of  Rock\r\nSprings,  Wy.  off  Highway  430 on  County  Road  26,  produces\r\npetroleum products (e.g., natural gas and condensate)  from  oil\r\nand  gas  wells. The Brady Gas Plant handles methane and  ethane\r\nwhich are regulated\r\nflammables. It processes approximately 65 million cubic  feet  a\r\nday  of  raw natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Brady  Gas\r\nPlant  does  not use, process or store a reportable quantity  of\r\ntoxic  regulated substances, although H2S below  the  reportable\r\nquantity is present in the process.\r\n\r\nHazard Assessment Results\r\n\r\nThe  Worst  Case  Scenario (WCS) associated with  a  release  of\r\nflammable  materials in processes at the gas plant  is  a  vapor\r\ncloud  (VCE)  involving the full inventory of the  Inlet  piping\r\ncontaining  22,399  pounds  of  a methane,  ethane  and  heavier\r\nhydrocarbon mix.

Examples of employee  participation  range\r\nfrom  updating  and compiling technical documents  and  chemical\r\ninformation  to  participating as a member of a  process  hazard\r\nanalysis  (PHA)  team. Employees have access to all  information\r\ncreated  as  part  of  the Brady Gas Plant  accident  prevention\r\nprogram.  Specific ways that employees can be  involved  in  the\r\naccident  prevention  program  are  documented  in  an  employee\r\nparticipation plan that is maintained at the Brady Gas Plant and\r\naddresses each accident prevention program element. In addition,\r\nThe  Brady Gas Plant has a number of initiatives under way  that\r\naddress  process  safety  and  employee  safety  issues.   These\r\ninitiatives  include a safety committee to promote both  process\r\nand  personal  safety.

Within this program, each process  is\r\nsystematically  examined  to identify hazards  and  ensure  that\r\nadequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe  Brady Gas Plant primarily uses the What If / Checklist (DP-\r\n10)  analysis  technique  to  perform  these  evaluations.  This\r\nanalysis  is  recognized  as  one of  the  most  systematic  and\r\nthorough   hazard  evaluation  techniques.  The   analyses   are\r\nconducted  using  a  team  of  people  who  have  operating  and\r\nmaintenance  experience as well as engineering  expertise.  This\r\nteam identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well  as\r\naccident   prevention   and  mitigation  measures,   and   makes\r\nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures\r\nwhen the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe  PHA  team  findings are forwarded to  local  and  corporate\r\nmanagement for resolution. Implementation of mitigation  options\r\nin  response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking\r\nassigned  by  the  PHA  team.

These periodic  reviews\r\nare  conducted at least every 5 years and will be  conducted  at\r\nthis  frequency  until the process is no longer  operating.

The  program  consists  of  procedures   for\r\nresponding to a release of a regulated substance, including  the\r\npossibility  of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance  is\r\naccidentally"

The procedures address  all  aspects  of\r\nemergency  response,  including  proper  first-aid  and  medical\r\ntreatment  for  exposures, evacuation plans and  accounting  for\r\npersonnel  after an evacuation, notification of local  emergency\r\nresponse  agencies and the public if a release occurs, and  post\r\nincident cleanup and decontamination procedures. In addition the\r\nBrady   Gas  Plant  has  procedures  that  address  maintenance,\r\ninspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as  well\r\nas  instructions  that  address the use  of  emergency  response\r\nequipment.  Employees receive training in  these  procedures  as\r\nnecessary  to perform their specific emergency response  duties.\r\nThe  emergency  response program is updated  as  necessary.  Any\r\nsignificant  changes  to  the  emergency  response  program  are\r\nadministered  through  the management of change  (MOC)  process,\r\nwhich  includes informing and/or training affected personnel  in\r\nthe changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Brady Gas Plant\r\nis coordinated with the Sweetwater county, local emergency\r\nplanning committee (LEPC). This coordination\r\nincludes  periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes  local\r\nemergency  response officials, local government  officials,  and\r\nindustry  representatives.  The gas plant  has  around-the-clock\r\ncommunications  capability with appropriate LEPC  officials  and\r\nemergency  response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This\r\nprovides  a  means of notifying the public of  an  incident,  if\r\nnecessary,  as  well  as  facilitating  quick  response  to   an\r\nincident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the gas  plant\r\nconducts  periodic emergency drills that involve  the  LEPC  and\r\nemergency  response organizations. The Brady Gas Plant  provides\r\ntraining  and  equipment to local emergency responders  so  that\r\nthey  are  familiar  with  any  unique  hazards  that  they  may\r\nencounter  when  responding to emergencies"

Some  of  these\r\nfindings  result in modifications to the process. The  following\r\ntypes  of  changes were implemented in response to PHA  findings\r\nand the Compliance Audits:\r\n\r\n  1. Revision to personnel training programs.\r\n  \r\n  2. Revision to operating procedures.\r\n  \r\n  3. Revision to inspection procedures.\r\n  \r\n  4.
