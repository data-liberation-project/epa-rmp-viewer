Contingency plans and safety procedures are in place at the facility to protect on-site employees. In addition to Systech employees, the procedures are in place to protect contractors, the environment, and outside communities. The Fredonia site is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe Systech Environmental Corporation is located in Wilson County, Kansas. The facility receives and processes flammable industrial waste into an alternative fuel that is used in cement kilns. Systech pioneered the process by which the energy value of wastes are recovered, thus not only providing an inexpensive source of energy, but also consuming waste that would otherwise present a disposal problem. Systech is located on an 11-acre tract of land in a rural setting about 2 miles south of the center of the City of Fredonia. Systech began operation in Fredonia in 1982. Today there are 42 employees. Systech also supports the community by purchasing about $2,600,000 annually in supplies, services, and utilities. The Risk Management Plan is being submitted as a 5 year update per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(1).\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled & Covered Process:\n\nSystech has identified three RMP-listed flammables - ethyl ether, isopentane, and pentane. Generally, these chemicals would be received as components of waste mixtures which would greatly reduce any hazards they may present in the pure form. Many of the activities and programs recently required by the RMP Rule have been in place at the Systech facility since the beginning of the fuels program. Safety has long been part of Systech's program. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release pre"

This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur. Systech has invested and continues to invest substantial effort and capital in maintaining their strong safety and environmental performance.\n\n\n\nSafety is a day-to-day focus at the facility. Systech's program includes elements such as:\n\n(1) Process Hazard Analysis - Systech performs and maintains up to date, systematic and thorough studies of our operations to identify what could go wrong, identifies means of eliminating or reducing design or procedural weaknesses, and implements improvements. \n\n\n\n(2) Process Design - Systech's processes and equipment are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices. Designs include, as appropriate, emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, and ventilation systems. Systech's storage vessels, which contain the greatest inventories of chemicals, are contained in concrete catch basins (dikes) that would confine any waste spills. \n\n\n\n(3) Training - Systech's operations and maintenance personnel are trained thoroughly on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment. They also receive refresher training. Systech's procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices, and emergency response, are fully documented and maintained up to date in light of any changes at the site. \n\n\n\n(4) Mechanical Integrity - Each item of equipment at the site that is involved in maintaining safety or in respon"

No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of their processes. Systech's Risk Management Program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals they handle. For example, Systech's operating, maintenance, safe work, and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the chemicals being handled. Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures, including release detection devices.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how the Systech facility complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\n\n\nThe Systech Fredonia facility has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an incident, the Systech facility has systems to respond quickly. Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis. Spills or leaks can be noted immediately and reported to emergency coordinators. Systech has in place a written emergency contingency plan that they coordinate with the Wilson County Sheriff's Department, the Fredonia Fire Department, and the Fredonia Regional Hospital Ambulance Service. New personnel are trained on the plan initially and on any significant revisions to the plan. In addition, refresher training is provided on an annual basis.
