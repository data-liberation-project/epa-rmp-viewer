      "SummaryText": "This facility receives Carbon Dioxide as a byproduct of natural gas production from The EnLink Midstream plant located in Bridgeport TX.. The Carbon Dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into liquid form and the liquid Carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid. The facility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid Carbon Dioxide (dry ice). \nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in an Closed Loop Ammonia refrigeration system located on the facility. An ammonia receiver stores the Ammonia refrigerant in addition to various heat exchangers, compressors, condensers and connecting piping and valves.\n\nOur worst case scenario for ammonia system is a failure of the ammonia receiver resulting in the release of ammonia. The quantity of the release is estimated to be 25,000lb of ammonia over a 10 minute period of time with most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a release and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to\natmospheric conditions. The calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 1.5 miles. These calculations were based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"\nPublic receptors identified within 1.5 miles of the facility include commercial/industrial areas as well as residential areas. The estimated population that may be affected is 207 based of the 2020 consensus data.\nAn alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA guidelines. A leak from a pipe, pump or vessel was assumed to create a release at the rate of 200lb per minute. The atmospheric condition are assumed to be more typical of the area and the toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 0.1 miles. Public receptors within 0.1 miles of the facility include commercial/industrial facilities.\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention program and all app"

In addition, this facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program. Our comprehensive prevention program includes documented process safety information to ensure\nsafe and reliable plant operation, process hazard analysis to identify and train all effected employees in the hazards associated with the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, mechanical integrity procedures to ensure adequate and proper plant maintenance. \nShould an accident or near miss occur, procedures are in place to thoroughly investigate the\nincident and take corrective action as necessary. We believe the key to preventing incidents is continuously improving our operating and prevention procedures and better educating our employees.\nThis is a new facility with all refrigeration components being made within ASME and ASHRAE\nspecifications. The system is also to be thoroughly inspected and tested prior to starting the system.\nIn the event of an Ammonia release, the plant has developed an emergency response plan and procedure. If necessary, the Bridgeport Fire Department will be contacted and emergency response procedures will be coordinated with the Bridgeport Fire Department and Wise county LEPC and any other local authorities in order to most effectively protect our employees, our\nproperty and our community."
