Filemon Olvera, Director of Utilities for City of San Juan, is the responsible official at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe City of San Juan Water Treatment Plant No. 2 North is located at the northeast corner of the intersection of I Road and Sioux Road, San Juan, Hidalgo County, Texas (north 26.186483 latitude and west -098.154465 longitude).  The physical address is 2111 N. I  Road.  The City of San Juan Water Treatment Plant No. 2 utilizes chlorine for disinfection. The maximum inventory for Chlorine is 4,000 and threshold quantity 2,500 lbs.  \r\n\r\nTwo one-ton containers of chlorine are stored in the facility. Only one is connected to the system at any given time.  The facility is staffed 24-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) is stored outside chemical building located approximately 15 feet north of the chlorination room.\r\n\r\nRMP regulations for Program 2 processes require one worst-case release scenario, estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoi"

      "SummaryText": "nt. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the Chlorine to the air.  The 2,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by one vessel. The RMP*Comp results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.3 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 19,300 persons. \r\n\r\nOne alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis. The scenario selected involves the failure of the transfer hose on regulator connection. This failure results in the release of the entire contents of the containers over a period of 20 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 91.6 pounds of chlorine per minute. The RMP*Comp  dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.2 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L). The total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is estimated at 16,500. \r\n\r\nPopulation estimates are based on 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data from MARPLOT.   \r\n\r\nA search of MARPLOT did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint. Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe City of San Juan Utility Department has implemented a General Accidental Release Prevention Program to minimize releases.  The program includes:  safety information on the covered chemicals, hazard reviews, operating and maintenance procedures, training, incident investigations, and emergency response procedures.\r\n\r\nThe City of San Juan ensures that each employee presently operating th"

Each employee must have successfully reviewed operating procedures and demonstrated his/her ability to perform their duties. In addition, annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the chlorination process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.  A written test is administered to ensure operators are aware of the process and safety.\r\n\r\nThe San Juan Water Treatment Plant No. 2 emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. The emergency response procedures consider dangers within the plant that may affect employees as well as dangers outside of the plant that may affect the public or the environment. \r\n\r\nThe San Juan Water Treatment Plant personnel are not first responders, although they are trained in response techniques and will notify other first responders in the event of an accidental chlorine release. An emergency response plan is kept on-site where all employees have access to it.  The City of San Juan Fire Department is the first responder.  The City of San Juan's Fire Department may request assistance from other neighboring cities equipped with additional HAZMAT capabilities.    \r\n\r\nThe City of San Juan Water Treatment Plant posts escape plans within the facility where any person entering can see them. Facility personnel receive training in the escape plans to leave the building and to leave the area once outside the building.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program        \r\n\r\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility. \r\n      \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe City of San Juan has initiated a training program through the City's Fire Department to familiarize first responders with the Water Treatment facilities.
