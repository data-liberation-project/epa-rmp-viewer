RMC owns and operates a primary aluminum reduction plant and casting facility located on approximately 1,500 acres near Massena, New York.  The site is located on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River, approximately seven miles east of the city of Massena and one mile west of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Reservation.  Approximately 665 people are employed at the facility.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\"The policy of the Reynolds Metals Company is to provide a safe, environmentally responsible, and productive work place for all of its employees.  Safe operation of those processes using highly hazardous chemicals which will protect people, property, and the environment from unwanted, catastrophic chemical releases is of prime importance to the Company.\"  RMC has Process Safety Management (PSM) Manuals for each regulated process that are written to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.119, and the Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA's) Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nRMC has a written chlorine emergency response plan.  Only qualified personnel are allowed to assess and contain a leak from a covered process.  RMC maintains trained Incident Commanders for coordination of the emergency response and notification to the proper outside agencies. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source's Regulated Substances and Processes\n \nRMC uses and stores only one covered chemical, chlorine, in excess of the applicability threshold.  Chlorine has a defined threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  There are three separate processes that contain chlorine in quantities greater than the applicability threshold.  These processes are identified"

      "SummaryText": "as follows:\n\n7 raw water treatment;\n7 chlorine storage; and\n7 chlorine process building (Casthouse fluxing and degassing).\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\n A worst-case scenario for toxic substances like chlorine is defined by the EPA as the release of the largest quantity of the toxic substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  For this facility, the worst-case scenario is a release of chlorine from a one-ton container (2,000 pounds).  RMC utilized the EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) Document to determine the distance to the toxic end-point for the worst-case scenario. \n The objective of the accidental release evaluation is to determine the downwind distance to a defined toxic endpoint.  In the case of toxic substances, the endpoint is the concentration in air that is believed to be protective of the public for one-hour exposure periods.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine as defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guide 2 (ERPG-2) is 0.0087 mg/l (approximately 3 ppm).  The distance to the toxic endpoint based on the OCAG document and the corresponding worst case scenario is 3 miles from the release point. \n\nAlternative Scenario\n\n RMC performed advanced dispersion modeling using the SLAB program.  Unlike the worst-case scenario there are no EPA-defined meteorological conditions that must be used in estimating the dispersion of the chlorine plume, other than using typical meteorological data for the facility.  The alternative scenario was developed based on the facility's five-year accident history and the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), which was revalidated in 1999.  The alternative scenario has been defined as a packing nut failure from a single ton container resulting in a vapor release within the raw water building.  The raw water building provides passive mitigation.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine as predicted by the SLAB model is 0.13 miles.\n\nAccidental Rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease Prevention\n\nThe OSHA PSM rule requires that management systems be developed and implemented to help prevent or reduce the consequences of a release.  The program elements have been in place and provide improved protection against chlorine incidents.  All equipment that is in direct contact with the chlorine systems is designed and intended for use in a chlorine environment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n The accident history related to storage and use of chlorine (the covered processes) at the facility is required as a component of the facility's RMP. There have been two accidents involving the covered processes requiring medical attention at the facility within the past five-years (21 June 1994 through 21 June 1999, the 5-year period prior to the initial submission of the RMP to EPA).  These accidents were minor in nature and both resulted from equipment malfunction.  The first incident occurred on June 19, 1995 and the second incident occurred on July 12, 1995.  As a result RMC revised operating procedures, improved or upgraded the equipment, implemented inventory control procedures, revised the emergency response plan and improved employee training.  Due to these improvements there have been no reportable incidents involving chlorine in almost four years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRMC has a written Emergency Chlorine Response Procedure and a 24-hour Chlorine Emergency Response Team that are immediately activated in the event of a release.  The Chlorine Emergency Response Team is trained to handle incidents involving chlorine, including repairing damaged or leaking containers and fighting fires involving chlorine.  As an additional precaution, the Facility maintains a chlorine emergency response trailer, which is stocked with the necessary equipment to manage and control an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nCurrently there are several items scheduled for implementation to further improve safety and lessen the likelihood"
