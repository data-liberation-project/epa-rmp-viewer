All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The HWWS emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirments.\n     The Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 has been installed to disinfect and treat the flow of domestic and industrial wastewater prior to discharge into the Arroyo Colorado River.  The facility utilizes a chlorinating and sulfur dioxide station in the treatment process.  The stations include liquid chlorine containers, anhydrous sulfur dioxide containers, a chlorinator, various tye of safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains a flow recorder and various electrical panels.  The amount of chlorine handled is three(3) one-ton cylinders with one on-line and two one standby.  The anount of sulfur dioxide handled is three(3) one-ton cylinders with one on-line and two on standby.  Plant operators are at the facility 24 hours a day and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n     The general HWWS accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n      *     High level of training of the operators\n      *     Preventive maintenance programs\n      *     Use of state of the art process and safety equipment\n      *     Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the particpation of the operators\n      *     Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n      *     Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n    Chemical specific prevention steps include availability of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn during connection and disconnecti"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and dril eveluations are conducted every six months; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n     Changes to improve safety (recommended actions) will be reviewed upon completion of a facility Hazardous Assessment and Compliance Audit."
