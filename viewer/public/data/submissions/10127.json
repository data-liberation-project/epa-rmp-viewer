The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total                contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint  point of detontation  is .40 miles. \n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of detontation ) is .10 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of NFPA 58 for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage .and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.for general safety.\n\n\n\n \n5.
