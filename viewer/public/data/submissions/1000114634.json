The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a 30-second release from a failure of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact, pull-away, material defect, or overpressurization during a transfer operation.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Chief Regulatory Officer implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Chief Regulatory Officer is assisted by other trained personnel as directed. The Chief Regulatory Officer is responsible for ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the implementation of the Program 3 Accident Prevention Program elements as related to their responsibilities.  The accident prevention program elements addressed in the PSM/RMP combined program includes: Management System, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor, Pre-Startup Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Response, Compliance Audits, and Trade Secrets.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn general, the following changes to improve safety of the covered processes at this Facility include:\n\n\u0095\tInstall appropr"

The OSHA PSM and EPA Subpart D RMP standards are applicable to operations at this Facility.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident. The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update.  All relevant sections of the Facility RMPr have been reviewed and/or updated.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of chemical storage and handling, blending, retail sale and distribution.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a third party owned and operated commercial cargo truck.  The cargo truck Operator transfers anhydrous ammonia from the commercial cargo truck to one stationary pressure vessel (PV) with a capacity equal to 29,998-gallons. \n\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia in the stationary PV and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the PV to the Facility-owned Mobile Pipe Reactor to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer by blending anhydrous ammonia with super-phosphoric acid in a reacting chamber and then mixing the hot melt with water.  Trained Process Operators perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia and operate the Mobile Pipe Reactor in accordance with its PSM/RMPr accident prevention program.    \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.
