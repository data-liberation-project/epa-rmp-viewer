The on-site quantity of HCl in the Bulk HCl System exceeds EPA's RMP PSM threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds (listed in Appendix 1 of 40 CFR 68.130). The Bulk HCl System consists of a 21,000-pound tube trailer provided by the chemical manufacturer and two 400-liter Y-cylinders (\"tonners\") as well as associated gas cabinets, valve manifold boxes, piping, valves, and controls.  The tube trailer and tonners are stored in a secured outdoor area to the northwest of the northwest corner of the TI Facility. \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\nTexas Instruments has implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program.\nAt TI, we strive to maintain a culture and work environment free of illness or injury. Each employee is accountable for making that possible, regardless of their role.\nIn our drive toward zero work-related injuries and illnesses and safe operations, we aim to:\n\u0095\tComply with applicable environmental, safety and health (ESH) laws and regulations.\n\u0095\tCreate and operate safe work sites.\n\u0095\tMaintain proper safety protocols and controls.\n\u0095\tDesign and build inherently safe buildings, and engineer out equipment risks.\n\u0095\tDeliver relevant and required ESH training.\n\u0095\tInspect and audit our processes to assess compliance with the many rigorous legal and customer requirements as well as our own stringent standards.\nThe TI Facility complies with the rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride, including EPA 40 CFR 68, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, and applicable industry codes and standards. \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nTI designed the"

Examples of system design for chemical-specific accidental release prevention include storage in appropriately designed pressure vessels and distribution within piping designed and tested for compatibility with the properties (pressures, temperatures, corrosivity) of the chemistry. Examples of mitigation systems selected specifically for anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride include designing all mechanical piping connections to be located within exhausted enclosures, area ambient chlorine gas leak monitoring and detection, and a vapor mitigation (water misting) system designed to be initiated upon chlorine leak detection to suppress a vapor cloud in the event of an accidental release.\nTI management and employees of the TI Facility are committed to preventing any accidental releases of anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride through the design, selection, and use of proper equipment as well regular inspections, maintenance, repairs, and audits of the equipment and processes. TI employees and contractors having duties related to the Bulk HCl System are thoroughly trained on applicable tasks and procedures.  \nThe five-year accident history\nAs of the date of this RMP resubmission, there have been no accidents or incidents involving the Bulk HCl System. Incidents involving substances managed pursuant to RMP requirements will be promptly investigated, with the investigation starting in less than 48 hours. All incident records will be kept at least five years. If an incident occurs that meets the reporting criteria of RMP regulations, an RMP update will be submitted within six months and include a five-year incident history. \nThe emergency response program\nTI Facility worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to plan for a response to an accidental release in order to minimize the impact to people and the environment.

The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous and regulated substances. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including: \n\u0095\tProper first aid and medical treatment for exposures,\n\u0095\tEvacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation,\n\u0095\tNotification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs,\n\u0095\tPost-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, \n\u0095\tInspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment, and;\n\u0095\tTraining for all employees in relevant procedures. \nThe TI Facility coordinates emergency response efforts with local emergency responders (fire departments, LEPC, etc.) and provides training to facilitate an understanding of the regulated chemicals and process. \nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes, and employees are informed of changes.\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all Texas Instruments locations, including the Facility. Periodic inspections, audits, and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. On-going programs, such as audits and process hazard analysis revalidations, continually aim to improve process safety. The TI Facility maintains an ESH management system that is certified to both International Standardization Organization (ISO) 14001 and 45001. This ensures implementation of a successful safety and environmental management program that includes most of the elements required under the RMP rules implemented throughout the entire plant."
