If a release should occur, ARKEMA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.  The mitigation measures identified for the Worst-case scenario would also apply to the Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  This prevention program covers those processes that use chlorine and methyl chloride above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\u00bf In-depth process hazard analyses are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under OSHA PSM standards;\n\u00bf Written operating procedures (updated annually) are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\u00bf Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;  \n\u00bf A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly; \n\u00bf A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are reviewed and implemented safely;\n\u00bf Critical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating cond"

The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.  \n\nMeasures that would prevent the worst-case scenario primarily consist of chemical handling policies and standard operating procedures to ensure care in moving rail cars near and within the facility.  Delivery and on-site rail car handling personnel are highly trained and skilled, and rail cars are moved at very low speeds.  The integrity of the permanent onsite vessels is maintained through the mechanical integrity program via the aforementioned vessel inspections and tests.  The rail cars are protected from over pressurization with a pressure relief system.\n\nPotential hazards that could produce a catastrophic release are strictly controlled.  Rail cars are spotted and moved only in areas with no overhead construction or equipment that could fall and impact a car.  Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk of sabotage.  Construction throughout the facility is non-combustible, and fire hazards are strictly controlled.  The risk of fire induced vessel failure is extremely low.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine was selected as a valve packing failure.

The valves are designed to limit the rate of release to no more than 15,000 pounds per hour.  There are remotely operated valves which can be closed from the control room or remote security station should a problem occur.  This would serve to limit the release size and therefore, reduce the potential for off-site impact in the unlikely event of a release.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride is the release from a pipe leak.    Piping release scenarios could result from failures of flanges, fittings, or from a hole in the transfer piping.  Primarily, all transfer lines utilize welded connections, and the use of fittings and flanges is minimized.  Prevention steps for this scenario include strict adherence to piping and pipe support design standards, proper maintenance, inspections and tests under the mechanical integrity program.  Maintenance work practices are controlled to prevent mechanical impact or other piping stresses.\n\nFrom the beginning of 1999 to the present, there have been no accidents/releases of regulated substances from covered processes that meet the criteria for the Five Year Accident History, which are focused on serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. ATOFINA realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year accident History.

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATE\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at ARKEMA\u00bfs Carrollton production facility for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n\u00bf Introduction;\n\u00bf ARKEMA policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00bf Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00bf Hazard Assessment;\n\u00bf Prevention Program;\n\u00bf Five year accident history;\n\u00bf Emergency Response Plan;\n\u00bf Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at ARKEMA for many years; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  ARKEMA is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the CEO.  Senior management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where plant personnel regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of ARKEMA\u00bfs HES programs is reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors.  \n\nARKEMA\u00bfs HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill ARKEMA\u00bfs commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and or reduce the risk of accidents.  \n\nThe ARKEMA Carrollton facility is located at 2316 Highland Ave., Carrollton, Kentucky.

Chlorine and methyl chloride are present in covered processes at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n \nChlorine and methyl chloride are used as process feedstocks. Phosphorous Trichloride (PCL3) was reported in the original RMP submittal in 1999. Since that time, the plant has discontinued the product made with PCL3 and no longer stores or processes this chemical. \n\nThe worst-case accidental release scenario is a catastrophic failure of a liquid chlorine rail car.  It should be noted that both regulatory agencies and ARKEMA believe that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event.  This Risk Management Plan includes information on mitigation and prevention measures implemented by ATOFINA to reduce the risk of this type of event.  \n\nThe multiple layers of preventative measures make it unlikely that a significant chlorine release will occur.  Chlorine rail cars are built with extreme integrity and safety precautions.  The rail cars are rigorously designed and tested according to the procedures and schedules recommended by the Chlorine Institute.\n\nIn addition, in the unlikely event that a release occurs, ARKEMA has an array of mitigation measures to reduce any potential impacts.   These include:\n\n\u00bf Site emergency action plan;\n\u00bf Chlorine detectors;\n\u00bf Alarm system initiated by chlorine detectors;\n\u00bf Plant emergency alarm system;\n\u00bf Operators trained to make an initial response;\n\u00bf On-site emergency response team for each shift trained at the Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) technician level;\n\u00bf Medical department on-site; \n\u00bf Notification to LEPC to activate Community Response Plan.\n\u00bf Automatic shutoff valves that may be actuated from either the process control room or remote secuity station.\n\u00bf Automatic shutoff valves that are interlocked to shut upon movement of the railcar.\n\nOne alternative scenario for each regulated toxic substance was also devel"
