Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis City of Paso Robles Wastewater Treatment Facility, located at 3200 Sulphur Springs Road, Paso Robles, Ca., handles chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Paso Robles Wasteswater Treatment Plant uses chlorine  to disinfect the treated wastewater to prevent the spread of pathogenic organisms.  The chlorine is used in the final treatment step to disinfect the effluent from the secondary sedimentation basins prior to it's storage in storage ponds for eventual discharge to the Salinas River.  The chlorination system is composed of two 2,000 pounds per day chlorinators with several application points.   The overall system provides for : 1) continuous chlorination of the wastewater ahead of the Chlorine Contact Basin; 2) addition of chlorine to the wastewater at the trickling filter wetwell; and 3) addition of chlorine at the secondary sedimentation basin splitter box.  \n \nChlorine is delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WWTP.  Off-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a hoist. All the one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine storage area. The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to"

      "SummaryText": "per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual. This treatment facility operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.\n\nThe chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm and withdraws the gas from the one-ton containers at a controlled feed rate set by the operators with the use of the rotometer at the chlorinator unit. The chlorine gas is injected into the feed water line, where it becomes a chlorine/ water solution and is feed where it is needed in the treatment process. The container storage building has two chlorine leak detectors; one in the chlorine storage room and one in the chlorinator room.  Each detector is wired to a red alarm light and sound alarms in the Chlorine Building and the City Police Station.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substances are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one-ton (2,000 pounds) chlorine container is the largest vessel size (and only chlorine vessel size) in the chlorine system located at the Wastewater Treatment Facility.   The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one-ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for chlorine for the one-ton container located at the Wastewater Treatment Facility assumes a release from a valve packing, resulting in an estimated release of no more than 2 pounds per hour.  The period of release is taken to be one hour in duration, resulting in a total release quantity of 2 pounds for each regulated substance. The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Alter"

Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine systems and the training provided to the operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of chlorine released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant's Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Paso Robles Fire and Police Departments at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The San Luis Obispo County Division of Environmental Health Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Local"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine system.  These commitments will be the revention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances."
