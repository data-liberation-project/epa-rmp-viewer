It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Bondurant Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Polk County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Bondurant, Iowa location is John Bergeson, agronomy  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of ten (10)  30,000-gallon rail cars and one (1) 12,000-gallon  storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year as many as fifty (50) 1,000-gallon and thirty (30) 1,500-gallon portable nurse tanks may also be present at the site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure  one (1) of the 30,000-gallon rail car storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses. The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpo"

The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Bondurant, the City of ALttona, the northwest corner of the Town of Mitchellville, and the unincorporated communities of Nobleton and Santiago, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Farmers Elevator Company has extended to the Bondurant Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nThe firm has an active and on-going safety and regulatory compliance program. Employees are annually trained on the safe handling and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. Recently changes have been made in the preventive maintenance program which include but are not limited to a documented accounting of repairs and maintenance activities. The operations manager is responsible for ensuring that appropriate repairs and maintenance"

      "SummaryText": "activities take place on a regular, scheduled basis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nFarmers Elevator Company, Bondurant, Iowa has experienced one (1) accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia. The release occurred on August 26, 1997. The quantity released approximated 1985 pounds. The release occurred when the main discharge valve on one of the rail car storage tanks did not seal properly following transfer of product from that vessel to the 12,000-gallon storage tank from which anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks are filled and dispatched. No deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place were required. The Bondurant Volunteer Fire Department, company officials, and the Polk County Emergency Management Agency responded to the scene. With the assistance of the Bondurant Fire Department, an employee of Farmers Elevator Company donned appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the release site, and successfully closed the errant valve. Subsequent to the release, company personnel replaced the seal on the discharge valve.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Farmers Elevator Company  to immediately notify the Bondurant Volunteer Fire Department and the Polk County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Bondurant Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Bondurant location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Bondurant has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Polk County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are assoc"

      "SummaryText": "iated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
