      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nZep Manufacturing Company (Zep) stores and uses propane and isobutane as a propellant for aerosol packaging. Propane and isobutane are flammable gases under ambient conditions. The release of propane or isobutane to the atmosphere results in a vapor cloud that could easily ignite and explode.  It is Zep's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees as well as members of the surrounding community.  \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe facility is a chemical blending facility.  Materials are blended to produce cleaning products that are packaged for shipment.  Propane and isobutane are used as propellants for the packaging of aerosol products. \n\nThe regulated substances stored and used at the facility are propane and isobutane.  The maximum amount of propane that is stored at the facility is 92,000 pounds and the maximum amount of isobutane that is stored is 49,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of a storage tank when filled to the greatest allowable amount of propane would result in the release of 45,000 pounds of propane.  Zep complies with NFPA code and limits tank filling to 88% capacity.  The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire contents are released, a vapor cloud forms, and the vapor reaches an ignition source resulting in an explosion. EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) was used to determine the distance to the flammable endpoint. The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi is 0.29 miles.  The estimated population within the impacted area is 1 person. No environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area.\n\nAlternative Scenario - Failure of a 25 foot length of 4 inch transfer hose during tank filling.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are re"

      "SummaryText": "leased.  The resulting vapor cloud travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the alternative scenario is 316 feet. This release scenario has the possibility of extending beyond the site boundary.  No people reside and no environmental receptors were identified within the impacted area.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe process complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  The process was designed and constructed according to NFPA-58.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe process has never had an accidental release of propane or isobutane.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n\nZep has a comprehensive emergency response program that has been reviewed and coordinated with the local fire department.  A representative from the fire department visited the plant on December 17, 1998. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nZep will continue to comply with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule."
