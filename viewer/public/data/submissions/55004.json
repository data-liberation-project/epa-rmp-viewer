Many of these prevention programs; i.e., PHAs, compliance audits, and incident investigations result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). All covered processes have control system designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits. The facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operablity) to ensure the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or control accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals. \n\nIn addition, the facility has a comprehensive Security Plan designed to minimize the potential impact on JCI personnel, facilities, equipment, processes and products as a result of unlawful acts either made or attempted by individuals seeking to harm personnel, property and or the environment.",

Any residual compressed gas is absorbed in an appropriate solution and sold as product. The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nThe prevention programs described in this facility?s Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g. PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). All covered processes have control system designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits. The facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure that the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility?s Safety, Engineering, and Safety Training Manuals. \n\n4.    The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility complied a five-year accident history (June 1, 2004 ? May 31, 2009) for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage as required by the RMP regulations. The five-year accident history allows the facility to explain to the co"

And the procedural and technological changes made to minimize the likelihood that these accidental releases will ever occur again. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence. \n\nPersonnel at the facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from June 1, 2004 to May 31, 2009 to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. No accidental releases were identified. \n\n5.    The Emergency Response Plan\n\nOverall safety at this facility is governed not only by the ability to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases. This facility therefore developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment. The facility has trained emergency response team (ERT), appropriate equipment and supplies, and a detailed Contingency Plan. The Contingency Plan outlines the procedures to be taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substance and specifies notification, evacuation, and release control and containment measures for accidental releases that may occur at the facility or on the highway (in transportation accidents). \n\nThe Contingency Plan Manual includes specific process information, a list of emergency equipment, emergency evacuation plans, and a list of plant personnel. The manual also includes a list of telephone numbers of agencies and individuals to contact in the event that one of several pre-identified emergencies"

The agencies and individuals represent local emergency responders (e.g. fire department), public notification and regulatory reporting requirements (e.g., EPA) and internal notification (e.g., Branch Manager, Corporate Headquarters). Written coordination agreements that documents arrangements with local emergency responders are maintained in the Contingency Plan Manual. \n\nThe Contingency Plan includes plans to respond to releases of regulated substances, and identifies the ERT training requirements, qualifications, and responsibilities within the incident command system. The ERT comprises individuals from operations, maintenance, and engineering. In addition to the ERT, this facility has identified, properly trained, and properly equipped employees to administer first aid until the outside responders arrive. All ERT members complete on-site annual eight-hour refresher training. \n\nThe Contingency Plan includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of regulated and other extremely hazardous substances. The procedures identify the individuals by training level that perform the actions, administrative and engineering controls (e.g., ventilation), the required PPE, first aid requirements, and required equipment. \n\nThis facility maintains emergency response equipment and PPE for use by the ERT and the fire department. The emergency response equipment is included in the mechanical integrity program, assuring that required testing and inspection frequencies are adhered to and preventive maintenance activities are conducted. Examples of PPE maintained at this facility include air-purifying respirators and self-contained breathing apparatuses. \n\nThe Contingency Plan is reviewed monthly at the facility?s month safety meetings to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Employees are trained in the emergency response program when initially hired, when the emergency response plan is revised, and whe"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety    \nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.\n\nJCI facility personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2] developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association for toxic gases): \n\n?
