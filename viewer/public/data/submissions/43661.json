In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage. Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n2.  King\u00bfs Delight #6 utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for its production of poultry products.  Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, freezing products, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its superior heat transfer capacities and non-ozone depleting qualities.\n\n3. Accident Prevention Program\nThe facility at 1150 Aviation Blvd. in Gainesville, Georgia was constructed in 2004.  It was co"

      "SummaryText": "nstructed by reputable contractors who had to comply with the plant\u00bfs safety program.  All construction on the ammonia system was completed in full compliance with all applicable local building codes.  Work performed was in compliance with ASHRAE Standard 15, \u00bfSafety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\u00bf and ASME B31.5 \u00bfRefrigeration Piping.\u00bf  The plant has hired an experienced refrigeration manager to handle the operation and maintenance of the new facility\u00bfs system.  This individual has completed necessary HAZMAT training and experienced with working on ammonia systems.\n      \nThe facility is installed with numerous devices to aid technicians in the safe operation of the plant.  Ammonia detectors are located throughout the plant to indicate any leaks that may occur.  The system is equipped with a computer control system that can be accessed both from the facility and via a computer equipped with a modem.\n\n4.  Accident History: The facility has never had an ammonia related accident.\n\n5  Emergency ResponseTechnicians responsible for the safe operation have received HAZMAT training.  The Process Safety and Risk Management program requires that the individuals responsible for the emergency operations receive annual training. Hall County is equipped with a HAZMAT team to assist the plant.  The plant will continue to update and review the emergency response program with all additional employees.\n\n8.  Changes to improve safety\nKing\u00bfs Delight #6 is very grateful of their employees and stresses their safety.  For this reason new employees go through orientation prior to employment.  The plant has a full time safety director devoted to employee safety and human factor analyses."
