      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ? OCEAN SPRAY CRANBERRIES, INC.\n\nOcean Spray Cranberries, Incorporated (Ocean Spray) in Kenosha, Wisconsin processes cranberries into juice and sauce products.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of all the products within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  Each refrigeration system consists of a high-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves.  There are two ammonia systems within the facility.  One system (Main System) was estimated to hold approximately 11,000 pounds of ammonia, while the other system (Aseptic System) was estimated to hold approximately 9,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.  \n                                                                                                                                         \nThe calculated inventory of the Main system indicates it could be charged with over 10,000-pounds of ammonia. Previous estimates indicated that the Main system was charged with a maximum of 8940 pounds. The calculated inventory of the Aseptic system indicates under 10,"

      "SummaryText": "000-pounds of an ammonia charge.  The RMP and PSM rules require facilities to address only those processes that contain over the 10,000 pound threshold of ammonia unless a release of one process could result in a release from the other, or an external event to the processes (such as a fire or explosion) could have the potential to release ammonia from multiple containers.\n\nUnder most circumstances, a release from the Main system would not cause a release of the Aseptic system unless an external fire spreads from one vessel to the other.  Although there is a low likelihood that there would be a catastrophic fire that would engulf both processes, Ocean Spray has elected to include both systems in the RMP and PSM programs to ensure the safety of employees and surrounding areas. \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? (November 1998), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration?s (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998), and the RMP*CompTM were the primary vehicles used to develop the worst case scenario.  The worst-case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst-case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention.  It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the largest high-pressure receiver is released. To be conservative, the release scenario was performed assuming that the receiver was filled to 100 percent capacity.  Ocean Spray has set an internal policy of never charging each of the high-pressure receivers greater than 30% while the systems are operati"

      "SummaryText": "ng.  This policy has been developed to prevent the tanks from overfilling and over pressurization due to expansion. Ocean Spray also has a policy that the high-pressure receivers on either system will never be filled greater than 87% when it is idle (prior to system restart).  The toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the results of the RMP*CompTM, a release from the receiver would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario:  The alternative case release scenario selected is one in which a relief valve lifts to relieve pressure in the system.  EPA?s ?Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? (November 1998), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration?s (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998), and the RMP*CompTM were the primary vehicles used to develop the alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n1) Must be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and \n2) Must reach an endpoint off-site, unless no such criteria exist.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which a safety relief valve lifts, to relieve pressure, in the system so that the system does not become over pressurized.  The relief valve capacity of the largest high-pressure receiver (Main System) was used for this scenario analysis. The relief valve, which vents to the roof, was assumed to reseat after ten minutes, which is EPA's default for such release scenarios.  Ocean Spray has installed a computerized system that will alert trained plant personnel that a relief valve has lifted to relieve pressure, so that pers"

While the alternative scenario would reach an endpoint off-site (farmland to west), it was estimated that the toxic endpoint would not reach any population.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  As a part of its PSM Program, Ocean Spray has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The programs include:\n\n?Process Safety Information\n?Process Hazard Analysis\n?Operating Procedures\n?Training\n?Mechanical Integrity\n?Management of Change\n?Pre-startup Review\n?Compliance Audits\n?Incident Investigations\n?Employee Participation\n?Hot Work Permits\n?Contractor Safety\n\nIn addition, Ocean Spray has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors.  These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer which signals the location of a release so trained plant personnel can take immediate response actions.\n\nEmergency Response Information:  As a part of the PSM Program, the facility maintains an Emergency Response Plan that was prepared in order to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of action taken during an incident.  As a part of this emergency planning effort, a team of employees has received emergency response training and has been equipped to respond to ammonia releases.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 to notify the Kenosha Police Department, and the Kenosha Fire Department.  The Kenosha County Local Emergency Response Committee has included the Ocean Spray facility in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  In the past five years"
