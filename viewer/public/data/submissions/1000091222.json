The facility has been expanded and is now capable of producing 23,000 barrels per day (BPD) of renewable diesel. The feedstock consists mainly of refined animal fats, recycled cooking oil, and corn oil. The facility includes a Pretreatment Unit, which removes metals and other contaminants from the feedstock. DGD also includes a small wastewater treating unit, rail and truck unloading facility, and tank farm area.\r\n\r\nDGD also includes the Ecofining Unit, which utilizes a UOP licensed technology, that uses Hydrotreating and Isomerization processes to convert the fats/oil feedstock into Green Diesel. This process contains approximately 160,000 pounds of flammables as the maximum intended inventory of vessels and piping and is therefore covered under the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n \r\nThis plan has been updated and resubmitted in accordance with 40 CFR 68.190 to address the following:\r\n1.\tReview and certification of the RMP once every five years\r\n2.\tReview and updates, where necessary, to the chemical quantities in the covered process to reflect current maximum inventories,\r\n3.\tUpdates to all prevention program data and other facility information\r\n4.\tReview and update of the Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information about regulated substances at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.
