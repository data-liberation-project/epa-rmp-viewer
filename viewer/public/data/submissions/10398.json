However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe Lewis Run gas processing plant is located approximately 0.5 miles north of Lewis Run, PA on U.S. highway 219.  The plant processes about 2 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed, thus producing a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are recovered are sold as a mixed propane, butane and natural gasoline product.  Total liquid production is approximately 70 BPD with total storage capacity of 1,400 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, dehydration and utilizes a straight refrigeration process for hydrocarbon recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full capacity of the largest storage tank, 123,000 Lbs.  Although a written procedure is in place to limit the inventory to 90% of capacity, the entire tank capacity was used in this scenario.  EPA's RMP*COMP software was used to determine that the maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint was 0.4 miles.  \n\nThe ARS is a VCE resulting from the release of product from a truck loading line (16,400 Lbs released in 10 min.).  The release is expected to be blocked in by the operator within 10 minutes.  Again the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used and the distance to a 1 psi endpoint is 0.1 miles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Progra"

      "SummaryText": "m:\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nThe Lewis Run plant includes the following safety features:\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2. Process safety relief valves.\n3. Automated plant shutdown system.  The plant will be automatically shutdown should key process parameters vary from specified ranges. \n4. Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process.\n5. Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Lewis Run plant was placed in operation in November of 1997.  The plant has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Lewis Run plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the McKean County LEPC.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
