It is Phelps Dodge Morenci Inc.'s (PDMI's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur with the anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2) system, it is our policy to notify the Morenci Fire Association and other applicable local agencies and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\nPDMI operates an open pit copper mine, ore processing and copper extraction facilities located in Greenlee County, Arizona.  PDMI will use SO2 in the electrowinning process to improve efficiencies in the recovery of copper.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\nPDMI's worst-case scenario evaluated the failure of one 20ton SO2 storage tank when filled.  The tank is enclosed in an 11,250ft3 building with a concrete foundation and curb.  Both the building and containment measures were assumed to be passive mitigation.  According to EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the distance to the toxic endpoint in a rural setting is 0.7 miles.  The terrain surrounding PDMI is probably more like the \"urban\" (obstructed terrain) than the rural setting.  Using the urbanl setting the distance to the endpoint is 0.3 miles.  The worst-case release scenario, using the more conservative rural setting of 0.7 miles would not affect any public receptors beyond PDMI's property boundary.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The SO2 system is designed, and will be installed, and maintained in accordance with MSHA guidelines.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nPDMI has not had any accidents involving SO2 that caused death"

We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department will inspect the sulfur dioxide system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nPDMI is installing an active mitigation system that will route a release of SO2 through a system that will capture the gas and neutralize it prior to being released into the environment.  This active mitigation measure is not required to prevent a release of sulfur dioxide from affecting public receptors; however, it will make the system safer."
