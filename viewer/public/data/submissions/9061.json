This facility complies with NFAP-58 requirements for the storage of LP-Gas storage and it is our policies to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws for both anhydrous ammonia and propane. If a propane emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Ocheyedan Fire Department, Fire Chief, Dan Hartwig (712-758-3603). If a anhyrdous ammonia emergency were to occur it is our policy to contract the Region 3 Emergency Planning District, Marion Roetzel, contact, 24 hour phone 712-754-2556 (Sheriff\"s Office).\n\nThis facility is a farm supply cooperative. The anhydrous ammonia is used by farm producers as plant food for corn production. The propane is used as fuel to dry wet corn to a level to make long term storage possible. \n\nWorst-case release scenario. Our worse case scenario for propane is failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to greatest amount allowed. This resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's tabels the distance to endpoint is .4 miles. Affected population would be 6. The worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of the 30,000 gallon storage tank. This resulting in a toxic cloud with a endpoint of 4.4 miles affecting a population of 722.\n\nAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. CEA complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.The anhydrous ammonia system is inspected by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and maintained to their requirements by CEA personel.\n\nFive year accident history. We have never had an accident involving propane or ammonia that caused death, injury, propery or enviromental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program. In the event of a propane emergency at our facility, it is our policy to notify the Ocheyedan Fire Department"
