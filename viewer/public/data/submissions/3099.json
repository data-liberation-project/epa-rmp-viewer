The products manufactured are sold to other manufactures as raw materials and ingredients in their final products.\n\nIn our processes, Evans Chemetics uses two regulated substances, acrylonitrile [2-propenenitrile] and epichlorohydrin [oxirane, (chloromethyl)-].  Acrylonitrile is used to manufacture a variety of products, including secondary antioxidants for plastics and rubber and polymerization chain transfer agents.  Epichlorohydrin is used to manufacture products used in the photographic, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Release Scenarios, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\n\nTo help understand the potential impact on the community due to a release of chemicals from Evans Chemetics, we have provided information about the worst case scenario and alternate scenarios for our facility.\n\nThese scenarios were developed using the guidance and technical data supplied by the EPA.  Scenario information similar to that described below has been used at Evans Chemetics for over ten years as part of our process safety management program.  In the past we have modeled potential releases and analyzed the results to help us continuously improve our processes and reduce risk.  We continue to do these assessments as part of our continuing effort to reduce any impact we may have on the surrounding community. \n\nThe EPA defines the worst case scenario as a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of a regulated chemical under the worst case meteorological conditions with the complete failure of all active safety systems.  This scenario assumes the entire quantity is released in ten minutes, even if it is impossible to do so.\n\nUsing RMP Comp(tm), a computer program developed by the EPA and NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) to determine the offsite impact of chemical releases, the worst case scenario was determined t"

This worst case scenario could effect the community up to 0.7 miles from the bulk storage tank.\n\nThe worst case scenario described above underscores the need for the rigorous process safety management systems used at Evans Chemetics.  The extensive accidental release prevention program would make the worst case  scenario very unlikely.\n\nSince this worst case scenario is very improbable, they are not good cases to focus on for emergency response planning with the local community.  In order to facilitate emergency response planning with the local community, EPA has included a requirement for companies to report alternate case scenarios.  These alternate case scenarios provide a realistic picture of what could happen if the safety systems used by the facility were to fail.  One alternate scenario for acrylonitrile and one for epichlorohydrin are described below.\n\nThe alternate scenario for acrylonitrile is the complete failure of an unloading chemical hose while unloading acrylonitrile from a tank truck into the bulk storage tank.  In this scenario, up to 1880 pounds of acrylonitrile may be spilled into a tank truck containment area.  A spill of this magnitude may impact the community up to 0.2 miles from the tank truck unloading station.\n\nThe alternate scenario for epichlorohydrin is a complete failure or rupture of an epichlorohydrin transfer line while pumping epichlorohydrin from the epichlorohydrin bulk storage tank to a process reactor.  In this scenario, up to 1480 pounds of epichlorohydrin may be spilled onto a concrete or paved section in the facility.  A spill of this magnitude may impact the community up to 0.1 miles from the location of the spill.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEvans Chemetics has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental releas"
