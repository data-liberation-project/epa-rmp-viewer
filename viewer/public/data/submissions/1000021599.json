The facility has many distinct processes that treat wastewater prior to discharge to the Fox River. One process, the chlorination process, utilizes a chemical regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program Rule: chlorine. The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to wastewater to reduce bacteria. Chlorine is received in ton containers. The chlorine process has a dedicated storage and process area. These process areas have been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes. The chlorination process has a gas detection / warning system, providing an alarm should concentration of chlorine exceed 1 part per million. The chlorine process is maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Wisconsin as Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators. \n\nSPECIAL NOTE: The chlorination process is operated ONLY from May 1 through October 31. During this period, a maximum of two one-ton containers of chlorine are present. During the period November 1 through April 31, the chlorine inventory is minimized, and is below the RMP threshold quantity. Hence, PREDICTIVE FILING has been indicated in this Risk Management Plan. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility maintains a compliance program to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination process.  Compliance with this regulation and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps prevent the release of chlorine. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine in the event that they do occur, and to "

The plan is coordinated with the City of Brookfield, Wisconsin Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  The facility personnel continually review the plant processes for improvements in safety, quality, and performance, and, the facility is periodically inspected by regulatory agencies for compliance with permit and regulatory requirements. Input from these sources is addressed as quickly as possible."
