At this facility, we process raw milk to pasteurized homogenized fluid milk and ice cream.\n\nLike most food processors, we use anhydrous\nammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant \navailable for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, \nammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nDairy Fresh is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation\nfor our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \nobeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate.  Finally, to comply with requirements of the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, we have a Process Safety Management \nprogram to help us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management program includes\nelements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate\npoints in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the\nsafety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so\nthat our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our\nrefrigeration system to identify the\nimportant hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to\nhelp our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the\nrefrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We hve established a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to\nkeep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance\nof the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations t"

The methodology used to evaluate these accidents is\nprescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the\nlikelihood or risk of these incidents. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves loss of the contents of a\nlarge pressure vessel over ten minutes. As required, this\nscenario has offsite impact, meaning that a level of 200 ppm ammonia\nis reached beyond the property line. \n\nThe alternative scenario involves loss of ammonia from a smaller pressure vessel \nunder more favorable meteorological conditions than the worst-case.  This scenario \nis more likely, and not surprisingly, it has less impact offsite."

We are currently\nworking to resolve recommendations and issues raised in our latest Process \nHazards Analysis, and we expect that we will make some changes to the plant and its operations."
