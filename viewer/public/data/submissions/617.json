THE COORDINATOR IS GIVEN TRAINING TO MONITOR THE DAY TO DAY SAFE WORK AACTIVITIES, MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED REGULATORY RECORDKEEPING, CONDUCT MONTHLY SAFETY MEETINGS, AND CONDUCT EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.

ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED BY TRUCK AND 1, IS HANDLED AND STORED ON-SITE. IT IS A REGULATED SUBSTANCE BY EPA REQUIRING US TO COMPLY WITH THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS STORED 1 STATIONARY STORAGE TANK (18,000 GALLON) ON SITE. 79560 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS THE MAXIMUM STORAGE CAPACITY OF STATIONARY STORAGE TANKS. THE LARGEST STORAGE VESSEL AT THIS FACILITY  IS 18,000 GALLON CAPACITY.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO.\n\nOUR WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THE LOSS OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK WHEN FILLED TO THE GREATEST AMOUNT ALLOWED (85% OF CAPACITY), RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES, RESULTING TOTAL VAPOIZATION. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 81549 POUNDS. ACCORDING TO RMP COMP MODELING, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO) IS 3.3 MILES.
