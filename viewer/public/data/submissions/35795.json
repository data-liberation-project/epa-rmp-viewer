      "SummaryText": "The Para-Chem site is located on a 130-acre parcel of land near Simpsonville (Greenville County), South Carolina.  Para-Chem produces acrylic polymers through water-based emulsion polymerization reactions.  This process utilizes a number of chemicals as raw materials, three of which are listed as toxics under 40 CFR 68.130.  Less than 2% of a fourth listed compound, formaldehyde, is a residual reactant in a monomer, N-methylolacrylamide.  Two of these chemicals, acrylonitrile and vinyl acetate monomer, are present in quantities above the threshold limits set forth for the RMP program.  Furthermore, the process in which these chemicals are used is listed under SIC code 2821, making Para-Chem subject to level 3 program requirements.\n\nThe RMP requirements can be divided into two main components: 1) development and implementation of a full risk management program, and 2) documentation and submission of a risk management plan that summarizes key information about the program.  The full risk management program includes a hazard assessment, a management system, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  The risk management plan is designed to present a summary of the risk management program, and the plan will be made available for review by government agencies and the public.  Para-Chem must submit risk management information to EPA by June 21, 2004.\n\nOf the monomers used at Para-Chem, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, ethyl acrylate, formaldehyde (a minor component in N-methylolacrylamide), methyl methacrylate, styrene, and vinyl acetate are classified as hazardous air pollutants.  Of these compounds acrylonitrile, formaldehyde and vinyl acetate are listed among the regulated toxic compounds for RMP [40 CFR 68.130].  Para-Chem also uses aqueous ammonia, which is a regulated toxic compound for RMP [40 CFR 68.130].  \n\nAcrylonitrile is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.

At high doses acrylonitrile can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for acrylonitrile is 20,000 lb.  Para-Chem uses acrylonitrile as a raw material in an emulsion polymerization reaction and stores a quantity greater than the threshold amount in its monomer tank farm. \n\nPara-Chem has not had an accident or incident involving a reportable quantity of this material in the last five years.\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is handled and stored as a non-refrigerated liquid.  Effects of acute exposure to high concentrations of vinyl acetate monomer include irritation of the respiratory tract experienced as nasal discomfort and discharge, with chest pain, coughing, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness.  Liquid or vapor may cause irritation of the eyes experienced as stinging, excess blinking and tear production, with excess redness in the conjunctiva.  At high doses vinyl acetate can be fatal by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact and other routes.  The RMP threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 for vinyl acetate monomer is 15,000 lb.

This allows these facilities to develop an emergency action plan to ensure employee safety, rather than a full-fledged emergency response plan provided that they coordinate with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\nCoordination with local responders also entails the following:\n?  If the facility has a covered process with a regulated toxic substance, it must be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA regarding a response to a potential release.\n?  If the facility has a covered process with a regulated flammable, it must ensure that the local fire department is capable of responding to a potential release and aware of its responsibility to do so.\n\nTo document the requirements, the facility should have a record of: \n?  The emergency contact (i.e., name or organization and number) that would be called for a toxic or flammable release, and\n?  The organization(s) would assist with response procedures.\n\nPara-Chem operates in a manner that attempts to minimize hazards associated with the handling of chemicals.  Para-Chem has several mechanisms in place for addressing a release of a regulated hazardous substance.  These include the following:\n?  A Spill Contingency Plan that documents the emergency contacts\n?  An employee safety manual\n?  ISO 9001 Procedures for unloading railcars and tank trucks\n?  A severe weather plan\n\nThe Spill Contingency Plan that was developed in conjunction with the Process Hazard Analysis for the Polymer Manufacturing Process contains detailed information relating to materials stored on site, potential failures of equipment, and methods for containing or cleaning up lost materials.

The results of these audits are then used to ensure that Para-Chem operates in a safe and compliant manner.\n\nSafety is of utmost concern in any facility that handles hazardous chemicals.

New employees are taught the basics of hazardous materials safety, hazard communication and fire and emergency evacuation procedures as well as specific job related tasks.

Additionally, a copy of the basic safety rules that all employees must abide by is available for review at the site.\n\nPara-Chem sometimes  brings in outside contractors for specific tasks.
