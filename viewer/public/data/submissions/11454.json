The propane system consists of one 30,000 gallon storage vessel from which our supply truck draws off propane for distribution.  It is refilled by the vendor's bulk tanker.  The anhydrous ammonia system consists of one 18,00 gallon storage tank  The ammonia is supplied by the vendor's bulk tanker, and is used to fill nurse tanks.  The nurse tank filling procedure is performen by our own employees.                         .       .         .
