Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety device (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER regulation.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and other resources so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparatin of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture epoxy additives.  One of the product lines manufactured is the diluent product line.  Diluents are sold to others for use as modifiers in two part epoxy systems.  The plant manufactures a number of diluents all of which use Epichlorohydrin as a raw material.  Epichlorohydrin is delivered to the facility by tank truck and stored on site.  It is combined with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst at elevated temperature in the first of three steps required to make diluent products.  \n\nEpichlorohydrin is the regulated substance that is handled at this fa"

The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.4 miles.    Passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nThe \"alternative case scenario\" as defined by the EPA for the release of Epichlorohydrin is the release due to a flange gasket failure on the line from the Epichlorohydrin Storage Tank.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint is <0.1 miles.  Passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving the accidental release of Epichlorohydrin that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or know off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage have occurred at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based on OSHAs HAZWOPER standard.
