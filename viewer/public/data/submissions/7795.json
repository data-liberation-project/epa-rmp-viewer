The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.4 miles.    Passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario as defined by the EPA for the release of Epichlorohydrin is the release due to a flange gasket failure on the line from the Epichlorohydrin Storage Tank.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint is <0.1 miles.  Passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this worst case scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u0012s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents involving the accidental release of Epichlorohydrin that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or know off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage have occurred at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility\u0012s emergency response program is based on OSHA\u0012s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u0012s First Responder Awareness Level.

The substances and processes considered during the preparatin of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture epoxy additives.  One of the product lines manufactured is the diluent product line.  Diluents are sold to others for use as modifiers in two part epoxy systems.  The plant manufactures a number of diluents all of which use Epichlorohydrin as a raw material.  Epichlorohydrin is delivered to the facility by tank truck and stored on site.  It is combined with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst at elevated temperature in the first of three steps required to make diluent products.  \n\nEpichlorohydrin is the regulated substance that is handled at this fa"
