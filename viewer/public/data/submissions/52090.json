This is a new facility with the regulated hazardous chemical first being on site in quantities over the threshold on 6/28/08.  The facility has one refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.  The system is used to maintain temperatures in processing areas, blast freezing, and freezer storage.\n\nThe location has prepared worst case release scenario using the ALOHA air dispersion modeling software.  The alternative case release scenario was prepared using RMPComp air dispersion modeling software. \n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility\u00bfs ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, operator training, procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures for managing system changes, pre-start up safety review procedures, procedures for investigating release incidents, and hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees, and will be periodically audited for compliance required by the RMP regulations.  In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and their employees of the hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administration controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  \n\nSince this is a new facility, in the five years preceding the submittal of"

      "SummaryText": "this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which addresses accidental release of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Region 5 Local Emergency Planning Commission (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf) Inland South.  The facility is included in the LEPC\u00bfs community emergency response plan. The facility currently relies on outside emergency teams for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  Annual training is completed with the Fresno Fire Department and local LEPC.\n\nThe initial process hazard analysis was conducted for the facility in during the first and second week of June 2008.  It identified various recommendations to minimize the risk of accidental releases and improve safety related to the ammonia refrigeration system.  Any recommendations that were serious or high risk will be resolved before ammonia is introduced to the system.  All of the recommendations from this PHA will be resolved by October 2008."
