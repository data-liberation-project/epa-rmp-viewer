The dry scrubber is of a single shell construction featuring distinct areas for the storage of limestone and its contact with gases.  Gas enters the scrubber on one side and an internal baffle arrangement forces the gas to travel through the bed of cascading limestone.  Spent limestone is discharged via an extraction screw in the bottom of the scrubber\u0012s hopper to a disposal system.  The scrubber panel and the fan must be started manually.  The conveyor screw will be activated by a timer for 6 seconds every two hours and its daily operation will be verified with the DCS by means of a totalizer.

By establishing a joint venture production facility in Russia to process rare gases, ASG became a major supplier of these gases worldwide to the lighting aerospace industry.  The company has since successfully expanded its product offering to include specialty fluorinated and high purity hydrocarbon gases and has added value by transfixing and mixing these gases.  In that regard, the company has become one of the largest distributors of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in the Western United States.  ASG continues to pursue its original objective of identifying and capitalizing upon industrial gas market inefficiencies.  In pursuit of this objective, ASG began developing a manufacturing facility to produce Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3) in Dayton, Nevada and recently entered into joint venture to produce SF6 in South Africa for worldwide distribution.  A summary of ASG\u0012s operations is as follows:\n\nSan Francisco, California (1991) - Current headquarters and marketing offices.\n\nMoscow, Russia (1992) - Joint venture:  Akela.  A joint venture with AGA-Sweden and three Russian steel mills to separate and purify rare gases (xenon, krypton, neon).\nDayton, Nevada (1995) - Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3 ) production; SF6 transfilling, rare gas transfilling and mixtures.\nHouston, Texas (1996) - Joint Venture:  Specialty Chemical Products (SCP).  Production of specialty hydrocarbon mixes for high purity and calibration applications.  SCP will also repackage SF6  for distribution in the Southern United States.\nPelindaba, South Africa (1996) - Joint venture with Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC).  Production of fluorine and sulfur hexafluoride SF6 .\n\nNF3 Manufacturing Facility Site Information\n\nThe facility is located on approximately 5 acres off of Highway 50 in the Dayton Industrial Park, 28 Enterprise Way, Mark Twain area, about 3.5 miles east of downtown Dayton.

The maximum amount of nitrogen trifluoride per tube will not exceed 1,000 lbs of material.  \n\n2) Hydrogen Fluoride Background\n\nHydrogen fluoride is a colorless fuming liquid or gas with a strong irritating odor.  Hydrogen fluoride is a corrosive chemical and an inhalation hazard.  Hydrogen fluoride is shipped under its own vapor pressure.  Hydrogen fluoride is a strong acid and hence, it is used in many applications.\n\nThe most common applications are:\n\n7 As a raw material for CFC-alternatives.\n\n7 For the pickling process in the metal industry.\n\n7 As a glass etching agent.\n\n7 For the alkylation process in refineries.\n\nASG utilizes a 6,000 gallon storage tank and a 200 gallon intermediate storage tank.

This area is served by three gates, two in the front leading to Enterprise Way, and one in the back.\n\nNF3 Manufacturing Process\n\nASG employs a process which is known as in-situ electrolyte manufacturing process.  The raw materials, hydrogen fluoride and ammonia, are introduced into the reactor (electrolytic cell) which is already filled with potassium bifluoride as the acting electrolyte.  Electric power (DC) is fed to the reactor and nitrogen trifluoride is produced in the anodes chamber.  The material is then purified and filled into bulk storage tubes.  Hydrogen which is produced at the cathodes as a byproduct is also purified and then released to the atmosphere.\n\nBulk Chemical Storage\n\n1) Nitrogen Trifluoride Background\n\nNitrogen Trifluoride (NF3) is nonflammable and is usually shipped as a compressed gas.  It is inert and thermodynamically stable at ambient temperatures.  At high temperatures, its reactivity will become similar to elemental fluorine.  NF3 dissociates into NF2 and fluorine radicals.  Hence, it is a strong oxidizer and ideal for certain cleaning applications.  Upon inhalation of NF3 , physiological effects similar to those of carbon monoxide must be expected.  NF3  has had many uses in the past, the most notable being as an oxidizer in rocket fuel.  Though this use has been discontinued, other current applications include:\n\n7 As a fluorine source for high-energy lasers, preferable to pure fluorine because of its comparative ease of handling at ambient temperatures.\n\n7 As a chemical intermediate in the production of tetrafluorohydrazine and  perfluoroammonium salts.\n\n7 Cleaning in-situ CVD reactor tubes and fixtures used in semiconductor etching.

A concrete containment area holding approximately 32,000 gallons of liquid is surrounding both hydrogen fluoride bulk tanks.  Also installed is a water deluge system covering the entire containment area.  The system is designed to dump approximately 2,000 gpm of water onto the complete containment area, thus reducing the threat of HF vapors in the atmosphere.  Twenty-five Bete nozzles, model number N7, are installed at a height of 20 feet above the containment area with additional nozzles covering the flange area on top of the storage tanks and the truck unloading area.\n\nThe water flow is activated by the DCS when both sensors inside the containment area are in the alarm state (HF concentration >10 ppm).  Activation of the system can be observed on the CC TV monitor inside the control room, where a green light at the DCS panel also indicates that the water is flowing.  If the automatic activation of the system should fail and the situation calls for more flow, a manual override button at the DCS panel will also allow the activation of the deluge system.  Once the deluge system is activated, a timer set for 13 minutes will ensure that the water flow stops, preventing the containment area from overflowing.  The water flow can also be stopped by use of the manual override button.  The system is fitted with a fire department connection (FDC) for outside emergency water supply.\n\nSecondary HF Mitigation System\n\nThis system is a back-up for the primary mitigation system in case it cannot be activated for any reason whatsoever.\n\nThe back-up water system is designed to be completely independent from any energy or water source.  It consists of a 5,000 gallon water tank, a water pump and a fire water monitor aiming at the bulk storage tanks.  The system is capable of dumping the water tank\u0012s content into the containment ar"
