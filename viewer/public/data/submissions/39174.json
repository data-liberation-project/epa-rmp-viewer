Low and high pressure Cl2 gas from the Cl2 Circuits, from Cl2 pipelines, from many pressure relief devices is collected during upsets and is scrubbed with caustic to prevent atmospheric gas releases.? Flashed Cl2 liquid from storage and loading operations is routed to an evacuation system (sniff) and recovered by condensation or absorbed in sulfur chloride to recover Cl2.Chlorine gas releases are prevented by collection and removal with an emergency scrubber system, by use of an evacuation (Sniff) system of liquid lines and equipment and recycle of gas to the Cl2 recovery units, by low pressure storage of liquid Cl2 in high pressure storage vessels with pressure relief protection; excess flow checks for liquid line rupture, and by recycle and recovery of Cl2 from the Cl2 loading equipment.  A rigorous inspection and test program is used to assure the mechanical integrity of all process equipment and also to assure the availability of all safety systems.  A Process Safety Management program is in place to ensure that all facets of Process Safety are functioning properly to minimize the likelihood and magnitude for a Cl2 release.",

              "Description": "The Carbon Disulfide (CS2) production unit is divided into 6 separate process areas. Everything in this prevention program applies to all 6 areas, with the following exceptions:\n? The dates of the initial PHA?s were 2/9/04 for the Furnaces; 2/20/04 for the Absorber, 3/9/04 for the Still Line; 3/16/04 for Sulfur Recovery, 4/21/04 for CS2 Storage/Loading, which included CS2 Tank Car Vent Recovery, and 3/17/04 for the Emergency Flare.\n? CS2 is manufactured in totally enclosed, pressure vessels except that CS2 is stored in atmospheric tanks under a layer of water.\n? CS2 is very flammable and is co-produced and processed with H2S.  H2S monitors are used to detect leaks containing H2S.\nAll CS2 processing equipment is grounded and static electricity is avoided using electrically bonded piping.  CS2 leaks will autoignite at process conditions and can not form a potentially catastrophic-sized vapor cloud.  Autoignition results in a minor fire at the leak source.  CS2 product is stored at ambient temperature and pressure under a water layer to avoid any flammable vapor space. A N2 blanketing system is used as a secondary protection to the primary water protective layer.  All CS2 storage tanks are diked.  Water floats on liquid CS2 and would automatically suppress fire and evaporative loss.  Process equipment is protected by a fire water sprinkler system.  Process equipment is protected from over pressurization by pressure relief devices that relieve into a collection header that is directed to an Emergency Flare where CS2 is burned and vented at a high elevation.  CS2 is recovered from the loading operation by refrigerated condensation.  All product is shipped in pressure containers under a nitrogen blanket.\nA rigorous inspection and test program is used to assure the mechanical integrity of all process equipment and also to assure the availability of all safety systems.  A Process Safety Management program is in place to ensure that all facets of Process Safety are functioning properly to minimize the likelihood and magnitude for a CS2 release.",

PPG also follows the Responsible Care? Codes of Management Practice, including the Responsible Care? Community Awareness Code of Management Practice, and PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is \"to manufacture, sell, and distribute products worldwide in a manner that is safe and protective of our employees, neighbors, customers and other stakeholders, and the environment.\"\n\nRegulated substances handled\n\nThe Natrium facility is part of the Chlor-Alkali business group of PPG Industries, Inc.  Natrium is a principle producer of chlorine, sodium hydroxide, chlorinated organics, carbon disulfide, sodium sulfide, sodium hydrosulfide, and calcium hypochlorite.  Chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced concurrently by the electrolysis of salt dissolved in water in either a mercury cell or diaphragm cell.  Chlorine is used in the purification of drinking water, wastewater treatment, and several household products and as a powerful disinfectant.  Chlorine is widely used in the manufacture of many synthetic chemicals such as chlorinated solvents, refrigerants, pesticides, synthetic rubber, and household cleaners.  The Natrium facility has four applicable RMP toxic chemicals including chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and carbon disulfide.\n\nWorst-c"

The Natrium facility has no RMP applicable flammable chemicals.  The guidelines and Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as per 40 CFR 68.25 were utilized in this process.  Natrium used commercial software titled PHAST Professional, version 5.11, to determine off-site impacts from both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on dispersion modeling using PHAST 5.11 software and the EPA specified assumptions, off-site concentrations of chlorine would cause off-site impact.\n\nAlternative case release scenarios (ACRS) were developed for each of the listed chemicals in the facility.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used PHAST software to perform the end-point calculations.  The local emergency planning committee and office of emergency planning will utilize the ACRS information in conjunction with PPG experts to develop emergency response plans, train responders, perform practice drills and maintain the appropriate equipment.\n\nThe ACRS for chlorine evaluated a scenario where a chlorine railcar is moved during loading and a loading line is ruptured.  The quantity released of 376 pounds would be limited by check valves and automatic shutoff valves.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\nThe ACRS for carbon disulfide evaluated a scenario where an overflow of a carbon disulfide railcar occurs during loading.  Approximately 500 pounds of carbon disulfide would be released forming a pool and instantaneously evaporates.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\nThe ACRS for anhydrous ammonia evaluated a scenario where a liquid ammonia unloading hose ruptures during truck unlo"

No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\nThe ACRS for sulfur dioxide evaluated a scenario where a sulfur dioxide line develops a leak in a half inch line instrument fitting.  The operator would discover the leak on equipment rounds and isolate the leak.  The release rate would be 585 pounds over a 30 minute period.  No off-site impacts result from this scenario.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nTrained personnel and environmental, health and safety measures are included in all phases of the Natrium facility operation.  Detailed engineering and design standards are used.  These standards may include national codes and standards, quality assurance inspections, over pressure protection systems, flammable and toxic gas detectors, emergency shutdown systems, a fire water system and computer controls for the processes.  Employees at the facility receive job-appropriate training.  Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as appropriate.  Safety, environmental, operating and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates.  Additionally Management of Change (MOC) procedures assure review of proposed changes and ensure that training needs are met.  Operators and foreman actively participate with engineers that lead process hazard analyses to review potential hazards and to recommend additional safeguards if needed.\n\nThe Natrium facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs to minimize equipment or piping failures.  Inspections of equipment are scheduled at a frequency related to the equipment condition, the severity of the service environment, the required reliability or the manufacturers recommended schedule.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner. "

      "SummaryText": " This assures that the safeguards will function as intended if needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized and can include vibration monitoring, infrared imaging to detect differences in temperature, inspections by independent experts, inspections by insurance specialists and a root-cause analysis program.  Piping systems are inspected and tested with X-rays and/or hydrostatic tests.  The piping is monitored by a variety of methods.  Training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to different types of equipment.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThe Natrium facility has had four recordable injuries associated with a release of an RMP applicable chemical in the last five years since the original RMP submittal.  The incidents involved the release of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia and resulted in only minor inhalation injuries on-site.  There were no off-site impacts. \n\nEmergency response program\n\nThe Natrium facility maintains an Emergency Response Manual which addresses emergency planning and response.  Additionally, an Emergency Control Plan for the facility is included in the Process Safety Manual.  The Natrium facility has a trained on-site Emergency Response Team that is HAZWOPER certified and available for around the clock response to emergency incidents, provide emergency medical attention, fight fires, control chemical releases, and initiate road blocks and/or public emergency procedures.  Additionally, Natrium participates in regularly scheduled meetings with a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) and emergency responders regarding emergency response for the community.  There are also community emergency alarm systems in place at the facility to alert the public of an evacuation or shelter-in-place activation.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations.  For furth"
