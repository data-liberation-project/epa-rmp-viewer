This sub-cooling is achieved by the use of the refrigerators within the facility. Incoming drums for acetaldehyde are pressure rated and certified to the pressure rating required for the material.\nSecurity\nProcedural and physical security measures are in place to deter, detect and delay a threat. The complete security plan is outlined and discussed in the Advanced Biotech Security Plan and is considered confidential. Some highlights of the plan include: adequate illumination of the site; fencing to prevent unauthorized entry, secured gates on off hours; surveillance\ncameras; limited door/gate access; controlled access levels throughout the facility; etc.\nSummary of Security Plan\nSite access security is maintained by a front gate which is locked during non-business hours. Facility access security is\nmaintained via locked exterior personnel and shipping/receiving overhead doors. Visitors are required to enter through the\nfront entrance and sign in with the receptionist. No unescorted visitors are permitted in the material storage, operations or\nproduction areas. Delivery and shipment drivers check in with their respective loading docks for access to loading docks.\nThe Diesel Fuel storage tank and shipping and receiving areas employ continuous evening lighting activated automatically by\nphotoelectric sensors. This in combination with the fence serves to minimize the threat of vandalism in the tank area and the\nrest of the facility. Lighting also allows for evening detection of spills or leaks.\nExterior storage tanks are secured to prevent draining or spills due to vandalism.\nThe following is a list of some of the areas that are monitored 24/7/365 via a digital video camera system with long-term recording capability:\nFr"

The camera surveillance is also\nrecorded for later review as needed.\nSpill Prevention\nSpill prevention and abatement means utilized at ABT include verified leak-proof container closures and valves, secondary containment infrastructure in all areas of the facility as well as spill kits and absorbent materials at strategic locations. The site operates with 'zero discharge' from the Warehouse and Shipping/Receiving.\nSprinkler and Fire Protection\nABT's facility is fully sprinklered at the correct density and coverage for the materials stored including Acetaldehyde.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies and Procedures\nAdvanced Biotech, Inc. (ABT) has made an Executive Management commitment to prevent and control spills and releases demonstrated by implementation of a comprehensive emergency response program.\nSubstantial resources have addressed personnel training, accident/spill prevention and\nconsiderations for safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of equipment. Advanced Biotech, Inc.'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances for both worker and public safety.\nThe following operating procedures specifically apply to the covered Acetaldehyde process:\nSOP 2 - Acetaldehyde Handling\nSOP 11 - Chemical Control\nSOP 46 - Mix and Fill\nSOP 47 - Mixing Production Operations\nSOP 55 - Products needing Ventilation\nSOP 62 - Refrigeration and Refrigerated Products\nSOP"
