Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention\r\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and\r\nemployee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement\r\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases\r\nmay not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response\r\npersonnel at the local Fire Department to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\r\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is\r\nused as a refrigerant to support our process. The quantity of ammonia in the system is\r\napproximately 12,856 pounds.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\r\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA.
