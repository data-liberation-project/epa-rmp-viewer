Our belief in environmental stewardship is revealed in our policies and demonstrated through\n\nour actions. Our commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention\n\nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and\n\nemployee training associated with the processes in our facility. It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Although such releases\n\nmay not be foreseeable, our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response\n\npersonnel at the local Fire Department to control and mitigate the effects of any release should they\n\noccur.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products. Anhydrous\n\nammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. The entire ammonia inventory is\n\nused as a refrigerant to support our process. The quantity of ammonia in the system is\n\napproximately 12,856 pounds.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 by the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the\n\nOSHA, PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA, Section 302\n\nnotification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release\n\nprevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLineage Logistics maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the\n"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the\n\nchecklist methodology. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in\n\nengineering and process operations and will be re-validated at a regular interval of five years or\n\nsooner if required by the regulation. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a\n\ntimely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lineage Logistics\n\nmaintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such\n\nas initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency\n\noperations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed\n\nand is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLineage Logistics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\n\noperating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these\n\nprocesses. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLineage Logistics carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\n\nensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels,\n\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and\n\npumps. Maintenance procedures are performed by qualified personnel with a strong background in\n\nmaintenance practices. Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.
