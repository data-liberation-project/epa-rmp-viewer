      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for treating wastewater.  The Valley Sanitary Water District Water Reclamation Plant (VSDWRP) also uses chlorine for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations. VSDWRP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water.  VSDWRP's chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP \nExecutive Summary: \n\n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the VSDWRP chlorination system is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe VSDWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

Instead, the facility has coordinated with local response agencies to respond to any chlorine release that may occur at the plant.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe VSDWRP is located on 45-500 Van Buren Street, in Indio, California. The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 81 acres.  The Valley Sanitary District facility has operated since 1925.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 1.5 million gallons of water per day (mgd) to current capacity of 7.5 mgd.  The wastewater treated at Valley Sanitary district originates mainly from approximately 20,000 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Riverside county.   Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process and oxidation ponds to yield secondary effluents for purposes of re-use, and with post Chlorination for discharge.  The purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of water borne diseases by means of chemically treating the plant effluent to kill disease-causing organisms.  Anhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to a 2700-gallon  (16 ton) capacity storage tank located inside a chlorine shed.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present in the bulk storage tank at any given time is 13.5 ton (27,000 pounds).  In addition to the storage tank, the chlorination system consists of three chlorinators and injectors, piping and other equipment, and one chlorine detector with two sensors.  Gaseous chlorine s withdrawn from the bulk storage tank under its own pressure and flows through a pressure reducing valve, then a vacuum regulating valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the chlorine vapor flow to the injectors.  Chlorine vapor is pulled by vacuum created by a Venturi effect of the service water flow at the injectors.  The injecto"

Upon detection of approximately 1 ppmv chlorine, the chlorine analyzer will activate a yellow warning light and an audible alarm at the chlorine shed.  A signal is also transmitted to a central alarm system in the control building to activate the alarm on the auto dialer and show an alarm indicator on the auto dialer panel.  The chlorine leak detection system is equipped with aback up battery supply.\n\nThe plant is manned 10 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce offsite impacts.  The 13.5 ton (27,000 pounds) of chlorine over 10-minutes represents the worst-case release quantity for the single covered process at the VSDWRP.  Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of the bulk tank to only 27,000 pounds.  The release rate will thus b"

The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tank would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release has offsite impacts.  \n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nSince chlorine is the only regulated toxic substance used at the facility, one alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenario selected for the VSDWRP chlorination system involves the release of chlorine from the flexible hose connecting the storage tank to chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose which is worn or has a defect, which re"

It is assumed that approximately sixty minutes would be required for an emergency response team to respond and close the angle valve on the bulk storage tank.
