Therefore, emergency response organizations shall be provided with a current issue of the emergency response plan, and are invited to participate in annual emergency response exercises.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all hazardous materials stored on site are available to both site personnel and Edison Township emergency responders through our Hazard Communication Program. \n\n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe facility is covered by EPA-RMP regulations due to the presence of Titanium Tetrachloride at the facility.\n\n\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\nSite release prevention and chemical specific prevention includes process safety equipment, mitigation systems, and leak detection equipment, including a preventative maintenance program covering such equipment, an operator training program, and a Management of Change procedure.\n\nProcess safety equipment at the Edison Site includes relief devices such as relief valves and rupture disks, vents, check valves, quench systems, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, keyed bypasses, grounding and purge systems.\n\nMitigation systems in the accidental release prevention program include, dikes, sumps, sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains, a hazmat foam system, fire fighting foam systems, mineral oil dump systems, neutralization and fire water containment system.\n\nLeak detection systems are installed in process areas to detect toxic or flammable leaks.\n\nThe preventative maintenance program conducts inspections and tests to assure the operation of preventive devices.  Management of Change assures that all changes are reviewed for their hazards before implementation and considers the need for process safety equipment, mitigation equipment, and leak detection systems.  All incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and corrective actions are implemented to prevent future incidents.\n\nd) The five-year accident his"
