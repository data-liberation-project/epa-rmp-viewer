Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies \n\nWe at Ca?on City Water Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and \nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive\n accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, \ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training \nassociated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency \nresponse personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \nWe are also completely coordinated with Ca?on City Fire Protection District\n which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility which is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 6000 lbs.\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, \nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the \ndistances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we\n have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The following paragraphs provide \ndetails of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst-case analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Disinfection.  \nThe scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over \n10 minutes. The Release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 200. A distance to \nendpoint of 5.4 miles is obtained which affects  a residential population of 26577 \nwithin this distance.\n\n\nToxic Alternative-case analyses\n\nThe Alternative Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from Disinfection. \n The scenario involves the rele"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific \nPrevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release \nprevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. Our facility is also \nsubject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our \nstationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCa?on City Water Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information\nthat describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs \nsociated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with \nour processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to\ncarry out these analyses is  the What-If/Checklist method.  The studies are \nundertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and \nprocess operations and are revalidated periodically.  Any findings related to the \nhazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, \nCa?on City Water Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These \nprocedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal \noperations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, \nnormal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly "

New employees receive \nbasic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision\nuntil they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is \nprovided anually as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCa?on City Water Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance \nchecks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment \nexamined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks,\n piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls \nand pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with\nprevious training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are \noffered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified\nby the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCa?on City Water Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to \ndetermine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being \nimplemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any\ncorrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe\n and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCa?on City Water Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has \nresulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated \nsubstance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading \nto the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nreoccurring.
