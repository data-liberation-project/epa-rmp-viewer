This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n1.0 RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nOCI Beaumont LLC (OCI) operates an ammonia and methanol plant located at 5470 North Twin City Highway, Nederland, TX. The site uses chlorine for its process and produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and methanol on site that bring the facility under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. OCI has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials. The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals. OCI has also implemented an RMP and Emergency Response Plan to document how a response to a release at OCI is conducted and how the information is provided to the emergency response agencies. This submittal is the updated Risk Management Plan as the required 5-year resubmittal by OCI Beaumont LLC. OCI has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency. All these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at OCI Beaumont ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nOCI Beaumont LLC produces and stores anhydrous ammonia and uses chlorine for the water treatment process. These units have"

      "SummaryText": "similar prevention program elements and are included together in Section 7 of the RMPlan. Anhydrous Ammonia, Synthesis (Syn) Gas (mixture of Methane and Hydrogen), and Chlorine are PSM/RMP covered chemicals at the facility. The ammonia produced and stored is used primarily as an agricultural nitrogen fertilizer. Ammonia is produced at the site and transported by barge and truck. Ammonia is stored in two refrigerated Ammonia Tanks. Methanol is produced at the site using natural gas/syn gas mixture. \n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOCI Operations has developed an OSHA PSM/RMP program for OCI Beaumont Facility. At OCI Beaumont, ammonia, syngas and chlorine fall under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which overlaps with the OSHA PSM program. All the required elements of the OSHA PSM program are included in RMP Program 3. Reviews and assessments of the OCI Beaumont PSM program have shown it to be active and in line with RMP standards. The PSM/RMP program is documented in various procedures and policies which apply to each standard.\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe OCI Beaumont plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to facility personnel since it was recommissioned in 2012. There have not been any releases from the plant that required reporting under the RMP five-year accident history. In case of a reportable chemical accident, information in the RMP will be updated within six months of the date the accident occurred.\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nAs mentioned previously, the OCI Beaumont plant has developed an Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Response Plan is a detailed document which discusses the roles of employees and management and actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication;"

Some of these improvement plans include the establishment of integrity operating windows, conducting LOPC analysis and implementing actions to reduce LOPCs, developing ammonia unit corrosion control documents, and conducting a SIL assessment. Other improvements include issuing personal portable multi-gas detectors to all personnel that enters the field and implementing Life-Saving Rules Program."
