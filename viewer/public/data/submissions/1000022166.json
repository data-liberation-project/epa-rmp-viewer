Corporate policy dictates that facilities minimize the potential for adverse effects to the environment as well as to the health of employees and local citizens by operating plants safely. This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance procedures that are available to all employees. BPW stresses safe and environmentally sound operations in the employee training programs and in written materials available to employees.\n\nMethods of minimizing or reusing wastes, in addition to using energy and materials wisely, are encouraged. BPW is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use accidental release prevention programs to make sure our processes are managed safely, as well as to comply with regulatory requirements such as OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) and Contra Costa County's Industrial Safety Ordinance (ISO). However, if a release were to occur, we have prepared our personnel and local emergency response groups to respond to accordingly.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBPW produces high purity acids, etchants, and photoresist strippers for the semiconductor industry. Regulated substances managed on-site include anhydrous and aqueous ammonia, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride are used as feed stock in manufacturing processes. Anhydrous ammonia is used to manufacture ammonium fluoride. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used to manufacture electronic grade hydrofluoric acid. Aqueous ammonia and hydrochloric acid are received, stored and distributed to customers.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBPW has taken all the necessary step"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nBPW maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and, equipment specification sheets.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBPW conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled. The HAZOP methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyses. Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a five year basis. Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within BPW's covered process, written operating procedures are maintained. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is reviewed annually and is readily accessible to operators processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBPW has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the processes are competent in the associated operating procedures and safe work practices. Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years and more frequently as needed for required or updated process and safety topics.\n\n\n\nMechanical In"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance. These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nWritten procedures are in place at BPW to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to safely work with the modification.\n\n\n\nPrestartup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nPSSR related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted by appropriate personnel as a regular practice at BPW. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBPW conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis. These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel. Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBPW promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the rel"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBPW believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. BPW employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the accidental release prevention programs, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular. Safe job performance is required for all employees at the site.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, BPW hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. BPW has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform BPW of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. Contractors, however, are never engaged to operate the BPW processes.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases as defined by the RMP, CalARP or Contra Costa County Industrial Safety Ordinance programs from BPW within the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan (ERP)\n\nBPW utilizes a written ERP to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, BPW emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent chang"
