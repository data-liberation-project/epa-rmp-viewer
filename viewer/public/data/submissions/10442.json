Written operating procedures requiring daily, personal and mechanical moni-\ntoring are closely followed to prevent no more than 13,000 gallons of 152a/A-17.8218 from being present\nin a 18,000 gallon capacity, non-pressurized,outside, above ground storage tank. The storage tank is located in a fenced, secured area, an estimated 80' from the north wall of the facility. The storage tank area is video monitored 24 hours/day and 7days/week in addition to daily, physical  inspections by trained maintenance and security professionals and weekly physical inspections by trained production management and regulatory and safety professionals. Any deficiencies, regardless how insignificant, are immediately documented and followed up with immediate, appropriate, remedial action. Strict, monitored and enforced, performenced based, Good Manufacturing Practices and the state of the art active/passive detection, prevention and fire/explosion repression systems are utilized to minimize the possiblity of the remotest of loss scenarios. A significant underpinning of SLG's preventation philosophy is that complete compliance with local, state and federal regulations (EPA,OSHA,DFD,CSHD,etc.) is only the first step to a comprehensive, mult-faceted approach to the prevention, detection and control of loss potentials.
