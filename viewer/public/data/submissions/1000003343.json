These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.   Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.  \n\n\n\n    Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.  The facility will not respond to a leak but will evacuate.  Emergency Response will be conducted by the local fire department.\n\n\n\nThe total anhydrous ammonia inventory in this single process is 17,609 lbs.\n\n\n\nThe last accident was on 26 June 2012, there was a release of <15 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The accident was caused when an employee was removing ice from above ammonia piping without his supervisors' knowledge.  A large piece broke off and struck an isola"

The accident resulted in injury to three employees with no consequences off site.\n\n\n\nYork Cold Storage plans too follow the Process Management Program, and conduct its required inspections this will improve the safety of the plant and its systems.  Accident Investigations will be conducted immediately after an accident and the results will be transmitted to applicable employees and investigation recommendations will be implemented.\n\n\n\n    York Cold Storage is a facility in York, Nebraska which is a cold storage warehouse and food processing plant.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The system is operated as a two-stage system.  On the low stage portion of the system, a low temperature accumulator operating at -28?F pumps liquid to the blast freezers, freezers, and the ice room.  The low temperature ammonia liquid flows through coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the accumulator via a suction header.  Vapor from the low temperature accumulator is fed to low stage compressors. The compressed vapor from the low stage compressors is sent to an intercooler operating at +10?F. \n\nThe high stage portion of the system consists of a cooler, process coolers, and tempering.  Liquid flows from the high-pressure receiver to the accumulators, then through the coils where it picks up heat, changing the ammonia from a liquid to a vapor.  The low-pressure ammonia vapor is sent from the plant to the intercooler via a common suction header.  Vapor from the intercooler is then fed to the high stage compressors.  During the compression phase in the high stage compressors, the temperature of the ammonia vapor will rise as the pressure of the ammonia vapor is increased to approximately 150-180 psig. The high-pressure ammonia vapor flows from the high s"
