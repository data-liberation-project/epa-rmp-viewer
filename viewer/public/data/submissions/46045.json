Ammonia refrigeration plants are very different from complex chemical processing operations.  Many of the operations in chemical processing are not found in refrigeration plants.  There are no chemical reactions.  Moreover, ammonia refrigeration is a mature industry.  While there are new developments leading to more efficient operations, the design principles are fully available.  A complete understanding of the safe design and operating envelope is available to design practitioners in the industry.  Hazard reviews can result in findings or recommendations for improvements to prevent potential releases.  The management system includes that these findings or recommendations are promptly brought to resolution.  \r\n\r\nThe study will be re-evaluated at a regular interval of every five years or whenever major changes in the process are proposed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis will be addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nThe most recent review of hazards was performed on May 11, 2006.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Red Rock Ranch Inc. maintains written operating procedures through its outside refrigeration contractors and primary documentation of the equipment as provided by the manufacturer.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nRed Rock Ranch Inc. has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the refrigeration system process are competent in the operating"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on May 11, 2006.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified, contracted personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these contracted personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nCompliance audits provide a means by which the management of a plant assures itself that employees are properly carrying out their duties for preventing accidental releases.  \r\n\r\nRed Rock Ranch Inc. has conducted an audit for this first RMP submission to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  \r\n\r\nThis most recent compliance audit was conducted on May 11, 2006.  \r\n\r\nAdditional audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nRed Rock Ranch Inc. will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

This commitment is demonstrated by its accidental release prevention program that includes management practices in areas such as operating procedures, equipment maintenance, hazard analysis and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. \r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Red Rock Ranch Inc. to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nThe facility's primary activity is the temporary cold storage of fruits and vegetables.  There is one regulated substance present at this facility.  This substance is anhydrous ammonia and is used as a refrigerant in the cold storage refrigeration equipment.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of ammonia present and the ability to affect offsite receptors, this is a Program Level 2 RMP.  \r\n\r\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\r\n\r\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis, the EPA's RMP *Comp(TM) and 2000 US Census data for LandView 5 were used.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case:\r\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the receiver tank.  In this scenario 1,800 lbs. of Ammonia is released.  Ammonia liquefied under pressure is released to a pool with total vaporization assumed within 10 minutes.  A passive mitigation system was taken into account to calculate this scenario.  A rural setting was used in RMP Comp.  The regulatory required atmospheric conditions were used: Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second wind speed to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  \r\n\r\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is .6 mile"

At class D atmospheric stability and 3.0 meters/second wind speed, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia.  The release rates were increased until RMP Comp no longer gave the \u00bfless than\u00bf 0.1 miles for the scenario.  At a release rate of 180 lbs per minute RMP Comp calculates the endpoint to be 0.2 miles, not less than 0.1 miles.  At this rate the endpoint is definitely off the site.  Census data indicates there are no off-site receptors\r\n\r\nAlternative Most Likely Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of 540 lbs. of ammonia vapor from a shaft seal that is assumed to be controlled in 30 minutes at a release rate of 18 lbs per minute.  A passive mitigation control has been taken into account to calculate the scenario and the release is assumed to be controlled by the manual shutdown of the system.
