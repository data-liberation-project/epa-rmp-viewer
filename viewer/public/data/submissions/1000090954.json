              "Description": "Propylene is stored as a liquid in a vessel built to pressure vessel code.  The vessel is interconnected to a refrigeration unit which utilizes the propylene to reduce temperature to -300 F.  This cryogenic process separates the syngas into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which is consumed in other processes.  The storage vessel utilizes pressure relief devices and local LEL detection for protection.  The portions of the unit operations at cryogenic temperatures utilize materials designed for use at this temperature.  A firewater system with hydrant monitors allows this system to mitigate leaks.  The unit has a DCS control system which provides the operators with information, warnings and alarms that ensure safe operation.  Operators are trained to follow standard operation procedures that ensure safe operation during normal, abnormal and emergency situations.  LyondellBasell participates in a complex Emergency Response Team which allows trained responders to handle fire and hazardous materials response.",

This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at LyondellBasell La Porte. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled \n\nLyondellBasell produces several final products at the La Porte facility including methanol and syngas (which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). We have two regulated substances present at LyondellBasell La Porte in quantities greater than or equal to their threshold quantities (as listed below).\n\nPropylene\n\n1,3-Butadiene\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nLyondellBasell La Porte has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.
