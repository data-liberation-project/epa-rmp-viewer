EPI will take every reasonable action to prevent accidental releases. We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting processes available.\n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).  EPI will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment. Onsite employees are trained to evacuate the site and call the Fire Department if a VAM leak is detected. \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the liquid vinyl acetate monomer(VAM) system at this industrial plant. VAM (CAS No. 108-05-4) is the regulated substance handled at this facility. The VAM system has a maximum inventory of 233,000 pounds. This quantity qualifies the VAM system as a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Worse-Case Scenario.  The worst case scenario is the rupture of the largest VAM tank. The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 10,000 gallons of liquid VAM to be released into the containment dike.  In the worst-case scenario, this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents.  VAM would convert to a gas at the rate of 24.2 pounds per minute. Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.36 miles.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of VAM a leaking pipe. Such a release could yield a release of 4 pounds per minute of VAM gas.  Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.14 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting. The VAM system was designed according to codes and specifications, and adheres to good operating practice. The operators and contractors who work in and around the VAM equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures. We have"

      "SummaryText": "a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the VAM equipment.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The Plant has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of VAM. Employees are trained to evacuate the facility and call the Fire Department when a VAM leak is detected.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from offsite responding agencies. The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release. The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to VAM. The ERP was last reviewed on May 26, 2004. ERP training for all employees was last conducted in 2003. The ERP is coordinated with the Bainbridge Fire Department."
