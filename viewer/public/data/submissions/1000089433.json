Responders are trained to enter an IDLH condition.  Responders are also trained to the (300 PPM) Air Purifying Respirator level.  Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases.  Detailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel.  All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  The emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified.  The Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA's Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's Process Safety Standard,  EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Contingency Plan and Hazardous Materials Plan(HMBP) \u00acCCR Title 8 and Title19\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  Second, all Americold's, Monterey Fish and Cal-Pacific's employees (direct hires, contract) receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.  (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n6.\tImplementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by the Management of Change Procedure.  If a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Americold has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history.  Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Americold's Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.

The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.
