In the event of a\nsignificant accidental release, Mahrt evacuates workers and\ncontains the release to prevent and or reduce the\nconsequences of the release.\n\n1.2  The MeadWestvaco Corporation-Mahrt and Regulated\n     Substances\n\nMahrt is a paper mill without bleaching operations,\nproducing coated unbleached Kraft paperboard, known as\nCoated Natural Kraft for use in multiple beverage packaging\nand folding cartons for food, pharmaceuticals and other\nproducts.  Mahrt mill produces two grades of Coated Natural\nKraft paperboard:  Carrier Kote for beverage packaging and\nCustom Kote for folding cartons.  More than half of the\nmills total production is Carrier Kote.  The covered process\nis defined as a regulated substance present in more than a\nthreshold quantity as determined under 68.115 and includes\nany use, storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site\nmovement of such substances, or combination of these\nactivities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group\nof vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels,\nwhich are located such that a regulated substance could be\ninvolved in a potential release, shall be considered a\nsingle process.  The facility handles one substance\nregulated by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be\ncovered by the RMP rule:\n     -Aqueous Ammonia stored in the Color Plant area for use\non the Paper Machines\n\nAs a result of the use of the regulated substances at Mahrt,\nthe following process is covered by the RMP rule:\n                    Process- Aqueous Ammonia\n                    Program Level- 1\n                    Regulated Substance- Ammonia (29wt. %)\n                    Process Quantity- 32,190\n\n1.3  Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe RMP rule requires the Mahrt mill to perform an off-site\nconsequence analysis for the following scenarios\n               -    One worst case scenario for the toxic substance ammonia"

The worst case release\nscenario for the toxic substances is failure of the 15,000\ngallon (32,190 lbs) aqueous ammonia (29% wt) storage tank in\nthe rail car unloading area.  A diked area contains the\nrelease aqueous ammonia, which evaporates, forming a vapor\ncloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint\nconcentration is .30 mile.  No public or environmental\nreceptors are located within this distance of storage tank.\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical\n     Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMahrt maintains a number of programs to help prevent\naccidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident\nprevention programs in place at Mahrt include:\n\n     Safety information.  Mahrt maintains a variety of\ntechnical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation of the processes at Mahrt.  Material safety data\nsheets (MSDS's) document the physical properties of\nhazardous substance handled at Mahrt, including the\nregulated substance in covered process.  The information\nincludes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits,\nphysical data, reactivity data, corrositivity data, thermal\nand chemical stabilility data and the hazards of mixing\nsubstances in the process.  The engineering design documents\ninclude the operating parameters, the design basis and\nconfiguration of the equipment in each covered process and\nreferences to applicable codes and standards.\n\n     Hazard Review.
