Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia which is considered hazardous materials.  The properties of the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia; the safety devices and system designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the CSDS facility to charge the central refrigeration system, provide product cooling during processing in silos and tanks, produce ice for a ice bank used for the chilled water generation for process uses, and provide cooling and freezing areas in the cold storage warehouse.  The majority of the anhydrous ammonia equipment is located in and around the Mechanical Equipment Room and the cold storage warehouse. The system is totally contained and the only losses of ammonia requiring delivery of makeup quantities are from small fugitive emissions at valve stems and pump seals, residual ammonia gas pumped out of a section of the system prior to maintenance or repair; small amounts of ammonia gas lost during manual purging of air and removal of oil from the ammonia, and discharges from relief valves.  Operation of the system is automatic through controllers that sense level, temperature, and pressure at various points in the system.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance are considered as part of one complete process.\n\n3a.  Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe high pressure receiver is the largest vessel in the refrigeration system with the anhydrous ammonia.  The Worst Case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease scenario to be modeled assumes that the full 12,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are released over a ten-minute period resulting in a release rate of 1,250 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the Worst Case release scenario extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b.  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release scenario for the anhydrous ammonia system assumes a release from a ruptured disk/relief valve failure, resulting in the release of 98 pounds of ammonia over a one-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.14 mg/l for the Alternative Release scenario for anhydrous ammonia extends beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.  \n\n3c.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the anhydrous ammonia systems and the training provided to the refrigeration system operators.\n\n3d.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the refrigeration system with the anhydrous ammonia and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention pr"

      "SummaryText": "ogram.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services incorporates this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) that are being implemented at this time for the next year.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
