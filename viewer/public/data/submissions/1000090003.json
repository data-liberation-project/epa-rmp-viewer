Remote operations are conducted out of the Galena 3 control room located in Reno, NV. On site staff will typically consist of one plant operator, two maintenance personnel and two electrical personnel which are shared between the Desert Peak II facility and the Brady facility. Additional operational, maintenance, management and administrative support will be provided to the Desert Peak II facility from the Steamboat Complex located in Reno, NV. The Desert Peak II facility will operate continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).\n\n \n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nDesert Peak II stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The total maximum amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 260,133 pounds. \n\n \n\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been developed for the Desert Peak II facility.

The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition. Preventative maintenance tasks and procedures are scheduled to be undertaken over a series of maintenance intervals. The Mechanical Integrity Program will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts. Alarm system maintenance is determined using a combination of regulatory requirements, manufactures recommendations, plant operating experience and best practices. \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures: give detailed safe oprating instructions on Safety Information, Precautions, and Normal Operations, Plant Startup and Shutdown and Emergency Operations.

Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\n\n\n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tank and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with \"telltale\" gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \n\n    \n\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-pentane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors and well ventilated.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the Desert Peak II OEC units have extensive fire protection, detection, and alarming systems as well as an administrative control system aimed at fire prevention.\n\n\n\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OEC's, and ultraviolet/infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-pentane storage tank. The fire water systems consist of fire monitors and hydrants.
