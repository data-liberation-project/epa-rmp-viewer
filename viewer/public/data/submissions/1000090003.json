In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The total maximum amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 260,133 pounds. \r\n \r\nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel.

The Desert Peak II facility actively manages all operational permits and safety programs such as Nevada Department of Environmental Protection Air Quality, Chemical Accident Prevention Program, Underground Injection Control as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management. In addition, Ormat is ISO 14000 and 9001 certified and undergoes several audit processes to ensure all facilities are aggressively pursuing the highest quality, safety and environmental standards. Ormat is committed to handling the n-pentane systems in a safe manner to protect the environment. Copies of emergency response, process hazard analyses, Chemical Accident Prevention Program and process safety management plans and all technical drawing (P&IDS) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.\r\n\r\nFacility Description \r\nThe Desert Peak II Geothermal Power Plant is wholly owned by ORNI 3, LLC. which is a division of Ormat Technologies, Inc., a publicly traded company. Desert Peak II is located in Churchill County. The physical plant is located off the Nightingale exit on Interstate 80 east of Fernley Nevada. The leased acreage covers the defined geothermal resource area and receptive injection zones.\r\n\r\nDesert Peak 2 consists of one water cooled OEC rated at approximately 7.7 MW (gross), and one air cooled OEC rated at approximately 14 MW.

Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\r\n\r\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tank and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of its corresponding relief valve. Individual relief valve locations are equipped with telltale gauges in between the relief valve and its rupture disk to allow easy identification of leaking or blown rupture disks. \r\n\t\r\nVentilation System Design: All components of the n-pentane transfer and storage systems and the OEC units are located outdoors and well ventilated.\r\n\r\nSafety Systems: Beyond the relief system the Desert Peak II OEC units have extensive fire protection, detection, and alarming systems as well as an administrative control system aimed at fire prevention.\r\n\r\nThe fire detection systems include gas monitors which continuously monitor the area surrounding the OEC's, and ultraviolet/infrared flame detectors throughout the plant. The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-pentane storage tank.
