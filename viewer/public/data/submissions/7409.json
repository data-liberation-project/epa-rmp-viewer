Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\n  As a result of information gathered during preparation of this CaIARP, Mountain Water Ice (MWI) Company is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the MWI's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, MWI is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and O"

      "SummaryText": "ff-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the MWI Carson facility refrigeration system. The majority of liquid ammonia is stored in three (3) vessels (Liquid Sub-Cooler (SC-I), Recirculating Package #1 (RC-I) and Recirculating Package #2 (RC-2). The liquid is circulated as needed to the icemakers or air handling units where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 PPM. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and majority of the piping are inside the Carson facility's building. The mitigating measures (i.e., vessel inside facility, vessels in a containment pit) existing at the facility are incorporated into the computer Heavy gas modeling (Aloha) of the 'Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis as is permitted in the new EPA release Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration 40 CFR part 68.  The Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis used here does not incorporate mitigating effects and uses the Gaussian dispersion model.  There is a multitude of engineering and Administrative Safeguards (i.e., high level cutouts, vessel size, and system operation) that were used to determine worst case and alternative release amounts possible.\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of this RMP. Mountain Water Ice Company has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their new facility (Located in the Program Element Binder Section 12). The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the new facili"

MWI conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan.\n\nAddressing the five-year accident history is not an issue, since the facility was just commissioned May 1998. No accidents have occurred since its commissioning. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Mountain Water Ice Company is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventative Program 3) developed in April 1998 for their new facility in Carson, California. The Preventative Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure the new system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nMountain Water Ice Company will address and incorporate into processes and procedures any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations and program audits. The flexibility of the program will allow MWI to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing MWI employees, the surrounding public, and /or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
