Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update in accordance with the rule.  All accident prevention elements have been reviewed and/or updated.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural fertilizer retail.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a Contractor owned and operated commercial tanker truck.  The Contractor transfers anhydrous ammonia from the commercial tanker truck to two stationary pressure vessels (PV).  \r\n\r\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia in one stationary PV and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the PV to nurse tanks at the point of retail sale to the end user (i.e. Grower/Farmer).  Trained Process Operators perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.    \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated a"

The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a 30-second release from a violent rupture of a 3-inch transfer hose caused by an impact or pull-away during a transfer operation.  This alternative scenario considers active mitigation of the safety equipment (i.e. emergency shutoff and excess flow valves on the commercial tanker truck; and backflow check valve, emergency shutoff valve, and excess flow valves on the PV side of the bulkhead), and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard against releases from ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Warehouse Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Warehouse Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Warehouse Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
