We are a grower\nand processor of poultry and poultry products. When fully staffed,\nwe employ 325 people at the Fredericksburg operation. Our product\nline consists of smoked and fully cooked turkey and chicken\nproducts which are shipped thoughout the continental United States\nas well as exported to many countries overseas.\n\nSunday House was purchased by Mission City Management, Inc. in 1992\nand has remained in operation since that date. The company continues\nto do business as Sunday House Foods Inc. with joint ownership in\nboth the San Antonio and Springfield, Missouri areas.\n\nWe provide the required \"worse case release\" and \" alternative\nrelease\" scenarios for our operation as follows:\n(These scenarios were created using RMP COMP (tm) provided by the\nEPA)\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nA.) Accidental release of ammonia (NH3)\nB.) The physical state of this release was gas liquefied by\n    refrigeration.\nC.) The quanity released was 12.000 pounds.\nD.) The rate of release was 1,2000.0 per minute.\nE.) The release duration was 10.0 minutes.\nF.) The wind speed was 1.5 miles per hour.\nG.) Our atmospheric stability class is F.\nH.) Our topography surroundings are urban.\nI.) The distance to the endpoint is 0.60 miles\nJ.) The estimated residential population within distance to the\n    endpoint is 64 residents.\nK.) We have public receptors within distance to the endpoint.\nL.) We have no environmental receptors within the distance to the\n    endpoint.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA.) Accidental release of ammonia (NH3).\nB.) The physical state of this release was gas liquefied by\n    refrigeration.\nC.) The quanity released was 1,000 pounds.\nD.) The reate of release was 100.0 pounds per minute.\nE.) The release duration was 10."

We have no environmental receptors within the distance to the\n    endpoint.\n\nWe fall under the federal mandated Process Safety Management\nProgram (P.S.M.) We also follow O.S.H.A. as well as the IIAR\nguidelines closely. We have several safe guards in place to\nmonitor the pressure in our ammonia system and automatically\nreact in the case of a problem. We have maintenance employees on\nduty (on site) or on call 24 hours per day and seven days per week.\nWe also have a 5 person Haz-Mat Team (Hazardous Material Handling\nTeam), with full Haz-Mat equipment at our Fredericksburg plant.\nThey receive training on an annual basis from the Fredericksburg\nFire Department.\nWithin the last 5 years, we have had two accidental releases of\nammonia with the first occurring December 15,1997 in which\napproximately 400 pounds of ammonia was released. This was due\nto a stuck valve which allowed ammonia to enter the compressor\nheads causing the compressor to blow. The plant was evacuated.\nThe second incident happened August 18,1998 in which\napproximately 500 pounds of ammonia was lost due to a faulty valve.\nThe plant was evacuated for three hours.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to participate in the Risk Management\nProgram.\n\n\n\nRichard Dillow\nPresident\nSunday House Foods"
