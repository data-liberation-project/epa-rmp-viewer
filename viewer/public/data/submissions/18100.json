Brewer and Company, Limited, the parent company, issued a policy guide on October 9, 1992 for all subsidiaries to follow.  The policy is a commitment to environmental compliance which assigns the responsibility of implementing the policy to the Chief Executive Officer of the company, or designated individual or individuals to ensure compliance.  The purpose of the policy is to provide employees with a safe and healthy environment and at the same time protect, preserve and improve the environment.\n\n      The facility's overall approach to chemical safety begins with the premise that safety is everyone's responsibility.  Preventing injuries and incidents is good business and working safely is a condition of employment.  Workplace hazards are minimized through preventive measures such as facility and equipment design, purchase of less hazardous products and development of standard operating procedures.  Control measures include facility inspections to discover potential problems, employee reports of hazardous conditions through a \"Stop Card\" program, training and a safety award program.  Effective April 1, 1999 a new safety recognition program was established.  The program consist of quarterly incentives (the longer a team is accident free, the better the awards) for each team that is accident free.\n\n     There is a strong senior management commitment to safety and the implementation of safety  programs.  However, there is an effort to get management more involved in day to day safety activities through participation in \"Tailgate\" safety meetings and emergency response team activities.\n\nb.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substance.\n\n     The Brewer Environmental Industries, LLC - Port Allen Annex is a 33,000 square feet property leased from Alexander and Baldwin, Inc for the storage of bulk liquid fertilizers and anhydrous ammonia (Highest quantity is 55,000 lbs. and average monthly quant"

Staff from the Puhi facility provides the manpower when work is required and for daily check of the facility.  The products are stored and distributed to customers on the Island of Kauai.\n\n     The site, located in the Port Allen Industrial area, Port Allen, Kauai, Hawaii, is leased from Alexander and Baldwin, Inc. and consist of approximately 33,000 square feet.  The site is surrounded by industrial land to the north, east, west and south. Beyond the south boundary, approximately 0.5 mile, is the Pacific ocean . \n\nc.     Release Scenarios.\n\n1.      Worst Case.\n        \n          The release scenario is the total release of the largest quantity of anhydrous ammonia from a one ton cylinder.  There is no passive mitigation and the release occurs under the worst weather conditions (F stability, wind speed at 1.5 meters per second).\n\n        The offsite consequence analysis was conducted for anhydrous ammonia utilizing the OCA Guidance to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which is 0.81 mile.  There will be impacts on residential population, public receptors and other commercial operations.\n\n        There are no administrative or passive mitigation systems to limit the quantity of releases.  There are operational procedures for storage and handling of cylinders to minimize the possibility of causing damage to cylinders and making the worst case release unlikely.  Active mitigation is the use of large volumes of water directly on the leak and maintain contact until the valve is shut off or until the contents have been discharged and the tank is empty,\n         \n2.     Alternative Scenario.\n\n        The alternative scenario of a valve leak was selected because that is the most likely area vulnerable to damage due to dropping or mishandling of a cylinder.  There is no passive mitigation and the release c"

The OCA Guidance was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which is 0.06 mile.  There is no impact on residential population, public or environmental receptors.  There will be an impact on surrounding  commercial companies.\n\n        There are no administrative or passive mitigation systems to limit the quantity of releases.  Active mitigation is the use of water hose streams on the valve leak to enable the employee to shut off the valve or, in situations where leaks cannot be valved off,  use of large volume of water directly on the leak until the contents of the tank have been discharged and the tank is empty.  \n             \nd.     Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps.\n\n       The facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  A process safety management plan was written for the facility which include all of the required elements.  Since the process is storage only, the practices important to the prevention program are the proper storage and handling of the cylinders.  Dry, isolated and fire proof storage spaces are provided.   Proper loading and unloading of cylinders from trucks are very important to prevent cylinders from falling and cause possible damage to the valve area.  Training and careful work practices are the key to preventing accidental damage to the cylinders.\n     \ne.     Five Year Accident History.\n\n       The facility has not experienced any accidents during the past five years.  This is understandable because the process is storage only with minimal handling of the cylinders.\n\nf.     Emergency Response Program.\n\n       The facility emergency response plan covers both accidental releases and natural disasters.  The plan set forth policies and procedures for responding to emergencies and incorporate the following:\n\n      1.  Personnel roles, lines of authority, training and communication (including notif"

Natural disasters are coordinated with the State and Kauai CountyCivil Defense agencies.\n\n     Personnel receive ammonia response, HAZWOPER and HAZMAT training.  Ammonia response and HAZWOPER training are conducted annually and the HAZMAT training is conducted every three years.\nWeekly tailgate meetings at the Puhi facility are also held covering various safety topics.  These meetings are short 15-20 minute meetings.\n\n     The alert system is basically the use of air horns and messenger.  Truck drivers away from the facility will be contacted by cellular phone.  The plant superintendent is the Incident Commander and determines the level of emergency condition.  The following are the various levels of emergency conditions:\n                          \n     Level I is a potential emergency condition which is limited to a confined area and can be controlled by \n     a  first responder.
