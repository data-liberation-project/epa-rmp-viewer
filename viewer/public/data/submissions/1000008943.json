Release Considerations\nFollowing program guidelines a \u00c2\u00bfWorse Case\u00c2\u00bf release of ammonia was analyzed.  Also, several alternative (much more likely to occur) releases were considered.  Both the worse and alternate cases were documented in a report.

It is the policy of Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC emergency action plan involves the preparation of action procedures and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of ammonia releases.\nWe have trained the refrigeration personnel in hazardous materials response (24 hours).  This training includes emphasis on anhydrous ammonia, in addition to other requirements set forth in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) and WAC 296-62, Part P (HAZWOPER).\n\nAt Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\u00c2\u00b7\tPrevent unnecessary human exposure\n\u00c2\u00b7\tReduce the threat to our personnel\n\u00c2\u00b7\tReduce the threat to the community\n\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 1151 Cutler Way Zillah, WA  98953.  The facility is located in Yakima County.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nBorton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC believes in the concept set forth in the General Duty Clause of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, Borton Fruit Zillah Plant, LLC has established policies, procedures and training to"
