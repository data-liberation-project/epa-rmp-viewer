      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION:\n\nThe Aurora Foods, Inc. (\"Aurora\") facility is located at 96 Quaker Oats Drive, Jackson, TN. The facility is approximately 30 years old and was historically owned/operated by the Quaker Oats Company. Quaker Oats Company developed the Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") for the facility in 1994/1995. In the late 1990s, the facility was owned/operated by Van De Kamps (\"VDK\") Frozen Foods. The original Risk Management Program was developed by VDK using the existing PSM and the initial Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\") was submitted to EPA on June 15, 1999.\n\nAurora became the owner/operator of the facility in June 2000 and a new management team was installed at the facility.  The PSM policy manual was updated in July of 2001.  An audit of the Risk Management Program in October 2001 by EPA revealed several issues with the Program that resulted in a Clean Air Act Compliance Order.  Unfortunately, the existing operating procedures and the 2001 PSM policy manual were not shown to the EPA during the audit.  In accordance with the Order, the Program has been reviewed and updated and the RMP is being re-submitted to reflect these revisions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\nAurora is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. As documented in Aurora's Corporate Compliance Program and Corporate Code of Conduct, the company is committed to making the work environment safe, secure and healthy for employees and others. Aurora is also committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment.\n\nAs part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, Aurora has an Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual which provides instructions and responsibilities required of all facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury; ammonia release; fire; and severe weather. The manual also provides pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the Aurora facility.\n\nAurora maintains a well trained and equiped staff of 9 refrigeration mechanics. Each of the refrigeration mechanics has a minimum of 6 years of experience with ammonia refrigeration systems. A minimum of two refrigeration mechanics are at the facility at all times. All refrigeration mechanics are trained as \"Hazardous Materials Responders\" under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 and receive annual refresher training. The Maintenance Supervisor-Plant Services is trained as the \"Hazardous Material Incident Commander\" and has over 20 years of experience with ammonia refrigeration systems. Appropriate personnel protective equipment including respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (\"SCBA\") are available on-site for response to ammonia incidents. Aurora is committed to maintaining a well trained and prepared response team.\n\nFACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe facility is located on 102 acres in southeast Jackson, TN.  The facility consists of several connected buildings with over 300,000 square feet under roof. Aurora produces and freezes waffles, french toast, pancakes, pizzas, and fish. Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the facility process. The operating capacity of the refrigeration system is between 180,000 and 220,000 pounds of ammonia.  No other Risk Management Program regulated substances (toxic or flammables) are located at the facility.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the facility is the loss of the entire contents of ammonia vessel V-21 due to a catastrophic failure of the vessel and/or the associated vacuum pumps. The capacity of this vessel is 56,000 pounds of  liquid ammonia which is maintained at a vacuum. V-21 is located within a 2,000 square foot room within the facility and the building w"

Based upon the RMP*COMP model, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L would be at a distance of 2.0 miles from the facility. Public receptors are located within this endpoint distance.\n\nAurora considered a variety of worst-case scenarios and the loss of V-21 resulted in the largest distance to the toxic endpoint.  V-21 is operated under a vacuum and is unlikely to rupture because it is not under pressure. Mechanical integrity procedures ensure that the vessel and associated pumps and piping are maintained in good condition.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nAurora has evaluated several alternative release scenarios using vessels, piping, and valving within the ammonia system. The selected alternative release scenario is the loss of 10,000 pounds of ammonia due to a truck transfer hose failure during the off-loading of an ammonia shipment. This scenario was identified by the PHA and it is generally considered, due to the number of variables in this process, as being more likely to occur than other scenarios.  This activity takes place outside of the facility.  Under this alternative release scenario, the entire contents of the truck would be lost at a rate of 1,000 pounds per minute for 10 minutes. Based upon the RMP*COMP model, the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L would be at a distance of 0.2 mile from the facility. Public receptors are located within this endpoint distance. \n\nDuring transfer of ammonia from truck to the facility, the entire process is observed by an Aurora refrigeration mechanic and the truck driver. Both are trained to respond to ammonia releases. An ammonia transfer procedure is followed to minimize the potential for releases and in the event of a release, it is unlikely that the entire contents of the truck (10,000 pounds) would be released.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nAur"

      "SummaryText": "ora has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM  and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage.  A management system has been established to maintain the elements of the PSM and Risk Management Programs.  Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Management Program are readily accessible by employees.  In accordance with the program PSI information was recently updated in May 2002, however, this minor update did not effect the March 2002 PHA.  The ammonia system is maintained by computerized compressor control systems and 24-hour per day operator attention to the system. An automatic ammonia detection system (\"ADS\") also provides reliable notification of ammonia releases.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nAurora has not had an accident with the ammonia system.  Quaker Oats, the former facility owner, had a small release on November 1, 1994 which was reported in the June 1999 RMP submittal.  For the purposes of this 2002 RMP submittal, only minor incidents have occurred and no accidential releases resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in-place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred at the facility within the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual. If a release of ammonia is detected by the ADS or by employees, the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration mechanics) by radio and as required, the involvement of the incident commander. The manual describes the level of personnel protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents.  Facility responders have received initial and annual refresher training  in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation r"

Aurora will work with these agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel, off-site emergency contacts, and adjacent plants.  Media relations will be handled by senior management.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nWithin the next four months, the PSM will be transferred to an Internet site  to improve employee accessibility and recordkeeping. Additional Aurora personnel will be trained as  \"Hazardous Material Incident Commanders\" within the next month. Facility-wide evacuation drills will be conducted within the next month.  A considerable number of valves, piping runs, vessels and other equipment has been replaced at this facility over the past seven months.  Pipe-thickness testing is scheduled to be performed by the end of 2002 to further support this process and confirm the mechanical integrity of the system."
