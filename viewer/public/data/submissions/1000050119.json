Accidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nThe Town of Ocean City Division of Public Works accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the US EPA Prevention Program are adhered too.  The Division of Public Works and Emergency Management continue to evaluate and improve its procedures and practices with regards to its accidental release prevention policy.\n\n\n\n    The Division of Public Works and Emergency Management response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nB. System Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe Gorman Avenue Water Treatment Plant provides the Town of Ocean City with potable (drinking) water.  The Gorman Avenue Water Treatment Plant is located on Gorman Avenue (137th Street west of Coastal Highway bayside) and Sinepuxent Avenue in Ocean City, Maryland.  Disinfection of water is part of the water treatment process required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the State of Maryland.  At the Gorman Avenue (WTP), disinfection is accomplished with chlorine treatment.\n\n    Chlorine liquid is stored and handled at the Gorman Avenue WTP for disinfection process.  The WTP chlorination system has a chlorine storage room and a chlorination room.  Equipment at the facility includes liquid chlorine containers, chlorine gas manifolds, a vacuum feed system, chlorinators, safety equipment, chlorine leak detectors and an emergency scrubber system.\n\n    Typically eight (8) one-ton containers are on site.  Two (2) of the eight containers are hook-up online.  The WTP is normally manned when on-line.  (Note this plant does not operate year round).  WTP operators visit the facility daily when not on line and respond to any t"

Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Offsite Consequence Analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as \"Worst-Case Release and \"Alternative Scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, stating that, \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel, one-ton container, is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario.\"  The Offsite Consequence Analysis for the Gorman Avenue WTP was conducted with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\n1. Based on the tables and information provided for a worst-case chlorine release, the following was determined:\n\ni. The \"Worst-Case Release Scenario,\" as defined by EPA, would be for a one-ton container of chlorine to release, as a gas, in a ten-minute period.\n\nii. The toxic endpoint for the chlorine gas is 3 ppm.\n\niii. Passive mitigation can be expected from the building housing the chlorine and this will reduce the release rate by 45%.\n\niv. The distance from the release site to the toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles  (It should be noted that the design of the chlorine feed system [vacuum feed] and the presence of an emergency scrubber system make the possibility of the EPA described \"worst-case\" scenario practically impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The \"Alternative (Release) Scenario\" was evaluated with the use of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  For the Gorman Avenue WTP a possible alternative release scenario would be a pressure relief valve release through a 1/2 inch i.d. chlorine gas pipe.  Such a leak would not have an impact outside the facility boundaries.  The reason for this is because of the active mitigation measures that are in place.  These are:\n\ni. Vacuum feed system and pressure relief vents\n\nii. Building enclosure provid"

The general Gorman Avenue WTP accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are based on the Town of Ocean City's program and consists of the following key elements:\n\n1. Highly skilled and trained operators (State licensed)\n\n2. Preventive Maintenance Program\n\n3. Use of State -of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n4.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo reportable accidental release of chlorine has occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Gorman Avenue WTP has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Town of Ocean City Public Works Division and Emergency Management, which include the Public Safety Group (Fire Company, Emergency Medical Services, Police, Coast Guard, Hazardous Materials Team, Emergency Management and Public Works Division).  The program includes an organizational structure of emergency responders and their responsibilities.  Emergency response to a leak at the Gorman Avenue WTP would include selected and trained personnel from all the Public Works and Public Safety Groups.  Emergency-response drills and emergency-response procedure evaluations are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHandling procedures and emergency response procedures will be evaluated annually over the next five years.
