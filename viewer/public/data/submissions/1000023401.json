Denver Water takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of systems using hazardous substances, and the safe handling of water treatment chemicals. Denver Water has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response. These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nDenver Water management, as a public utility, recognizes the importance of providing a safe working environment, and taking all reasonable measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community. This understanding is reflected in the design of the facilities, the commitment to training and the procedures described and referenced in the RMP manuals.\n\n\n\nApplicable Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nFoothills Water Treatment Plant treats up to 280 million gallons per day. The regulated hazardous substance stored at this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the treatment process to ensure the water we serve to our customers is safe to drink. The chlorine is stored on site in three 20-ton tanks. The maximum intended inventory is 120,000 pounds.  \n\n  \n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Foothills Water\n\nTreatment Plant RMP manual. The prevention programs include the following elements:\n\n- Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in th"

All recommendations from the Hazard Analysis are being addressed and will be completed in Oct and November of 2011.\n\n- Operating procedures for applicable processes are maintained at the plant.\n\n- Training for all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system.\n\n- Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) Incident associated with the chlorine system, using the Denver Water Incident Investigation Report procedures.\n\n- Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure the continued compliance of the Foothills Water Treatment Plant RMP programs.\n\n\n\nIn addition to these elements, the chlorine storage room at the plant is equipped with a chlorine scrubber,which will evacuate chlorine-laden air from the chlorine storage and feed areas, reducing the concentration of chlorine gas to safe levels prior to discharge to the atmosphere. The scrubber will pull vapors out of both\n\nthe chlorine storage and feed rooms. An exhaust fan pulls air into the scrubber and into a multistage chamber, exposing it to caustic spray and a mist eliminator prior to discharge to the exhaust stack. The scrubber has an exhaust detector to monitor the chlorine concentration in the discharge stack. Dampers allow for makeup air to enter the chlorine storage and feed rooms, replacing air that is pulled through the scrubber. The scrubber's discharge stack is curved downward at its exhaust point to prevent water from getting in. The end of this vent stack is 6 feet above the roofline. Overall scrubber removal efficiency is 99+%, with an estimated "

An alarm of 4 ppm or greater at any of these 5 leak detectors will activate the scrubber. They will also trigger red, flashing alarm beacons, audible alarms (local and over the plant intercom system), and control room alarms to warn other personnel. Leak detectors will be calibrated for a range of 0-30 ppm, with digital\n\nchlorine level readout locally, outside of the room, and in the control room. The chlorine scrubber will be maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chlorine release event.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42 (i.e. deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies. The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95. The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nSignificant modifications to the plant system are not anticipated to be undertaken in the next few years. Ideas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present "

Though not all recommendations may have been implemented, all were considered. The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n\n"
