Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently.\nThrough oral reviews, written tests, and on-the-job demonstration, we ensure that our employees understand the training given to them.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Callaway-Smyrna plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe"

Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Callaway-Smyrna plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict design standards for process equipment.

We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care..  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. \nWe have implemented maintenance and inspection programs that ensure site integrity.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  Examples of controls to prevent releases include (1) installation of pressure relief valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, (2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, (3) using materials of construction that are compatible with the process chemistry, (4) vessel pressure and temperature are continuously monitored and (5) use of carbon and water scrubbers to remove small amounts of emissions.\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, fire suppression systems in areas where flammable chemicals are present and fire fighting equipment in all process areas, a fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate PPE and an alarm system for early notification of a release.

We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  Following is a brief description of the facility and a list of RMP-regulated processes at our facility.\nThe Callaway-Smyrna plant is situated on 60 acres.  Covered processes are the phosphorous acid process and the  ammonia process.  RMP covered chemicals currently include phosphorous trichloride and aqua ammonia.  Maximum quantities of these chemicals include about 264,000 pounds of phosphorous trichloride and 90,000 pounds of aqua ammonia.  Both processes are subject to Program Level 3.\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of offsite consequence analysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards.  The alternative release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.\nFollowing are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit exposure distances.\nWorst-case toxic release scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the toxic substances handled by Callaway-Smyrna"

Approximately 175,000  people live within this distance from the tank.  Some of the public and environmental receptors that are located within this distance are as follows:  Nickajack Creek, the Chattahoochee River, Lindley Middle School,I-20 and Six Flags, I-285 and numerous businesses and houses.\n\nAlternative toxic release scenarios\nThe alternative release scenario for phosphorus trichloride is a break in the hose used for unloading phosphorus trichloride from a tank truck into our process.  The liquid is pumped to the ground at a flow rate of 440 lb/min for 2 min, which is the length of time required for a Callaway employee to shut the pump off.  The phosphorus trichloride evaporates from the liquid pool and travels about 0.20 miles  before dispersing below the toxic endpoint.

A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are resolved by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years or whenever a significant change is made.   The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.
