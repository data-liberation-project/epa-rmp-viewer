If an emergency were to occur, Chesapeake EHS personnel on call will notify the local fire department and request they respond to the emergency.  The Texas Railroad Commission will also be notified.  Chesapeake will also engage contractors to remedy and cleanup as needed in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nA Description of Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nThe inlet gas stream flow through the pipeline where it is routed to the compressor engines to be scrubbed and compressed. The water scrubbed off the gas is routed to the water tanks. The compressed gas is routed to the filter separator then to the glycol dehydrator where the wet gas is converted to dry gas. Any water off of the glycol dehydrator is routed to the water tanks. The dry gas is routed to the gas refrigeration unit where it is chilled and converted to natural gas liguid (NGL). The NGL is stored in bullet tanks (Pressurized tank) prior to transportation by truck. There is a flare at the facility that is used to control tank emissions and compressor blowdowns. Dry gas from the refrigeration unit is sold as fuel via pipeline. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario:\r\nThere are 3 pressurized storage tanks right next to each other.  Each 18,000 gal nominal storage capacity.   All three NGL storage tanks release is considered a worst case.  Used RMP Comp to calculate the worst Case Calculations.  Each regulated component in NGL had 0.3 mile of 1 psi overpressure distance. Flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion was used as worst case for this facility as the distance came out to 0.5 miles.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nNo NGL accidental release incidents recorded at this facility that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage."
