      "SummaryText": "1.0    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CERTIFICATION\n\n\n\n1.1    SITE INFORMATION\n\nThe main operation of Delta Battleground Distribution Center is contract chemical warehousing and distribution.  The facility was completed and began operation in June 2004.  The facility is situated on a 5.1347 acre tract of land located at 1251 Clay Court in Deer Park, Texas 77536.\n\n\n\n1.2    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is Delta's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances. Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\n\n\n\n1.3     THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Delta Battleground Distribution Center facility's primary activity is the warehousing chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta Battleground Distribution Center receives the regulated substances in 55-gallon drums for storage.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. \n\n\n\nChemical                    CAS No.\n\nToxic Substances:    \n\nEthylenediamine             107-15-3\n\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate    584-84-9\n\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate    91-08-7\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4    THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115 and therefore is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  Delta Battleground Distribution Center is a Program 2 level facility.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternativ"

RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenarios for the toxic chemicals involve the dropping of a pallet containing four drums and release of their entire content inside the warehouse (est. 220 gallons at 104?F based on historical temperature records).  The alternative release scenario involves the puncture of a drum and release of its entire contents inside the warehouse (est. 55 gallons at 104?F).\n\n\n\nNone of these scenarios is likely to result in the actual loss of all the regulated substances from the vessel because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst case and alternative case scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\n\n\n\nThe Toluene Diisocyanate is kept on site as a mixture of both Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (80%) and Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate (20%).  When calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, the chemical percentages are factored.  For example, a 55 gallon drum would contain 44 gallons of Toluene 2,4 Diisocyanate and 11 gallons of Toluene 2,6 Diisocyanate.\n\n\n\n1.5    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Delta Battleground Distribution Center is subject to EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\n\n\nProces"

The checklist and what if methods are used to carry out the process hazard analyses. The process hazard review is undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and is revised as needed when there is a change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Delta Battleground Distribution Center maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as normal operations, emergency operations.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the warehouse and distribution process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center has a training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. New employees receive training before starting work. Operating procedures are reviewed annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; fire suppression systems, vent systems and emergency shutdowns scenarios. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. These personnel receive specialized on the job training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are cor"

Process operators and maintenance personnel whose job tasks are affected by a change or modification of process conditions are made aware of the changes. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications in existing processes are conducted as needed. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment in operation.  Attachment C provides the Pre-startup Safety Reviews Form.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center conducts compliance audits to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions as a result of the audits will be undertaken promptly. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from recurring. Reports are retained in the web based CMS system.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDelta Battleground Distribution Center believes that incident prevention is a team effort and involves employees in the incident prevention process. Delta employees have access to the information created as part of facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
