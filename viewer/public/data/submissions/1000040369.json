      "SummaryText": "Colorado Fuel Manufacturers, Inc.\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n=========================================================================================\r\n\r\nColorado Fuel Manufacturers, Inc. (CFMI) operates as a natural gas liquids fractionation plant, which processes natural gas liquids that are trucked into the facility by independent trucking firms.  The NGLs are unloaded into storage tanks prior to being processed.  Once the product is introduced into the fractionization system, certain chemicals, known as \"light ends\" are removed from the NGLs.  Those chemicals include ethane, used as plant fuel-gas, as well as propane and butane, which are sold commercially.  \r\n\r\nOnce the light ends are removed from the NGLs, the remaining liquid is termed natural gasoline.  The natural gasoline is a low octane fuel that is transported to a gasoline blending facility and used as a blend stock for producing no-lead gasoline.\r\n\r\nRisk to the public from the CFMI facility is extremely low, primarily due to the location of the plant.  The plant is situated approximately two miles from any family dwelling and about 5 miles from the nearest town. In the event of a release or a fire, the people most likely to be effected would be CFMI employees.  In the event of a large chemical release or fire, employees are trained to shutdown the plant if practical, notify other persons in the area (i.e. truck drivers, contract employees), and leave the plant to go to the predetermined rally point.  In the fall of 2002, personnel from the County's Designated Emergency Response Agency, the Grand Junction Fire Department, arrived to conduct a facility review.  The results were presented to the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  At the LEPC meeting, the DERA representative stated that in an emergency situation, he believed that the CFMI plant would not pose a threat to the community or the general public. The latest presentation to the LEPC occurred on June 12, 2007.\r\n\r\nCFMI employs excellent methods to m"

      "SummaryText": "inimize risk at its facility.  The CFMI facility uses a Leak Detection And Repair (LDAR) plan to conduct quarterly inspections of all potential leaking VOC sources. The inspection is conducted using a handheld flame-ionization detector which is capable of detecting leaks from 1 to 10,000+ parts-per-million.  Equipment tested includes all potential fugitive emission sources, such as tanks, pumps, valves, compressors, emergency relief valves and connectors. \r\n\r\nThere are over 1,300 points checked during a typical inspection.  When a leak is discovered, a work order is written up and the first attempt of repair usually occurs within 48 hours.   \r\n\r\nMonthly LDAR inspections are conducted on any known leaking sources and all pumps.\r\n\r\nLeaks at CFMI's facility are minimal.  The results from testing are reported to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, who administers the program for the EPA.\r\n\r\nAs part of the facilityA\u00bfs SPCC plan, in compliance with 40 CFR Part 112, a visual inspection of tanks, and other items, occurs monthly and annually. In addition to the SPCC requirements a weekly inspection also occurs.  The tank section of the inspection form requires observation for:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf\tSigns of leakage,\r\nA\u00bf\tSigns of corrosion,\r\nA\u00bf\tSeam damage,\r\nA\u00bf\tCondition of tank foundation, and,\r\nA\u00bf\tFlange leakage.\r\n\r\nAny problems that are discovered are quickly resolved.  \r\n\r\nNon-destructive testing has also been done on atmospheric tanks with the last inspection, conducted by a certified tank inspector, took place on May 29, 2013.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the possibility of accidents at our facility, all operations employees are trained on all operational procedures, including emergency procedures. \r\n\r\nCFMI has a commitment to safety.  This is demonstrated by an inspection conducted by the Occupational and Safety Section of Colorado State University.  Such an inspection is conducted only when requested by a small business (less than 150 employees) and when the business agrees t"

      "SummaryText": "o correct any \"imminent danger\" hazards without delay and \"serious hazards\" in a timely manner.  The business must provide a report of actions taken in regard to any hazard identified.  After inspecting the facility, the inspectors recommended that CFMI apply for the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARPs) award.  The inspectors stated that although only a few are awarded, CFMI was an excellent candidate for the award, which is recognized by OSHA.  OSHA does not inspect a SHARP's facility, unless a serious violation occurs.  Contained in the summary of the inspection is the following, \"CFMI is making every effort to provide a safe and healthy workplace.  Very few serous hazards were identified during our surveys.  The written programs we reviewed were excellent, as were the training records.\"  Also, \"Perhaps the most remarkable quality of CFMI's health and safety culture is their management commitment.\"\r\n\r\nSince the first inspection (detailed in the above paragraph) was conducted, CFMI requested another inspection.  The inspection took place in 2012 and again the CSU safety inspectors recommended CFMI to the SHARPS program.\r\n\r\nNo one is more concerned about the safety of the plant; its employees and the surrounding community than CFMI.  Our intention is to remain vigilant because of the hazardous nature of our business and do all that is possible to operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner."
