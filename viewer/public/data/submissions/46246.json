This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  BWC has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery\u00bfs primary process hazard analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation was performed using the \u00bfwhat if\u00bf and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nBWC updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every five years to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.  \n\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner.  The objective of the seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substances having off-site consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computeri"

The audits include an assessment of written prevention program elements, retained records (e.g., training records, completed hot work permits, etc.), and personnel interviews to assess level of implementation for the prevention program.\n\nCompliance reviews are performed by trained, expert personnel.  Audit results are communicated to affected employees and contractors, and retained for five years.  Action items or recommendations resulting from the various audits are tracked to completion through a computerized database.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\n\nThe BWC accident investigation program covers four types of incidents:\n\n* personal injury;\n* environmental release; \n* equipment damage and loss of production caused by fire, equipment failure or other circumstance; and\n* those incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic event.\n\nThe goal of an investigation is to determine the facts associated with a release or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team is directed by a team leader who has had training in incident investigation and root cause analysis. \n\nThe results of the investigation are communicated to all employees.  Corrective measures and action items resulting from an investigation are tracked to completion in a computerized database.  BWC maintains copies of incident investigation reports for a minimum of five years.\n\n4.10 Employee Participation\n\nAll BWC employees have the right to participate in the development and implementation of process safety management activities as stated in the Risk Management and Process Safety Management rules.

This procedure documents the date(s) authorized for hot work, identifies the equipment on which hot work is to be done, and assures that all personnel involved in permitting are trained on this procedure. \n\n4.12 Contractors\n\nContractors at BWC are selected based on their past safety performance, their current safety programs, and their conformance to the BWC Refinery Safety Rules and Regulations Manual.\n\nThe BWC Refinery Safety Rules and Regulations Manual provides contractor employees with safety information including entrance and exit procedures, safe work practices and work permitting procedures, emergency action plans, process safety information, and contractor injury/illness reporting.  \n\nBWC also requires annual plant orientation, which includes information on the emergency action plan, potential process hazards, and site safety rules.

The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\nDelayed coking operations are conducted in Area 3, whereas refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2 (EPA Facility ID 1000 0014 7815).  Those two areas are on contiguous properties and not adjacent to Area 3, therefore a separate RMP submittal has been prepared for them.\n\nThe purpose of the RMP program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \u00bfregulated substances\u00bf that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  \u00bfRegulated substances\u00bf are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA and BWC has quantities of various \u00bfregulated substances\u00bf above threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC Area 3\nSection 3: Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \nSection 1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various BWC units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.  Systems and procedures are in place to control changes in process technology, facilities, and operating and maintenance procedures in order to provide for continued safe and reliable operations.\n\nAll employees at BWC have the respons"

Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOff-site consequence analyses are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental releases.  The results of these analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nBWC conducted off-site consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA) RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidelines (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule has set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  These worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified \u00bfendpoint\u00bf.  In this case, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is used for flammable substances.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for a regulated flam"

These are more realistic than the worst-case scenario for assessing the potential hazards posed by BWC process units and developing emergency response plans.  Although they may be unlikely to occur, these ARSs are physically possible and reasonably feasible.  \n\nEPA OCAG procedures were not used for modeling the alternative release scenarios.  Because more flexibility is provided for in characterizing releases and assessing the impacts for the alternative release scenarios, the \u00bfPHASTProfessional\u00bf model by DNV Technica for the ARS was used.  PHASTProfessional is an advanced consequence modeling program that examines the progress of a potential incident from initial release through the formation of a cloud and/or liquid pool and on to final dispersion and flammable/toxic effects. \n\nA summary of the alternative release scenarios for BWC Area 3 is provided below.
