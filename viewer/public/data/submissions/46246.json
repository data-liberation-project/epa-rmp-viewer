Area 3\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for Area 3 of the Big West of California, LLC Bakersfield Refinery (BWC).  The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\nDelayed coking operations are conducted in Area 3, whereas refining operations are primarily conducted in Areas 1 and 2 (EPA Facility ID 1000 0014 7815).  Those two areas are on contiguous properties and not adjacent to Area 3, therefore a separate RMP submittal has been prepared for them.\n\nThe purpose of the RMP program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific ?regulated substances? that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment.  ?Regulated substances? are hazardous chemicals identified by EPA and BWC has quantities of various ?regulated substances? above threshold amounts.  \n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC Area 3\nSection 3: Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\nSection 4: BWC Accidental Release Prevention Program\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n \nSection 1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at BWC\n\nEquipment at the various BWC units must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.  Systems and procedures are in place to control changes in process technology, facilities, and operating and maintenance procedures in order to provide for continued safe and reliable operations.\n\nAll employees at BWC have the respons"

Overview of Regulated Substances at BWC - Area 3\n\nThe facility began operations as Mohawk Oil in 1932.  Under different owners, regular expansion and improvements of facilities occurred over the years.  Area 3 was purchased in 1987 by Texaco.  Then,  in 1998, the refinery became a part of Equilon Enterprises, LLC, a joint venture of Shell Oil Company and Texaco Inc.  Shell Oil Products US acquired Texaco's interest in 2002.  On March 16, 2005, Big West of California, LLC acquired full interest in the refinery.\n\nBelow is a summary listing the covered process units that are subject to the federal Risk Management Program, defining the appropriate RMP program level, and identifying the regulated substances handled in these units.\n\nSummary of Covered Process Units ? BWC Area 3\n\nUnit:  Delayed Coker Unit (Units 30 and 34)\nProcesses vacuum residuum, or the fraction of crude oil that did not vaporize in the Crude or Vacuum Units.  The vacuum residuum is heated and then thermally cracked in the Coke Drum.  The vapors are then discharged to a fractionator and separated into specific petroleum liquids.  The coke that remains in the Coke Drum is hydraulically removed, classified by size, de-watered, then transported off-site to buyers for use as fuel.\nProgram Level 3\nRegulated Toxic Substances:  None\nRegulated Flammable Substances:  Hydrogen, Ethylene, 1-Butene, Propylene, Isopentane, Pentane, Isobutane, But"

Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOff-site consequence analyses are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental releases.  The results of these analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\n\n3.1  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nBWC conducted off-site consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidelines (OCAG).  This methodology was used because the RMP rule has set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios.  These worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified ?endpoint?.  In this case, the endpoint for toxics substances is a specified concentration, and a specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is used for flammable substances.  \n\nThe worst-case scenario for a regulated flam"

These are more realistic than the worst-case scenario for assessing the potential hazards posed by BWC process units and developing emergency response plans.  Although they may be unlikely to occur, these ARSs are physically possible and reasonably feasible.  \n\nEPA OCAG procedures were not used for modeling the alternative release scenarios.  Because more flexibility is provided for in characterizing releases and assessing the impacts for the alternative release scenarios, the ?PHASTProfessional? model by DNV Technica for the ARS was used.  PHASTProfessional is an advanced consequence modeling program that examines the progress of a potential incident from initial release through the formation of a cloud and/or liquid pool and on to final dispersion and flammable/toxic effects. \n\nA summary of the alternative release scenarios for BWC Area 3 is provided below.

This information is kept current by management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are discussed further in this section.\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nBWC conducts process hazards analyses (PHAs) to ensure that hazards associated with process units are identified and controlled.  Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  BWC has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery?s primary process hazard analysis technique.  Some of the revalidation was performed using the ?what if? and risk matrix methodologies.  Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\nBWC updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every five years to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.  \n\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies.  The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes.  A site walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner.  The objective of the seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substances having off-site consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake.  The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computeri"
