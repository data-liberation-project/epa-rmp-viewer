Emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process. The overall emergency response program for Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant is shared and coordinated with San Juan County Emergency Management.  This coordination includes attending periodic meetings, which include local emergency response officials and industry representatives.  The Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant has 24-hour communications capability with the San Juan County Emergency Management. The plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the San Juan County Emergency Management and emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant plans to install additional engineering safeguards and continued learning and training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."

It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Kutz Gas Conditioning Plant processes raw natural gas into methane and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by gathering system pipelines.
