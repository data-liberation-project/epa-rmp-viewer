(SWAFC) to conduct its business operation in such a manner as to protect the safety and health of our employees, our customers, the public and the environment.\n\nThe safety and health of employees, customers, the public and the environment is of the highest priority to SWAFC.  We will implement programs which help to protect employees, customers, the public and the environment.  We will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and implement programs to help ensure compliance.\n\nWe will review all present and planned facilities, processes and products to ensure conformance with the applicable laws and regulations.  We will manufacture products that can be used, handled, stored, distributed and disposed safely with common safety practices and SWAFC safety and health information.\n\nThe site has an emergency response plan that outlines the established responsibilities in the event of an emergency. The plan identifies how the local authorities, including the fire department and local emergency planning commission (LEPC), will be notified in the event of an emergency that may have off-site consequences.\n\nThis facility manufactures, packages, and stores paints for the automotive market.  In addition, this facility manufactures the resin that is used as a raw material in the automotive paint manufacturing process.  The RMP-toxic substance, acrylonitrile, is used as a raw material in the resin process, and is stored on-site in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the toxic substance acrylonitrile was determined by EPA to be a liquid spill of the entire stored quantity.  The results were modeled using the EPA model, RMP Comp.  The scenario assumes that the total quantity of the toxic substance stored in a vessel is released into a containment area, and then evaporates.  The endpoint for the toxic substance acrylonitrile was determined by EPA to be 0.076 mg/L.\n\nThe modeling for"

      "SummaryText": " this facility assumed a release of 124,000 pounds of acrylonitrile from storage tank 27, and resulted in an endpoint of 0.6 miles.  However, these results are very conservative since EPA considers the instantaneous release of the total quantity of a toxic liquid substance in a vessel to be an unlikely event.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is considered to be more realistic.  The alternative case assumes that while unloading the acrylonitrile from the rail car to the storage tank, a gasket failure occurs at the flange on the pressure side of the pump.  This would result in the spraying of acrylonitrile into the diked area.  Since the unloading operation is monitored by employees, the maximum length of time that the spill will occur before the emergency shut-off is activated is 10 minutes.  This would result in a maximum release of 10 gallons of acrylonitrile spraying from the flange into a diked area.  Again the results were modeled using the EPA model, RMP Comp.  This scenario assumes the release of 66.4 lbs of acrylonitrile over a ten minute period resulting in a toxic endpoint of less than 0.1 mile.\n\nThe release hazards associated with handling acrylonitrile at this facility are associated with spills of the liquid material.  Numerous safety systems are in place to prevent the occurrence of a release.  Practices which are in place to minimize accidental releases include task specific training, work instructions, job safety analyses, industrial hygiene monitoring programs and administrative controls including use of personal protective equipment, spill containment areas and preventive maintenance schedules.\n\nA substance-specific Acrylonitrile Emergency Response Plan exists.  In addition to the above listed safeguards, the unloading and storage for this material is protected by its own fire suppression system; dedicated hard-piping; metered, top-unloading; and specific work instructions and job safety analysis.  Initial and annual refresher training is provided "

      "SummaryText": "to employees who work directly with unloading process or use the raw material in the manufacturing area.\n\nNo accidental releases of acrylonitrile have occurred at this location in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program is contained in the Richmond Emergency Contingency Plan which incorporates guidelines for an Integrated Contingency Plan or core plan.  It consists of an internal notification structure, regulatory compliance reporting requirements, emergency cooordinator responsibilities, equipments lists, incident-specific control and response actions, evacuation plan, employee training, arrangements with local authorities and disaster recovery plans.\n\nThe site continually reviews and if necessary improves the safety programs and systems at the facility. For example, the containment area around the acrylonitrile storage vessel has been extended to 7 feet in height, providing containment solely for the entire contents of the tank in the event of tank rupture.\n\nThe SWAFC has also included within this submittal an analysis of its stand alone warehouse distribution facility located on-site.  The warehouse facility stores and distributes finished paint products produced at the SWAFC as well as finished aerosol products that are produced elsewhere and shipped to this warehouse prior to redistribution.  Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e. propellants) are the RMP flammable substances stored in the finished aerosol containers stored on-site.  The Sherwin-Williams Company is submitting information regarding the storage of aerosol containers within this warehouse for compliance purposes only, and this filing shall not be construed as an agreement by Sherwin-Williams that this portion of the facility is covered by the rule.

This scenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage vessel (an aerosol container) is released into a vapor cloud, which then explodes.  The endpoint for the impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud.\n\nThe modeling for the warehouse assumed a release from the largest aerosol container which has 300 grams of a flammable mixture (i.e., propellant). This resulted in an endpoint of 0.007 miles (37 feet). This would not have an off-site impact. These results are very conservative.  EPA's own guidance indicates that EPA considers not only the release of the total quantity of a flammable substance in a vessel into a vapor cloud to be highly unlikely, but also the explosion of a vapor cloud to be an unlikely event.  Further, the guidance states that the endpoint of 1 pound per square inch is intended to be conservative and protective, and does not define a level at which severe injuries of death would be commonly expected.\n\nThere has not been an accident or incident that has met the RMP criteria involving propane, butane, isobutane or methyl ether at the facility during the last five years.  Criteria for RMP reporting are accidents that have resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  The warehouse has never had a release that caused off-site injury in its entire history.\n\nThe warehouse portion of the SWAFC along with the plant site maintains trained responders to handle a variety of emergencies at the site including incipient fires and chemical spills. The warehouse works closely with the SWAFC plant to assure that arrangements for assistance from the local fire department and emergency responders have been coordinated to respond to incidents of a larger scale"
