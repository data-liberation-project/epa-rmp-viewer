The total square footage of this combined facility is approximately 400,000. Total of on site Anhydrous Ammonia is 44,000 pounds.BGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse has not had a reportable release of Anhydrous Ammonia.\nThe main hazard associated with Anhydrous Ammonia at this site is the release of the entire system into the atmosphere. Because of the Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs (OSHA Mandated - Updated Annually) that are in place and praticed at this facility a release of this nature would be unlikely. A catastrophic event such as earthquake or tornado however could cause such a release.\nThe entire facility is behind an eight foot security fence with authorized personnel access only to and from premises. The entire facility is guarded by armed security personnel 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nBGC Persihable/Frozen Foods Warehouse Anhydrous Ammonia maintenance personnel have over 35 years experience working with Anhydrous Ammonia. Maintenance employees responsible for the Ammonia system are trained every six months in donning and doffing emergency reponse equipment such as SCBA, Ammonia Respirators, Level A Suits, and other required PPE.\nBGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse maintains close ties with the LEPC, Tyler Fire Department, and Hazmat Team. Annual tours are conducted to maintain familiarity with the facility. The Tyler Fire Department and Hazmat Team have both recognized the experience that BGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse personnel have with respect to Anhydrous Ammonia response and have requested that the Hazmat Team backu"

      "SummaryText": "p BGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse personnel in the event of an ammonia release.\nAll on site partners are trained in emergency evacuation annually. All new partners are trained in emergency evacuation and ammonia awareness during the new partner orientation process.\nBGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse Anhydrous Ammonia system has been engineeered to code. The engine room is enclosed and vented to the atmosphere. All piping is vented to the roof so that a release can escape to the outside. An \"Emergency Anhydrous Control Box\" is located outside the facility that would allow the entire system to be shut down manually in the event of a major release.\nBGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse has implemented and continues to conduct a preventative maintenance program to ensure that any and all hazards are addressed to reduce the risk of an Anhydrous Ammonia release.\nIn the event of a suspected release of Anhydrous Ammonia BGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse have a Pollution Crisis Management and Emergency Response Contingency Plan in place. This plan is updated annually or whenever deemed necessary by Management or the Environmental Health and Safety Coordinator. The plan was developed to protect our partners and community. BGC Perishable/Frozen Foods Warehouse, Supervision, Security, LEPC and the Tyler Hazmat Team all have copies of the Emergency Response Contingency Plan. This plan consists of an emergency notification call down list containing the 24 hour contact numbers for all trained responders, the duties for Ammonia Specialist/Responders, contact information for the LEPC, SERC, NRC, TCEQ, and a MSDS for Anhydrous Ammonia."
