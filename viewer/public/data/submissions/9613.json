If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, law enforcement personnel and other authorities to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nII.\tFacility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored is 80,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.  This amount, however, is in storage for only a few days in a year\u0012s duration.  This tank remains empty for eight months of the year and the inventory is kept as low as possible for he four months of activity.  Only the two owners are involved in receiving and dispensing ammonia.  Employees are prohibited from these activities.\n\n\nIII.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 0.83 miles.\n\n\tB.\tThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .0.22 miles.\n\n\nIV.\tRelease Prevention Program\n\n\tMaintaining equipment properly, as explained in the Hazard Review, Section 68.50, and reviewing and following correct operating procedures as outlined in rule Section 68.52 are important to our release prevention program.  \n\n\tNo employees are involved in the transfer of ammonia at this facility.\n\n\nV.\tThe Fi"

      "SummaryText": "ve-year Accident history\n\n\tWe have had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\n\nVI.\tThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\tThe emergency response program at our facility involves two volunteer fire departments, the local police department, the county sheriff department and the local state highway patrol.  We have coordinated efforts with each of these agencies and are assured of their cooperation and assistance in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  All three law enforcement agencies routinely check this facility when they are in this area.\n\n\tThere are thirty-five homes located within our end-point of 0.83 miles.  These residents are being sent information regarding the hazards of ammonia and treatment procedures for ammonia exposure as well as being enlisted to notify authorities and the facility contact person in the event they suspect an ammonia release.\n\n\tIn the past our insurance company provided one of their loss-control agents to inspect our ammonia equipment and to conduct a training session for the two fire departments who would assist in the even of an accidental ammonia release.  This training will be repeated in July.  Also, one of the fire departments has scheduled their own training session at this ammonia facility for later this month.\n\n\nVII.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\tSince the anhydrous ammonia we handle has such potential for harm we are always alert for weaknesses in our equipment and our methods of handling the anhydrous ammonia.  At this time we have no additional specific ammonia safety recommendations."
