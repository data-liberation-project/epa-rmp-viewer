We have had no accidental releases involving chlorine during the past five years.  If an accidental release occurs, we are prepared to conduct a formal accident investigation to identify and correct the root cause of such an event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n6.0\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nOur employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  Instead, our facility is included in the community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), and we maintain an emergency action plan that is coordinated with the Excelsior Springs Fire Department for emergency response actions.  Our action plan provides the essential notification for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We coordinate our action plan with the Clay County LEPC, the community emergency response plan, and the City of Excelsior Springs Fire Department\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at our facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n\r\n1.\tReplacement of, and preventative maintenance on, the chlorine feed equipment, including the chlorinators, injectors, rotometers, regulators, and feed tubing."
