Since the last resubmission in June 2004, none of the threshold quantities, distances-to-endpoint, or affected populations has changed.  However, three RMP chemicals (formaldehyde, oleum, nitric acid) have been removed from use at the site, and therefore have been removed from the RMPlan.  This reduces the number of covered chemicals on-site from thirteen (13) to ten (10).\n\n\nI.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEastman Chemical CompanyA?s Tennessee Operations accidental release and emergency response policies are summarized in our company A?Principals of SafetyA? Document:\n\nA?Eastman will conduct all aspects of its business in a manner that provides for the safety of employees, contractors, communities, customers, and the environment.A?\n\nOur safety process consists of 5 main steps:\n\n&#61656;    Hazard identification, prevention and control\n&#61656;    Safe design and construction\n&#61656;    Safety and health education and training\n&#61656;    Employee involvement, accountability, and responsibility\n&#61656;    Systematic evaluation for continual improvement\n\nDetails of our accident prevention efforts are contained in the Eastman (Kingsport Site) Safe Practices Manual, a 350-page document detailing specific practices and procedures to ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\n\nTennessee OperationA?s emergency response efforts are contained in the Eastman Kingsport Site Emergency Plan.  This plan specifies the responsibilities and duties of Eastman personnel during emergencies and potential emergencies.  These responsibilities and duties provide for the prompt mobilization of the CompanyA?s resources, including both personnel and equipment in an emergency situation.  \n\nThese plans are updated continually, and reviewed"
