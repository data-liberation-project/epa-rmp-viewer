Long term exposure to low concentrations or short-term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health effects by inhalation.  Although the substance is not itself flammable, it is a strong oxidizer that may ignite combustible organic materials upon contact. \n\nUses\nPhosphorus trichloride is used as a raw material to create products used primarily in the plastic additive and agricultural chemical market.\n\n6.\tAcetaldehyde\n\nBasic Information\nAcetaldehyde is a clear colorless liquid with a pungent odor.  However, under normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, liquid acetaldehyde will rapidly evaporate into a gas.  Its vapors are irritating to the mucous membranes and especially the eyes.  If it becomes contaminated, it may either react with the contaminant or polymerize both with the evolution of heat.  It is lighter than water and soluble in water.  Its vapors are heavier than air.\n\nUses\nAcetaldehyde is a base ingredient used to produce other chemicals.  It eventually ends up in many products containing fibers and plastics.\n\n7.\tIsobutylene\n\nBasic Information\nIsobutylene is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor. It is shipped as a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure.  Contact with the liquid can cause frostbite.  It is easily ignited.  Its vapors are heavier than air and a flame can flash back to the source of leak very easily.  The leak can either be a liquid or vapor leak.  Vapor is irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat.  If inhaled, it can cause dizziness or loss of consciousness.  The liquid can cause frostbite.\n\nUses\nIsobutylene is used as a feed stock for manufacture of photographic intermediates.\n\n8.\tEthyl Ether\n\nBasic Information\nEthyl Ether is a clear colorless liquid with a characteristic anesthetic odor.  It is lighter than water and soluble in water.  Its vapors are heavier than air.  The vapor is irritating to the eyes, nose, throat, and skin.  If"

Since the last resubmission in June 2004, none of the threshold quantities, distances-to-endpoint, or affected populations has changed.  However, three RMP chemicals (formaldehyde, oleum, nitric acid) have been removed from use at the site, and therefore have been removed from the RMPlan.  This reduces the number of covered chemicals on-site from thirteen (13) to ten (10).\n\n\nI.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEastman Chemical Company\u00c2\u00bfs Tennessee Operations accidental release and emergency response policies are summarized in our company \u00c2\u00bfPrincipals of Safety\u00c2\u00bf Document:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfEastman will conduct all aspects of its business in a manner that provides for the safety of employees, contractors, communities, customers, and the environment.\u00c2\u00bf\n\nOur safety process consists of 5 main steps:\n\n&#61656;\tHazard identification, prevention and control\n&#61656;\tSafe design and construction\n&#61656;\tSafety and health education and training\n&#61656;\tEmployee involvement, accountability, and responsibility\n&#61656;\tSystematic evaluation for continual improvement\n\nDetails of our accident prevention efforts are contained in the Eastman (Kingsport Site) Safe Practices Manual, a 350-page document detailing specific practices and procedures to ensure the safety of our employees, our contractors, our community, and the environment.\n\nTennessee Operation\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response efforts are contained in the Eastman Kingsport Site Emergency Plan.
