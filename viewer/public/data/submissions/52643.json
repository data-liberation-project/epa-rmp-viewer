      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WEST UNION PLANT\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nDominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion), - West Union plant is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  The commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program covering areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and employee training associated with the facility processes.  Appropriate controls to prevent possible releases are continually implemented. If a release does occur, employees control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Doddridge County emergency response (911) will be utilized for emergency response capability. Dominion has contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an Oil Spill response organization to provide additional emergency response expertise. \n\nOne operator typically staffs the facility during one shift each day.  The Dominion Hasting compressor station located nearby, remotely monitors the operation of the West Union Extraction Plant continuously.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nDominion owns and operates the West Union Plant located in Doddridge County, West Virginia.  The facility is a cryogenic turbo-expander plant that straddles a gas transmission line, owned by Equitrans.  The West Union Plant receives inlet gas at where it is scrubbed to remove free liquids in the gas, compressed and dehydrated utilizing two molecular sieve beds.  After dehydration, the gas is cooled then  fractionated where liquids condense and fall to the bottom and the overhead gas is removed from the facility by pipeline.  The mixed NGL product (approximately 50% propane, 35% butane, and 15% C5+) is sent to the product storage tanks.\n\nThe West Union Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Dominion identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n\nThe listed flammable substance stored above"

      "SummaryText": " its threshold quantity at the West Union Plant is NGL which is considered to be a flammable mixture.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the West Union Plant is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the West Union Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe results of the analysis for the worst-case flammable release is provided in the RMP.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nThe results of the analysis for the alternative-case flammable release is provided in the RMP\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe West Union Plant does not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a list of management system documents detailing the accident prevention program in place at the West Union Plant.  Because the processes at  the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nDocument copies are available upon request.

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n \nThe prevention program activities help prevent potential accident release scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  The facility has safety features to prevent safe operating limit compromise.  In the event a release does occur automation detects the release at points and perimeters and initiates a shut down to a safe state.  Fire suppression is addressed through eliminating the fuel source via automation, hand operated valves, and fire extinguishers.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe West Union Plant has experienced no accidental releases over the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nThe West Union Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies and evacuation if a release occurs."
