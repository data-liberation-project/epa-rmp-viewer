If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizer. There are two tanks at this facility. The maximum quanity stored in the 12,000 gallon tank would be 52530 lbs. with the tank filled at 85 percent full. The other tank is a 6000 gallon tank. The maximum quanity stored in it would be 26,265 lbs with the tank filled to 85 percent capacity. The total quanity stored on site is 79,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst-case release scenairo would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity stored in the 12,000 gallon tank would be 52530 pounds which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.63 miles.  The alternative release scenario based on the five year accdient history or most likely potential accident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of disperision to 200 PPM) is . 83 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ANSI K-61 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111. We have also complied with the EPA, DOT and the Kansas Department of Agriculture who inspects our facilities on an annual basis. These standards and regulations along with the safety culture and training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safet record.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuat"
