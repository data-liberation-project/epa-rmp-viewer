      "SummaryText": "a.  The Merck Stonewall accidental release prevention policy is a unified approach, integrating technology, procedures, and management practices.  The Merck Stonewall emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to each covered chemical at the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community and is in complete compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.  Merck & Co., Inc. is a worldwide research-intensive health products company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human and animal health products.  Merck?s Stonewall Plant, located near Elkton, Virginia, was established in 1941.  Currently, the plant employs approximately 950 people in a range of pharmaceutical manufacturing activities such as fermentation, solvent extraction, organic chemical synthesis, and finishing and packaging operations.  The facility?s products include broad spectrum antibiotics, an antifungal, anti-parasitic drugs for human and animal health, a cholesterol lowering drug and medicines for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Parkinson?s disease.  The production of the two latter products require the use of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is charged to process vessels from railcars.  \n\nc.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as ?worst case release? and ?alternative scenario.?  The worst case release is defined by EPA, which states that ?the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel....is released as a gas over 10 minutes? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.?  Worst case release and alternate scenario modeling was performed for the toxic gas, hydrogen chloride.\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed utilizing EPA RMP*COMP, Version 1.07, to determ"

      "SummaryText": "ine the distance traveled by the chemical released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by EPA as the Emergency Response Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effect or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\n\nOne worst case scenario for toxic materials was developed for the Merck Stonewall facility.  The worst case release scenario for anhydrous hydrogen chloride involves the failure of one full railcar.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed based on the EPA pre-defined conditions, namely release of the entire amount of material in ten minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with the radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 meters per seconds, and air temperature of 77 degrees F (25 degrees C) were used.\n\nOne alternative release scenario for toxic gas was developed.  The scenario involves failure of a one-inch hose full of liquid anhydrous hydrogen chloride during unloading operations causing a release from the railcar and the liquid residual material in the transfer piping.  With the opening to the atmosphere, the contents of the hose, the transfer piping, and the railcar will release through the hose at a rate just under the set point of the excess flow valve.  The highest set point on the excess flow valves is 15,000 pounds per hour.  The release is assumed to remai"

EPA suggested meteorological conditions were utilized, namely Stability D, wind speed of 3 meters per second, and air temperature of 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).\n\nd.  The Stonewall accidental release prevention program is based on the following process safety management key elements including:\n\nAggressive and thorough Hazard Analysis (Hazop) performed on all processes.\nProcess Specific and Safety Training for operators.\nUse of best industry practice for safe handling of highly toxic and hazardous materials.\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures.\nImplementation of both a corporate and local audit program.\nPreventive and predictive maintenance program.\nFully trained and active site emergency response team.\nContractor Safety program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include the presence of hydrogen chloride detectors and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous hydrogen chloride.\n\ne.  No accidental releases of anhydrous hydrogen chloride meeting the definition of 40 CFR 68.42 have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.  The facility has an emergency response program, including an on site emergency response team, fire brigade, and emergency medical services team.  The program has been coordinated with the Rockingham County Fire and Rescue Department, which is a member of the LEPC.  This program includes emergency response guidelines and procedures for each covered chemical and a notification plan.  Emergency response drill evaluations are conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\n\ng.  Recent upgrades to the HCl system were completed on November 25, 2002.  The upgrade included welded piping and valves, new/upgraded instrumentation, surveillance monitoring, additional mitigation control and automation controls to improve the reliability of the system.
