The BMS-Syracuse facility comprises 84 acres and is bordered by residential, commercial, and industrial properties.  Over 70 buildings are located at the site, providing facilities for two divisions of the company:  Technical Operations and Pharmaceutical Research Institute (PRI).  The Technical Operations facilities consist of pharmaceutical manufacturing, quality control, chemical and biological development laboratories, pilot plants, and administrative offices.  Pharmaceutical manufacturing activities include fermentation, chemical extraction, chemical synthesis, and bulk operations.  The manufacturing operations produce primarily intermediate bulk antibiotics and other pharmaceutical compounds which are shipped outside the facility for final processing to finished product forms.  PRI facilities consist primarily of research laboratories and administrative offices.\n     The primary NAICS code for facility operations is \"325411:  Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing\".  Specific operations which occur at the Thompson Road facility that are classified under this NAICS code include:  (1) antibiotics:  bulk, uncompounded and (2) chemicals, medical:  organic and inorganic - bulk, uncompounded.\n     BMS utilizes two chemicals at the Thompson Roa"

Anhydrous ammonia is maintained in one bulk storage tank at a working capacity of 22,050 pounds (the storage tank is located in a dedicated building).  Dimethyldichlorosilane is maintained in one bulk storage tank at a working capacity of 80,314 pounds (this vessel is located in a dedicated building).  The use of both anhydrous ammonia and DDS at the Syracuse facility are summarized below.\n     Anhydrous ammonia is utilized in both fermentation and hydrolysis operations.  Fermentation uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control.  The Fermentation pH control system consists of a probe in each tank to measure the pH, a computer control system, a solenoid valve on the ammonia line to each tank, and associated piping.   When the pH drops below the predetermined value, the solenoid valve is energized (opening for a short time) and ammonia flows into the tank with the air supply.   In addition, the hydrolysis plant uses anhydrous ammonia for pH control during hydrolysis.  Setpoints for pH control, hydrolysis time, and ammonia use are entered into the analog output control prior to hydrolysis.  During hydrolysis, two pH probes in each hydrolyzer are monitored continuously.  Total ammonia use and minimum hydrolysis time are also monitored during hydrolysis.\n     Dimethyldichlorosilane is utilized in the manufacture of an antibiotic product.  Within the manufacturing process, DDS is combined with solvents and the pharmaceutical precusor to form a \"protected\" intermediate.  During the course of the reaction, the DDS is totally consumed by the reaction.  The batch operation is controlled automatically via computer.\n     The BMS-Syracuse facility operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week.  In May 1999, Bristol-Myers Squibb employed approximately 850 full-time personnel at the Thompson Road facility.  Access to the site is restricted by both fencing and security per"

The planning distances and potential impacts of these release scenarios are discussed below.\n     For the anhydrous ammonia worst-case release scenario, BMS has assumed a release of the entire contents of the bulk storage tank (working capacity maintained at 5,000 gallons) over a period of ten minutes.  In the calculation of the release rate, BMS has accounted for the fact that the storage tank is maintained in a building (utilizing the release rate calculation methodology established in the USEPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" document).  The planning distance for such a release has been estimated at 2,060 feet (release would leave facility boundaries; process would be categorized as a Program Level 3 activity).  This planning distance has been estimated by air dispersion modeling, utilizing the Inpuff model (with urban coefficients).  This release event would have the potential to impact population receptors.  BMS has a number of mitigation controls in place which would reduce the probability or minimize the impacts of such an event (these measures are described in the section entitled, \"General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Systems\", below).\n     For the alternate release scenario, BMS has assumed that the anhydrous ammonia delivery hose would develop a significant leak during bulk unloading.  For the scenario, BMS has assumed a 30-minute response time to isolate the leak (e.g., don personnel protective equipment and actuate valving at both the truck and tank).  The planning distance for such a release has been estimated at 187 feet (this distance has been estimated by air dispersion modeling, utilizing the Inpuff model (with urban coefficien"

BMS has a number of mitigation controls in place which would reduce the probability or minimize the impacts of such an event (these measures are described in the section entitled, \"General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Systems\", below).\n     For the dimethyldichlorosilane worst case release scenario, BMS has assumed a release of the entire contents of the bulk storage tank over a period of ten minutes.  In calculation of the release rate, BMS has accounted for the fact that the storage tank is maintained in a building (utilizing the release rate calculation methodology established in the USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" document).  The planning distance for such a release has been estimated at 53 feet (release would not leave facility boundaries; process would be categorized as a Program Level 1 activity).  This planning distance has been estimated by air dispersion modeling, utilizing the Inpuff model (with urban coefficients).  As this release event would not leave the facility boundaries, offsite population/environmental impacts are not predicted.

Level II Incidents are any spill incident that can only be controlled utilizing the resources of the plant Emergency Response Team (i.e., the use of chemical protective gear and equipment), require the evacuation of employees beyond the immediate vicinity, and/or require reporting to any outside agency.
