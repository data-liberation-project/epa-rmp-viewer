We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\n\nDreyer?s Grand Ice Cream is located in 5743 E. Smithway St, Commerce, California.  We manufacture some of the finest ice cream in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization tank.  The facility produces and ships approximately 30 million gallons of finished product each year.\n\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains just shy of 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nDreyer?s Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, avoid property damage and disruption to production.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents and evaluate incidents of near misses, because they focus on the rule"

Several things are demanded as a condition of employment in a Dreyer?s work environment; the most important of which is safety.  In recent years significant resources have been deployed against company-wide safety objectives. \n\nDreyer?s maintains a comprehensive risk and safety program.  These systems include: injury & illness prevention, control of hazardous energy, confined space entry, line breaking, hot work, and emergency response.  These written programs provide the foundation for employee education, training, and ongoing safety process execution and improvement.\n\nA zero tolerance for safety incidents is enforced at Dreyer?s.  Each safety incident is documented, investigated, and reviewed.  In addition, any corrective action necessary to prevent recurrence is implemented in an expedient and comprehensive manner.\n\nFurthermore, a zero tolerance policy for any accidental releases of hazardous materials demands each incident be documented.  Fugitive emissions must be recorded and traced to the original source.  This means that when ammonia vapors are detected, the original source must be located and the problem corrected: valve packing, pump seal, flange gasket, etc.\n\nA rigorous preventative maintenance (PM) program is used to prevent accidents before they happen.  Dreyer?s utilizes a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to track and organize all PM activities.  Each week, a list of tasks is generated by the CMMS and is then divided amongst several qualified personnel for completion.\n\nIn addition to regular, ongoing preventative maintenance activities, annual events occur t"

This includes daily round checks, IIAR Mechanical Integrity Safety annual inspection and physical examinations of strategic pieces of equipment/pipelines.  These activities provide a foundation for formulation of an annual maintenance plan.\n\nDreyer?s Grand Ice Cream maintains on-site emergency response teams.  At Commerce, this team is comprised of approximately 11 members from different work teams, shifts, and locations throughout the facility.  All members receive training on a regular basis including topics such as first aid, CPR, triage, SCBA use and hazardous materials response.  Each member has been trained as an emergency responder to (at a minimum) the Hazardous Materials Technician level.  In addition, approximately one-half of the team is also qualified to the Incident Commander level.  These roles are practiced during team and plant-wide emergency response drills staged periodically throughout each year.\n\nAll emergency response activities are carried out in accordance with the Emergency Response Business Plan.  This plan details items such as evacuation procedures, roles & responsibilities, notification procedures, emergency response equipment, hazardous materials inventories, and media inquiry response.  Dreyer?s also maintains an emergency response command center strategically located on the property.  This command center houses SCBA?s site maps, refrigeration P&ID?s, first aid equipment, mitigation devices, communications equipment, and decontamination equipment.  The general emergency response philosophy of Dreyer?s Grand Ice Cream is that all actions are intended to be defensive in nature therefore the primary concern of all emergency responders is the safety of employees, the public,  and any threat to the environment.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Engineer and Emergency Response Fa"

If outside assistance is needed the local fire department/HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Dreyer?s Grand Ice Cream Emergency Response Team is contacted.

Outstanding incidents are addressed monthly and are all followed to a documented conclusion.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Dreyer?s Grand Ice Cream facility incorporates a standard evaporation and Compression Style Ammonia Refrigeration system.  Ammonia vapor from the Intercooler is routed to the suction inlet of the High Stage Compressors.  \n\nAt the High Stage Compressors, ammonia vapor is compressed to a super heated vapor.  The super heated vapor is fed to the Evaporative Condensers.  At the Condensers the super heated vapor rejects heat and converts to high pressure Condensed Liquid Drain.  The condenser accomplishes this by using a combination of air and water flow across ammonia coils.  The condensers are equipped with safety relief valves that relieve around the isolation valves.  Airflow is supplied to the condensers via fans internal to each condenser.\n\nWater from the Condenser Water Sump is pumped via the Condenser Pumps to the Evaporative Condensers.  At the Condenser the water is forced through spray nozzles over the ammonia coils.  Water is collected at the bottom of the Condenser in a sump pan where it gravity drains back to the Condens"

The Condenser Water Sump is also equipped with a chemical treatment for the control of contaminants in the water system. The Condensed Liquid Drain from the Evaporative Condensers gravity drains to the Thermosyphon Vessel.\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid gravity drains from the Thermosyphon Vessels to Thermosyphon Supply Headers which supply liquid to the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers of the High Stage and the Low Stage Compressors.  At the Thermosyphon Oil Coolers on the Compressors the High Pressure Liquid absorbs heat from the oil pumped through the Compressor.  As it absorbs heat it changes from a liquid to a Liquid/Vapor Combination.  This Liquid Vapor Combination is returned from the Thermosyphon Oil Cooler on each Compressor to the Thermosyphon Return Header where it returns to the Thermosyphon Vessel.  In the Thermosyphon Vessel the liquid and vapor is separated.  The liquid being recirculated back out to the Compressors.  The Vapor is fed to the Evaporative Condensers, where it is re-condensed and returned to the Thermosyphon Vessels.  \n\nAs liquid accumulates in the Thermosyphon Vessels it will gravity drain into the Receiver where it is stored. As Ammonia Liquid is needed in the system, it is fed from the Receiver through Liquid Filters to several Evaporators and as Liquid Makeup to several vessels.\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is fed to the Purger.
