Process 2 (Engine Room 1)Distance to Toxic Endpoint was determined as 1.2 miles.  Process 1 WCS envelops all public receptors that were involved with Process 2 WCS.  As such the RMPlan for Omaha includes only one reported WCS, that of Process 1.\n\n\n\n       Alternative Release: The Alternative Release scenario of Process 2 (Engine Room 1) Has public receptors, Good Samaritan, Oak Ride Apartments, UA Local Union 669.

Had no Accidental Ammonia or Chemical Release that would cause a change in the RMP from 12/23/2011 to 12/16/2016. Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, is defined as an extremely hazardous substance per 40 CFR 355.20. \n\n\n\nIn response to the release, the plant was evacuated and the fire department was called for support.  Plant refrigeration and fire department personnel isolated the leak.  Two facility employees were given more than first aid; there were no other recordable injuries involved.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nA SCBA-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site. This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q). The team will implement control measures (both confinement operations and containment operations) required to remediate other than a major incident.  In the case of a major incident / release, the Omaha Fire Department would act as the Repsonders; Tyson's facility team would implement their Emergency Action plan.\n\n\n\nA written Emergency Action Plan has been developed and is on record at the Facility.
