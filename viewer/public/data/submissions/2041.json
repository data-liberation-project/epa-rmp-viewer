Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care ..\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has one process, the Cypan . production unit, that involves a regulated substance, acrylonitrile.  Cypan is uses as a lubricant in oil and gas drilling.\n\n(c) WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario is the failure of a storage tank and the release of 130,000 pounds of acrylonitrile.  The effect of written operating procedures and a high level alarm/interlock to the unloading pump that prevents the storage tank from being filled to more than 95% of its capacity and a dike were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is a flange leak on an unloading pipeline and the release of 1,072 pounds of material.  The mitigating effect of a dike, a deluge system and an emergency shutdown system were included in the evaluation of the possible consequences.  The evaporating acrylonitrile could reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\n(d) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n- EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Ha"

Eliminated bottom connections.\n7 An improved mechanical integrity inspection program for tanks, vessels and piping used to process acrylonitrile.\n \n(e) 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no incidents in the last five (5) years of plant operation according to the EPA incident reporting criteria.  In addition, the Woodbridge plant in its nearly fifty years of operations with acrylonitrile has never had an incident that would meet the EPA reporting criteria.\n\n(f) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Woodbridge plant emergency response program includes the following:\n\n7 A written Emergency Response Plan which is reviewed and updated on a regular basis and distributed to community emergency response officials and emergency medical services.\n7 An emergency shutdown switch and fixed foam vapor suppression system with several remote activation stations\n7 Emergency training for all site employees\n7 A plant incident response team, trained to respond to accidental acrylonitrile releases.  Arrangements for spill cleanup with environmental contractors.\n7 Emergency response drills and critiques to improve performance with the Woodbridge Fire Department, Woodbridge Township Office of Emergency Management, Middlesex County Ha"
