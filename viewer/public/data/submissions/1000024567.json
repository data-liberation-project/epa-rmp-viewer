      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\n\n\n\nThe Desert Star Energy Center (facility) is located approximately 15 miles southwest of Boulder City, Nevada. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) Revision and Update is for a change in status of the facility from a Program 1 to Program 2 in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 Section 190 (?68.190). In accordance with ?68.190(b)(7), this update has been prepared within six months of a change that altered the Program level applied to the aqueous ammonia system. The change in Program level is due to a new public receptor that will be located within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case\n\nrelease scenario. The Desert Star Energy Center, formerly El Dorado Energy, LLC., is separating from the solar power generation portion of the facility (Copper Mountain Solar)and changing its name. This change was final on October 1, 2011. The most recent RMP update for the facility occurred in September 2009. The plan was\n\noriginally submitted to the Administering Agency, the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) in September 1999. A log of the RMP revisions is\n\nprovided in section 3 of this plan.\n\nThe federal RMP regulations require periodic updating of the RMP program information, but do not require that the entire plan be recreated in its entirety. In fact, the RMP regulations require that many of the program documents be retained for the life of the plan. The RMP is expected to change and evolve as the facility changes, as new information on chemical hazards is developed, as the affected system is modified, and as the surrounding community changes. In some instances, new program elements supersede previous versions; in other cases, the new program element supplements the previous version. To ease the administrative burden for the facility, the previous version of the RMP is incorporated by reference into this RMP update. Pursuant to the regulations outlined in the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter"

      "SummaryText": " 459.9542, the Clean Air Act Section 112(r), and 40 CFR 68, this RMP has been prepared and submitted by the Desert Star Energy Center. This program is implemented under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) of the Bureau of Waste Management (BWM) NDEP.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling process at the facility was identified as the only process that triggers the RMP/CAPP requirements. This process is covered under the federal RMP Program 2 and CAPP Tier B, Program Level I requirements, based on the storage of 15,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight. There have been no changes to the facility or regulated process since the date of the original RMP submittal that would affect the RMP program level for this facility. \n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response:\n\n\n\nThe Desert Star Energy Center has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner. To help ensure the safety of its employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment, The Desert Star Energy Center has implemented a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency action planning programs. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material, and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to employees, the public, and the environment. The Desert Star Energy Center management is committed to providing appropriate training to employees and coordinating action activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers to\n\nensure a safe operation.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description:\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant changes to the facility since the original RMP was developed in 1999. The facility is an electric generating station consisting of one 175 megawatt (MW)steam turbine and two 165 MW combustion turbine generators capable of generating 480 MW of "

      "SummaryText": "electricity. The two 165 MW turbines burn pipeline quality sweet dry natural gas exclusively and are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems for the control of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The SCRs employ ammonia injection technology that reduces NOx to the targeted level of 3.5 parts per million volume (ppmv) at 15 percent oxygen (O2). The ammonia source for the SCRs is aqueous ammonia with an ammonia concentration of 28 percent by weight. Figure 1 provides a general facility layout showing the location of the ammonia storage and handling system.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant changes to the ammonia storage and handling system since the development of the original RMP. The ammonia storage and handling system at the facility is comprised of a single storage tank, pumps, piping, and a vaporizer. Following the vaporizer, there are two blowers (one for each SCR) that deliver the vaporized ammonia stream to the SCRs. The tank is a horizontally-oriented cylindrical tank, rounded on each end. The tank is constructed of carbon steel which is compatible with aqueous ammonia. The tank has a total capacity of 16,400 gallons and is equipped with pressure relief valves, a flame arrestor, and temperature, pressure and level indicators. The maximum capacity of the tank is administratively limited to 15,000 gallons. The tank is installed within a concrete secondary containment structure. The containment structure has a surface area of 1,124 square feet (53.5 feet by 21 feet) and a wall height of 3.5 feet. The total containment capacity is 29,415 gallons. The piping from the tank to the vaporizer is also carbon steel, 1 to 2 inches in diameter, depending on the service. Photographs of the tank, containment structure, vaporizer and blowers are provided in Appendix I.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility has onsite spill prevention and control procedures, including daily visual i"

The following provides a summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nDischarge Detection by Personnel:\n\n\n\nThe facility operators perform a visual inspection of the facility during each shift. During the inspection, deficiencies are noted on a checklist and corrections are initiated either immediately or a work request is generated depending on the nature of the problem. Records of the inspection checklist are kept in the Control Building.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Automatic Detection:\n\n\n\nAutomatic ammonia vapor electronic warning sensors are installed on the ammonia storage tank and skids. All sensors are connected to the control room. If ammonia fumes are detected an alarm will annunciate. Should an alarm be triggered, the procedures outlined in the Desert Star Energy Center Policies and Procedures Manual Section 8.02 - Emergency Action Plan, Subsection 3.5 Hazardous Materials Release will be initiated as appropriate. Once an initial assessment is made, the appropriate action of either shutting down the piece of equipment or initiating a clean up of discharged material should be performed. Based on this assessment, minor releases within the facility will be immediately contained and cleaned with either absorbent material or rags or additional clean-up personnel and\n\nequipment may be dispatched to the site and deployed to control and contain the spill. Clean-up equipment and material will be used in the manner most effective for rapid and complete clean-up of all spilled product. Spill cleanup material is located throughout the facility for this purpose.\n\n\n\nAmmonia Loading/Unloading Procedures:\n\n\n\nIn order to assist in the prevention of an accidental release of ammonia, the Desert Star Energy Center implements a standard operating procedure (SOP) for ammonia loading and unloading procedures.
