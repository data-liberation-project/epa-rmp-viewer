Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures and training.\n\nB.  Texon L.P. operates a propane transfer terminal in Albuquerque, NM.  Propane is received by rail car and is distributed by truck.  Ther are four 30,000-gallon rail cars and three 30,000-gallon storage tanks at the site, holding approximately 110,000 pounds each of liquid propane.  There are emergency shutdown systems on all LPG equipment at the site.\n\nC.  The offsite consequence analysis considers a worst-case scenario and an alternative scenario involving a propane release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The RMP Rule states that the explosion endpoint is 1psi overpressure.\n\nThe worst-case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of one of the 30,000-gallon rail cars or storage tanks holding approximately 110,000 pounds of liquid propane.  It assumes all of the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation is considered.  The explosion endpoint was identified as 0.4 miles (per RMP Comp Ver.1.07).  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial, residential, recreation areas, and a school.  Texon has multiple safeguards in place, which make this scenario very unlikely, including an aggressive maintenance and inspection program.\n\nThe alternative scenario involves a propane release from a Multi-port 2.5-inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 pounds per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation considered in this scenario.  A total of 4,315 pounds of propane is ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  A search of public receptors within this radius identified commercial properties.\n\nD.

The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire department and the Bernalillo LEPC.  The Bernalillo County Fire Department has participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\nE. The Albuquerque terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR 1910.120), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This propane transfer system was designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Texon L.P.) instructions.\n\nF.  To date, this facility has never had an incident involving propane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in-place."
