This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The Buttonwillow Warehouse Company's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Buttonwillow Warehouse Company - Site 1700 facility maintains and operates a process system comprised of anhydrous ammonia, as well as ammonium polyphosphate production.  The covered process is the equipment and piping associated with the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage, Transfer and Reactor Station located at 715 Yoder Blvd, Corcoran, CA.  The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia for this facility is approximately 108,768 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in the ammonia storage tank and also in the ammonia bobtail trailers.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the RMP Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the wo"

In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous ammonia release.  The facility has excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, adequate personal protective equipment and shower sources, and trained personnel.  \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAs part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) \r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nOperating Procedures (OP)\r\nTraining (TRN)\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\r\nCompliance Audits (CA)\r\nIncident Investigation (II)\r\nEmployee Participation (EP)\r\nHot Work Permit (HWP)\r\nContractors (CON)\r\nEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \r\n\r\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\r\nThe use of flammable materials at the Buttonwillow Warehouse Company- Corcoran Yard is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.
