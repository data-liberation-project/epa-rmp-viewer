The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.  To save lives.\n2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.  To protect the environment.\n4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nSysco maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nSysco has operated its ammonia refrigeration system since 1990. The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 250 Wieboldt Dr. in Des Plaines, Illinois  60016.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 12,000 pounds of ammonia for the storage of various food products. An additional supply of 900 pounds of ammonia in 150 pound cylinders are stored on-site to replenish the refrigeration system as necessary.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nSTEPS\n\nThe Sysco facility was built in 1972 and was designed and constructed in accordance with ammon"

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine room roof.   The engine room is provided with continuous ventilation and all equipment are monitored for temperature and pressure 24 hours a day.  The facility is secured and guarded at all times.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the low temperature pump receiver - 11,000 pounds - in 10 minutes.  No passive mitigation measures were used.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 m/s and F stability.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A 0.25 inch diameter leak of high pressure liquid ammonia for one hour.  The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 7600 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 m/s and D stability.  The EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables were used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no reportable accident history at this facility from June 1994 through June 1999.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSysco maintains a safety co"

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the Sysco Maintenance Supervisor (if he is present).  He will then use a portable radio to inform the Facility Manager and other managers and contractors of the situation. The Sysco Facility Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem.  Emergency agencies will also be notified as neccessary as outlined in the Emergency Repsonse Plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Sysco facility.  The recommendations will be implemented by June 1, 2000.\n\nR-01:  Install stop buttons at all three entrances/exits of the engine room.\n\nR-02:  Install a manual fan switch to activate in the event that sensors in engine room fail.\n\nR-03:  Once automatic shut down system is installed, consider tying in solenoid valve on highemperature pump receiver.\n\nR-04:  Label king valves and inform fire department of their location. \n\nR-05:  Establish appropriate emergency response and evacuation procedures for ALL employees.\n\nR-06:  Add a strobe light to the alarm system and relocate the alarm horn so that it may be heard by more employees.\n\nR-07:  The alarm horn currently sounds on compressor failure and detection of ammonia.  Reconfigure alarm system so that horn sounds on ammonia detection only. \n\nR-08:  In order to avoid"

Also, one of the following requirements should be fulfilled:\n\n    A. E.mployees must work in pairs while on the roof \n\n    B. Employees working alone on the roof  must notify another employee (not on the roof) of their whereabouts and the expected duration of the activity.\n\n    C.  Employees working alone on the roof should carry a two-way radio to communicate with another employee not on the roof.\n\nR-18:  Install barricades in non-entrance doorways of the mezzanine level of the engine room to prevent operators from falling.  Post warning notices on the doors notifying operators of the hazard present.\n\nR-19:  Remove any unecessary materials from the mezzanine level of the engine room, as it should not be used as a storage area."
