Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\n\nWawona Frozen Foods operates a commercial freezer for various fruit and vegetable products in Fresno, CA. The facility has ammonia refrigeration systems that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\n(1) Blast Tunnel\n\n(1) Hallway/Loading Dock\n\n(1) IQF Freezer\n\n(3) Refrigerated Rooms\n\n(1) Precooler\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is located at 2202 S. Cedar Ave., Fresno, CA 93725. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.718939, -119.755716. The facility is located approximately 1 mile northeast of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by industrial facilities and civilian housing.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Wawona Frozen Foods has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Processes\n\n\n\nSelect refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators, as required for flooded operation, while other areas are equipped only with air-cooling evaporators, as required for pumped overfeed operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof or adjacent to recirculators to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained wit"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Wawona Frozen Foods facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\n\n \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has no qualified 5-year accident history.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response "

When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wawona Frozen Foods has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Wawona Frozen Foods now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Wawona Frozen Foods employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Wawona Frozen Foods will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
