      "SummaryText": "Dairy Farmers of America\nZumbrota, MN\n\nProcess:\nThis facility is a food processing plant that runs a continuous operation. The regulated substance under the RMP ruling is Ahydrous Ammonia which is used in the refrigeration system. This is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas.\n\nThe RMP at this facility involves development of a written emergency response plan, coordination with the Emergency Response Commission and the Zumbrota Fire Department. A written PSM has been developed and employees trained in operating procedures. Safety procedures for contractors have been developed for work done on DFA property.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario assumes that the entire charge of ammonia is lost from the system.Given the assumption of a 10 minute release, generally flat terrain, wind speed of 3.4 mph and relatively stable atmospheric conditions, the RMP Comp model predicted a downwind distance of 2.5 miles to the ERPG2 of 200 ppm. Such a release is highly unlikely unless a tornado were to demolish the ammonia system. The Alternative Scenario is more reasonable. It assumes that a 0.75 inch pipe breaks and that the release is interrupted by closing the King Valve after 20 minutes. Based on the RMP Comp model, the downwind distance to the ERPG2 is 0.1 miles.\n\nDFA, Zumbrota is implementing this RMP to assure that the ammonia system is operated safely and efficiently. In implementing the PSM program, DFA has established written operating procedures and maintenance procedures to maintain the ammonia system. Also DFA has outlined a training program to train employees from awareness to hazmat responders and trained refrigeration operators."
