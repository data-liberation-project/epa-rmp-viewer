      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that all facilities (both public and private) which utilize specific hazardous chemicals above defined threshold quantities in their processes, be in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) 40 CFR 112r Part 68.  The Clifton Water District (CWD) utilizes liquefied chlorine in the treatment of water for use by the public.  Chlorine is on the list of hazardous chemicals covered by the threshold limits within the CAA.  The requirements presented in the CAA regarding processes that utilize hazardous chemicals identify specific safety precautions regarding handling and storage of the listed hazardous chemicals.  The Clifton Water District has specific release prevention and emergency response procedures in place to help prevent chemical exposure to water treatment personnel as well as the general public, given the life, health and safety hazards associated with liquefied chlorine.  It is the policy of the Clifton Water District to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules, regulations, and safety precautions.\n\n\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District's Board of Directors and Management that the emergency action response plan utilized by the Clifton Water District is in compliance with OSHA's Employee Emergency and Fire Prevention Plan, 29 CFR Part 1910.38.  The emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Team (HAZMAT) to respond to hazardous chemical releases at the water treatment plant, and to notify all potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Activities\n\n\n\nThe Clifton Water District provides domestic potable water to approximately 35,000 customers located in the unincorporated portion of Mesa County, generally referred to as `Clifton' (roughly the area encompassed from I-70 to the C"

The water treatment plant, along with the main business office is located at 510 34 Road, Clifton, CO.  The Clifton Water District processes water from the Colorado River through conventional water treatment practices as well as additional finish water treatment through a process utilizing membrane technology.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered in one-ton bulk containers by certified chemical transportation companies to the water treatment plant where it is off-loaded into the detached chlorine storage/feed facility.  The chlorine storage/feed facility is enclosed within a hardened `post-treatment' chemical structure.  This structure contains individual rooms for container storage, chlorinator feed systems, and the scrubber unit.  All rooms are separated by fire walls and are fire sprinkled.  The chlorine is fed to the treated water as a part of the final disinfection process prior to delivery to the end user.  The feed system utilizes two one-ton containers that are automatically switched from empty to full via the vacuum manifold system.  The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by the treatment plant's secure SCADA system.  In the event of a leak, the SCADA system automatically shuts down the chlorine feed system, activates the scrubber, and notifies personnel, either via the onsite alarm system or the off-normal hour auto dialer.\n\n\n\nAccess to the water treatment plant facility is controlled via locked automatic gates and security fencing surrounding the facility.  The post-treatment chemical feed structure is locked and alarmed at all times to prevent unauthorized access.  All treatment plant personnel are thoroughly trained regarding the hazards and risks associated with chlorine for both themselves and the general public.  Specific regulatory operational and maintenance procedures are in place "

The original water treatment plant was constructed in 1979 to all applicable codes and building requirements in force at that time.  The plant underwent expansion in 1981 and again in 1997.  Each time the plant was expanded, all applicable codes and requirements were followed and recommended chlorine handling modifications were implemented.  In 1999, the District identified the need for a revamped chlorine handling and feed facility.  This new facility was placed in service in December 2004.  Final project acceptance was completed in May 2005.  The new system equipment and components related to receiving, feed process and final discharge of chlorine are inspected daily by trained plant personnel and maintained and serviced according to equipment manufacturer's recommendations.  The water treatment personnel have been trained to follow specific operational and maintenance procedures while utilizing the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel perform daily checks and inspections of the chlorine handling/storage/feed system.  The facility has a complete and thorough maintenance schedule system in place.  This system is current with the facility components installed as a part of the facility.

The system is on a routine monitoring regimen by treatment plant personnel as well as continuous monitoring by the treatment plant's secure SCADA system.  In the event of a leak, the SCADA system automatically shuts down the chlorine feed system, activates the scrubber, and notifies personnel, either via the onsite alarm system or the off-normal hour auto dialer.  Specific activity procedures are in place for off-normal hour emergency notifications.  In January 2010, the District received notice that the chlorine container valve configurations were required to be changed from the western version to the eastern version.  This conversion was completed by June 15, 2010.  The District participates in a chlorine system external audit program that includes the City of Grand Junction Water Department.  The audit identifies operational and procedural areas that require updates and tracks completion of those requried updates.  This external audit was last performed in December 2010 and is scheduled to take place again in December 2015.  In October 2007, the District's chlorine system and maintenance and training procedures were inspected by staff from EPA Region 8.  The inspection found no compliance deficiencies.  \n\n \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nThe Clifton Water District had a release incident of between 16 and 26 pounds of chlorine during a container change out in October 2013.  The incident release occurred due to operator error as the feed piping was removed from the 'empty' ton container prior to confirming complete closure of the automatic valve controller.  Additionally, the employee had failed to secure the exterior doors to the chlorine room thus disabling the automatic scrubber system allowing the small amount of chlorine gas to vent to approximately 100 feet from the building well wit"

The local DERA responded not as an emergency response but rather as a training response to verify the empty container was in fact closed prior to transport.  The incident was reported to the National Spill Response Hotline, appropriate Colorado State Agencies, local response entities, and the Mesa County LEPC.  As a result of the employee error, all staff that deal with chlorine underwent refresher training, procedures were reviewed and updated as required, incident investigation and findings were presented and shared with the Mesa County LEPC and with local fire and emergency response agencies.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIt is the opinion of the Clifton Water District's Board of Directors and Management that the Clifton Water District's emergency response plan is currently in compliance with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention rule and all applicable State of Colorado Codes and regulations.  The response plan is supported by the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Clifton Fire District, and the Grand Junction Fire Department's HAZMAT Team.  The Clifton Fire District and the Grand Junction Fire Department's HAZMAT Team have toured the water treatment plant and are prepared for and are ready to respond to releases at this facility.
