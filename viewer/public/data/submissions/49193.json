FACILITY POLICY\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF THE PLYMELL FERTILIZER PLANT, GARDEN CITY CO-OP, INC. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n    THIS SITE IS MANNED PART-TIME  BY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FROM OUR LOWE FACILITY  DURING  FERTILIZER SEASON.  THE   PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE THE FACILITY IS  THE STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TO BE SOLD TO FARMERS FOR CROP PRODUCTION.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 190,000 # IN TWO TANKS, ONE A 26,000 GALLON TANK AND THE OTHER AN 18,000 GALLON TANK.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE CONTENTS OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 110,000 #, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200PPM) IS 2.20 MILES.\n     B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.83 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\" PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1919.111, \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".\n\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDEN"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n     THE FACILITY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.38, HAS PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA), AND HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD, 29 CFR 1910.120, INCLUDING PRE-EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\n     SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.  THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION AT THIS TIME."
