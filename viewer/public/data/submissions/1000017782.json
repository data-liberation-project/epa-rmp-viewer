This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and maintenance of our processes.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the stationary source and regulated substances.  The Kinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant, located near Snyder, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce CO2 and natural gas streams for sale or use.  The CO2 Plant has several regulated flammables, such as methane, ethane, and propane in concentrations greater than 1% in the natural gas.  Propane is also held in storage for refrigeration processes.  The CO2 Plant also uses or processes anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, however, these substances do not exceed the threshold quantities.\n\nHazard assessment results.  The worst case scenario associated with a release of flammable material is in Program 1 at the CO2 Extraction plant and is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest process containing natural gas.  The total amount of natural gas released is 240,282 lbs.  The maximum distance to the 1- psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.5 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nGeneral accident release prevention program/chemical specific prevention steps. The Kinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Kinder Morgan also provides a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes and chemical handling instructions.\n\nFive year accident history.  Kinder Morgan CO2 Extraction Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the last five years.  There has been no death"

      "SummaryText": "s or injuries reported on or offsite since June 21, 1994.\n\nWe investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.  \n\nEmergency response program, Kinder Morgan works very closely with the local emergency response authorities to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The overall emergency response program for the CO2 Extraction Plant is coordinated with the Snyder Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The coordination includes periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials.  The CO2 Extraction Plant has 24/7 communication with the appropriate LEPC official and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an accident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  Kinder Morgan resolves all findings from incidents occurring at the gas plant.  If incidents occur, Kinder Morgan will evaluate all possible methods to reduce or eliminate the risk of any occurring in the future.  This could involve decreasing process chemicals inventories, changing operational procedures, and newly revising detection systems, adding or modifying equipment, or increasing training requirements."
