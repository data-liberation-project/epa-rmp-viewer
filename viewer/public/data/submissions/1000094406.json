The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\r\n\r\nHigh Pressure Receivers\r\nThe purpose of the high pressure receivers is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condenser and supply high pressure liquid to each recirculator and liquid injection cooling to the screw compressor. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. High Pressure Receiver 1 is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nHigh Temperature Recirculators\r\nThe purpose of the high temperature recirculators is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in high temperature evaporators throughout the facility. The high temperature recirculators receive liquid from High Pressure Receiver 1 and supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the ammonia pumps mounted underneath the supplying vessel. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the recirculators to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each high stage compressor. The high temperature recirculators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the high temperature recirculators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Pumped Overfeed)"

      "SummaryText": "The purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the recirculators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the recirculators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condenser\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condenser is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia."

Audible/visual alarms are available inside and outside  the machinery room. If the concentration reaches 25 ppm, the emergency ventilation system will be activated. Once the ammonia concentration reaches 450 ppm, the compressors in the machinery room will be de-energized.\r\n\r\nRelief Valves\r\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\r\nEach relief valve has a set pressure equal to or less than the MAWP of the equipment that the relief valve protects;\r\nEach relief valve has a capacity which meets or exceeds the requirement of ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A \u00a715.3.8;\r\nAll relief valves terminate to the atmosphere, 7.25 ft above the roof;\r\nSelect relief valve assemblies are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90\u00ba swing.\r\n\r\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\r\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each screw compressor package:\r\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Suction Pressur"

The following list summarizes the safety devices built into each compressor package:\r\nHigh Discharge Pressure Cutout - The high discharge pressure cutout, will shut down the compressor if the discharge pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\nLow Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\r\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Float Switches\r\nThe liquid recirculators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n\r\nLevel Controller\r\nThe Liquid Recirculator 1 is equipped with a level controller to control the liquid ammonia level in the vessel. The level controller is equipped with high level, control level, and low level set points.\r\n\r\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\r\nThe High Pressure Receiver 1 is equipped with a sin"

      "SummaryText": "gle main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.\r\n\r\nEmergency Refrigeration Switch (E-Stop)\r\nThe principal entrance to the machinery room is equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch (e-stop) that controls power to the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room. The switch can be activated in an emergency using the hammer next to the switch to break the switch glass.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Blanc Vineyards Plant 2 facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked"
