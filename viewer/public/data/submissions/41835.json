      "SummaryText": "The Hy-Vee Perishables Center's approach to chemical safety is to prevent a release of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system that has a potential of causing harm to the public and the environment. This is accomplished through training, maintence of the systems, and by following company policies, as well as state and federal requirements. The Hy-Vee Perishables Center has chosen to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's 40 CFR Part 68 - Chemical Accident Prevention Rule to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia into the community. Additionally, senior management meets on a regular basis to review their commitment to safety, compliance, and implementation of safe procedures.\n\nThe Hy-Vee Perishables Center, located in Chariton, Iowa is a grocery products storage and distribution facility that contains refrigerated areas. The refrigerated areas are cooled by an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by the EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available. However, the properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community. In order to observe these safety precautions, Hy-Vee Perishables Center chose to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 14,000 pounds.\n\nIn addition to complying with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, applicable state codes and regulations are met to help prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators of the system are required to to complete a training and certification program to ope"

      "SummaryText": "rate the ammonia refrigeration system. Hy-Vee, Inc. also contracted Marsh Risk Consulting to perform audits of the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for the ammonia refrigeration system at the Hy-Vee Perishables Center. The purpose of the audits and audit report is to assist in complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\". Hy-Vee Perishables Center is required to comply with this regulation due to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a refrigeration system in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).\n\nThe Hy-Vee Perishables Center has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program has been established for the Hy-Vee Perishables Center. Elements of that program include, but are not limited to the following. Annual Emergency Responder training and certification of employees on the HAZMAT teams; emergency evacuation drills and mock release scenerios practiced annually; Emergency Response Program information shared with local fire department, hospital, law enforcement, and Lucas County LEPC; written procedures established for known and unknown ammonia leaks; contact lists of emergency response personnel.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety at the Hy-Vee Perishables Center include continued review of the PSM program and RMP, and addressing issues where applicable. Additional training is also planned for key individuals on the applications of managing the PSM program and RMP."
