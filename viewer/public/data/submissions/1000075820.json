Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Plant established a management system headed by the Water Quality Supervisor to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0  Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\n\nProgram Level: 3\n\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0  Hazard Assessment Results\n\n\n\nThe Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Pl"

The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the Greenville Water Witty Adkins Water Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.

This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.
