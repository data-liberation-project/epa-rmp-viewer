To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Specialty Chemicals Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2.Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant primarily makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes 1 (1) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, one (1)Urea-Formaldehyde/Phenol -Formaldehyde Resin Reactor, one (1) Urea-Formaldehyde/ Formaldehyde Resin Reactor.  Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for various types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.  The facility recently moved from tote storage of the Ammonia Solution to a storage tank.  \n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde                    1,300,000 lbs.\nAmmonia                               97,000 lbs.                                                                                                     .  \n "

A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\n\"Process stewards\" are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary,"
