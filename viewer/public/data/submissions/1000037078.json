      "SummaryText": "The Lloyd's Barbeque facility located in Mendota Heights, Minnesota is a meat further processing facility.  The primary purpose of this facility is to process beef, pork, and chicken into barbequed food products for distribution to retailers.  For this operation refrigeration of raw material and product is required.  To accomplish this, the plant has an ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is contained in this equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  Ammonia properties result in an efficient and effective refrigeration system while operating at reasonable pressures. Ammonia can be detected at low concentrations in the air providing an early warning for correction to potential maintenance tasks.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been in place at the facility since 2005 when the refrigeration system ammonia charge was increased to more than 10,000 pounds.  Periodically the plant is inspected by safety and industrial hygiene professionals.  Corporate Safety conducted an audit in 2013.  \n\n\n\nIt is our understanding that the facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes.

These changes resulted in upgrading approximately 80 to 90 % of the ammonia refrigeration equipment including piping, evaporators, high pressure receiver, low pressure recirculator and removing older equipment that was no longer needed for service.  The plant has a preventive maintenance program where We have replaced 3 of the compressors  in the last 5 years and vibration tests are performed every 6 months.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a training program.   This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  \n\n\n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \n\n-  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \n\n-  Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \n\n-  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \n\n-  A process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in September 2013.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The recommendations are being implemented on a time table.  \n\n-  Written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were prepared to prov"

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \n\n-  For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \n\n-  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \n\n-  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon Federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan has been in place for at least 10 years and includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Mendota Heights Fire Department and other agencies involved with response.  Mendota Heights Fire Department representatives visit this plant periodically with the most recent being in August 2013.  Another visit will be requested in 2014.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to respond to any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years that have resulted in death, injur"
