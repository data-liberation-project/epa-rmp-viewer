      "SummaryText": "Archaea operates a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) processing facility that generates RNG from recovered biogas emitted from an adjacent Landfill.  The Landfill naturally generates biogas which is fed into a cleanup and upgrading facility to create RNG.  The RNG is created by increasing the methane content by removing water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other impurities.  After upgrading, the RNG is compressed then it enters a commercial supply pipeline.  The RNG is also known as biomethane.  RNG is pipeline quality natural gas nearly identical to traditional natural gas and can be used for heating, cooking and other processes.  \nThe primary process safety hazards identified by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study include toxic gas exposure from H2S and overall flammable / explosive hazards from the methane within the system and the CNG trailers used.  The facility exceeds the PSM / RMP threshold quantity of methane due to the use of CNG from transportation trucks as a fuel source during the initial period of operations.  Worst case quantity assumed 2 full CNG trailers present within the unloading area.\nIn order to ensure safe operation of the process facility equipment, Archaea has a Process Safety and Risk Management program.  This program helps identify, and control process safety related hazards to personnel and the environment.  The process safety program includes the following main elements:\n\u0095 Employee Participation\n\u0095 Process Safety Information\n\u0095 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u0095 Operating Procedures\n\u0095 Training\n\u0095 Contractor Safety\n\u0095 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u0095 Mechanical Integrity\n\u0095 Hot Work Permit\n\u0095 Management of Change (MOC)\n\u0095 Incident Investigation\n\u0095 Emergency Response & Planning\n\u0095 Compliance Audits\nThe process safety management program is supplemented by an occupational safety program to help manage other safety and environmental hazards based on applicable regulations and codes.  A safety manual contains the policies, procedures and forms that"
