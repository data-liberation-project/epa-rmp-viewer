The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the impact to Tony Downs Foods employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be met by using good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Tony Downs Foods owned activities.\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe Tony Downs Foods facility is a poultry processing facility. Raw materials are trucked to the facility and then cooked into various products in canned, refrigerated or frozen form for retail and food service customers.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is used for cooling and freezing capabilities required for the processing and storing of the food product. The cooling medium for refrigeration at this site is anhydrous ammonia (subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68) consisting of 14662.5 lbs. which is used in a closed loop recirculating and recycling system.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n*\tEmployee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures all employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\r\n*\tProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.

The Plant Emergency Coordinator with cooperation from the Evacuation Coordinator and the Headcount Coordinator will evacuate all employees to the assigned evacuation area, perform a head count of everyone on-site, and wait further instructions from the Incident Commander for the Madelia Fire Department.  Upon site arrival, the Madelia Fire Department will assume Incident Command and will contact the Council Bluff's HAZMAT Team for assistance and designate individuals to proceed with off-site evacuation of the immediate facility and surrounding community(s) if necessary.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nTony Downs Foods completes a thorough review of the ammonia system each time a design change is implemented.
