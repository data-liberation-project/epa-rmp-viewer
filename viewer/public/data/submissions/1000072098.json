Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The emergency response plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCompliance with the environmental, health, and safety management systems forms the framework for continuous safety improvements. Specific actions will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety include, compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements, continue a relationship with the local fire department to ensure a state of readiness to   respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops, and continue to offer the Propane Emergencies training to all agencies involved."
