The process was evaluated using EPA assumptions within the RMP*Comp program.  The release is based on the possibility of the 6500 gallon bulk acid storage unit rupturing.  The release duration took place over a 10 minute period.   The release rate to air was calculated to 1.04 lbs/min.  The toxic endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.016mg/L and the resultant estimated toxic endpoint distance was 0.2 miles.  Heraeus Tenevo has several engineering and administrative controls in place to prevent the release of HF emissions and acid to the environment.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario\r\nThe scenario was determined by evaluating all process hazard information that has been gathered throughout the company's 29 year operating time period.  The RMP*Comp software was used to evaluate a release of 70% HF caused by a transfer hose failure during bulk acid trailer unloading.  The toxic endpoint was determined to be a concentration of .016mg/L at a toxic endpoint distance of 0.2 miles. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nTo prevent the release and ensure process reliability of Hydrofluoric Acid storage and handling processes at Heraeus Tenevo, several protective measure have been implemented within the manufacturing operation.  Heraeus has implemented engineering controls such air emission abatement equipment, level alarms and interlocked shutoffs to prevent overfilling of all tanks processing HF, all HF tank storage units are equipped with double walled tanks and secondary containment with leak detection/alarm systems, and all HF piping is designed with double walls with leak detection systems.\r\n   \r\nHeraeus Tenevo also has several administrative initiatives that will aid in preventing the release of HF to the environment.

To ensure that Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) handling and storage processes are operating at its most safe capabilities the processes are continually monitored both quantitatively and qualitatively.  HF storage and handling process also have been designed with redundant safety features to limit human error, limit exposure to HF during production and abate emissions from respective operations.  In accordance with Heraeus Tenevo RMP program, the processes are qualitatively evaluated with a What IF hazard analysis to determine potential exposures and respective controls to minimize probability for loss.\r\nIn the event of a disaster or release, Heraeus Tenevo has developed an Emergency Response Plan to respond to applicable situations, evacuation of the facility and contact procedures for emergency authorities. \r\n\r\nStationary Sources & Regulated Substances\r\nHeraeus Tenevo stores Hydrofluoric Acid at a 70% concentration.  This chemical is stored in a liquid state within a 6500 gallon tank unit.  The unit is not capable of storing the maximum volume due engineering and administrative controls that have been implemented by Heraeus Tenevo.

Heraeus coordinates with representatives from the Gwinnett County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit (Station 20), Technical Rescue Team (Station 24), and Station 14 in conducting mock emergency drills involving HF spills on at least an annual basis.  The drills involve Heraeus Spill Team members assuming a supporting role with First Responders in responding to a simulated emergency medical situation involving a significant Hydrofluoric Acid spill/exposure incident.  Post-exercise critiques are held to review response actions aimed at improving the overall group's effectiveness in handling future hazardous materials/emergency events.
