      "SummaryText": "Company History:\n\nMarChem Southeast designs and manufactures custom polyurethane and PVC formulations for a wide variety of industrial applications. MarChem Southeast does not produce any part, but rather supplies these formulations in a liquid state to end product fabricators. MarChem Southeast has a trained technical and quality control staff which develops all of our products, follows then through the manufacturing process and tests them for quality prior to shipment. This site has been in operation for more than thirty years. \n\nThe Covered Process:\n\nThe Delivery, Storage and Use of Toluene Diisocyanate to manufacture Urethane Binders\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is delivered to MSE via over the road tanker cars. Once at MSE, the tanker is unloaded into a storage tank with a maximum capacity of 7500 gallons. The TDI is then pumped into one of two batch units on site which are used to produce polyurethane pre-polymers or quasi pre-polymers. Each of these units has a capacity of 500 ? 6000 gallons. These pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting long chain polyols with Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in a 2:1 molar ratio to produce NCO terminated high viscosity pre-polymers. These pre-polymers can be chain extended by the end product fabricators with water, short chain polyols or diamines to produce molecular weight polymers. Quasi pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting only part of the long chain polyol with Toluene Diisocyanate which improves mixing, reduces volatility, improves compatibility, improves the mix ratio balance, reduces the exotherm and helps match viscosity differences.\n\nBoth batch units have hot oil jackets which control the temperature of the reaction. A MDA Scientific (Model TLD-1) monitor with a TDI keys is used to monitor the levels of TDI in the air. The monitor sounds an alarm if the atmospheric concentration of TDI exceeds 5 ppb. All MSE personnel who handle TDI, operate the covered process or perform quality control tests on TDI based material"

These badges are checked each shift that TDI is used to determine if any employee has been exposed to elevated levels of TDI.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nMarChem Southeast has not had an accidental release of Toluene Diisocyanate during the last five years.\n\n\n\n\nProgram Status (40 CFR ?68.10):\n\nMarChem Southeast has several public receptors within one tenth of a mile of the covered process and therefore does not fit the eligibility requirements of Program 1. The covered process is in NAICS code 325991 and is not subject to the requirements of the process safety management standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Therefore, the covered process falls under the Program 2 requirements of 49 CFR Subpart C.\n\nManagement System (40 CFR ?68.15):\n\nMarChem Southeast?s management system for the RMP for TDI is a team approach. The team consists of the Laboratory Manager, the Vice-President of Operations, The Maintenance Supervisor, and the individual Shift Supervisors. \n\nThe Laboratory Manager has the overall responsibility for the management of the RMP at MarChem Southeast. The Laboratory Manager is also responsible for the release scenarios, incident investigations and the RMP review and updates required under this RMP. The Laboratory Manager is assisted in his tasks by the VP Operations who is responsible for the hazard review, safety information, compliance audits and training program under this RMP and the initial submission of this RMP. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the maintenance program for the covered process. The Shift Supervisors who will handle emergency response functions when the Laboratory Manager is not onsite.\n\n\nPROGRAM 2 PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nSafety Information (40 CFR ? 68.48):\n\nThe Material Safety Data Sheet for Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) CAS # 26471-62-5 is located in this Risk Management Program binder. MSE has requested that the supplier send MSE updated MSDS as they become available.\n\nThe storage"

      "SummaryText": " tank for TDI at MSE is designed to hold 7500 gallons (76,350 lbs) at absolute capacity. Because of the usage pattern of TDI at MSE and the delivery schedule for TDI to MSE, the maximum amount of TDI in the storage tank at any one time will be 6000 gallons (61,000 lbs). The largest amount of TDI stored to date is 5900 gallons (60,000 lbs). \n\nChanges in the composition of the raw material (TDI), the equipment, the process or operating procedures or information received from suppliers or MSE?s own experience will be cause for an assessment as to the effect of the change on the RMP.\n\nHazard Review (40 CFR? 68.50)\n\nMarChem Southeast has utilized a ?What If? method to determine the hazards associated with the covered process and TDI itself. This method covered opportunities for equipment malfunction and human error that could lead to an accidental release. As part of this review, any problems identified in the ?What If? worksheets shall be resolved and the resolution documented in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures (40 CFR ? 68.520\n\nOperating procedures for the delivery, storage and use of Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) have been developed and are part of the Work Instructions (WI) in use at MarChem Southeast. \n\nTraining (40 CFR ? 68.54)\n\nEach operator of the covered process (or part of the covered process), personnel who will be involved in the maintenance of the process and the laboratory personnel who will be evaluating or testing TDI containing material will be trained in the safe use and handling of TDI and any emergency procedures in the case of a release.\n\nThis training will be done prior to any employee being assigned to the covered process or any part of the process. Refresher training will be given at least every three years. Whenever the process undergoes a major change, all affected employees will be trained in any new or updated procedures. \n\nMaintenance (40 CFR ? 68.56)\n\nThe equipment used in the covered process is part of the preventive maintenance (PM) p"
