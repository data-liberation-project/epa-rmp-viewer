This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nCIE has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite. These Plans also detail best management practices in place at the facility, i.e. good housekeeping, prompt routine equipment maintenance, and inspections.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe CIE ethanol plant is located in Marion, Grant County, Indiana. The facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel- and industrial-grade ethanol from grain. The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia: Anhydrous Ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an aboveground steel tank. The worst-case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, creating a vapor cloud. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint, 5.4 miles.

      "SummaryText": "nia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. The towns of Marion and Sweetser, Pipe Creek, Boots Creek, Cart Creek, Sims Franklin Ditch, Sweeters Ditch, Woods Ditch, Stoney Creek, Lomax Ditch, Lloyd Ditch are within the worst-case distance to the endpoint for ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment offsite. Denaturant is stored in an aboveground steel tank. The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. A worst-case SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint; the model result was a 0.7-mile radius. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenarios:\n\n1. Anhydrous Ammonia: The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release due to a ruptured disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system. This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite. The alternate release duration assumed is to be 30 minutes with atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec. The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minut"

      "SummaryText": "es. The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility and the excess flow valve has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation. RMP Comp was used to determine alternative scenario distance to endpoint; 0.3 miles. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2010 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternative release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n2. Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire. The endpoint used was an over-pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to the endpoint, the model result was a 0.1-mile radius. Population data was obtained using facility knowledge. Public receptor information (i.e. schools, hospitals) was obtained using Google Earth. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant. \n\n\n\nSince the facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Process Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nCIE's mainte"
