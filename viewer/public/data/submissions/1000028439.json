Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAt the NRG Indian River Power Generation Station, we utilize Ammonium Hydroxide that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a reactant in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems also necessitate certain safety precautions.  NRG strives to protect all of its valuable assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all of our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, Existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment.  It is our policy to comply with all Federal, State and Local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of Ammonium Hydroxide as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Dagsboro Fire Department and the Sussex County Emergency Management Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose for the regulated substance, Ammonium Hydroxide (29.4 percent ammonia solution) used at the Indian River Generation Station is to operate a Selective Catalytic Reaction (SCR) system as a component of the Air Quality Control System (AQCS) for Unit 4.  The maximum amount of Ammonium Hydroxide stored at this facility is 90,000 gallons or 674,072 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s) Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for each Reported Scenario.\n\n\n\nFacilities are not required to include a description of their worst-case and alternative release scenarios in the executive summary for their RMP.  Although section 68.15 of the RMP rule as originally drafted r"

Therefore, this requirement has been removed from the rule (69 FR 18819, April 2004).  This information can be found in other locations within the RMP documentation.\n\n\n\n4.     Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe process is new at the NRG Indian River facility.  There have not been any incurred reportable releases.\n\n\n\n5.    The Risk Management Program Management Structure\n\n\n\nThe management of the Risk Management Program will be handled by the Safety Specialist.  This NRG Indian River employee will administrate in conjunction with plant management and personnel.  Other entities or organizations that will be coordinated with include the Dagsboro Fire department and the Sussex County Emergency Planning Commission. \n\n\n\n6.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe NRG Indian River Generation Station complies with all applicable Federal, State and local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Plant personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications training and through access to our written programs.  Our Maintenance operators receive a combination of classroom and on the job training (OJT).  They are observed and are able to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Also, the ammonia system is operated, tested and maintained to stringent industry standards.\n\n\n\n7.    The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe NRG Indian River Generation Station has onsite hazardous materials trained personnel to respond in a defensive fashion.  These employees meet monthly and receive certification training and annual refresher training.  \n\n\n\nPla"

      "SummaryText": "nt personnel work closely with the Sussex County Emergency Planning Commission and the Dagsboro Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  This includes meeting periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility of any new concern.\n\n\n\n8.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCurrently, the NRG Indian River Generation Station trains and tests all maintenance technicians who will be working on the system.  The plant preventative maintenance program is above standard.  We have completed an aqueous ammonia unloading, storage and handling system HAZard and Operability study in March 2011.  Plant personnel have been implementing recommendations identified during that study through a process of continuous improvement.  NRG will regularly revisit the HAZOP and will revalidate every 5 years to ensure it is up to date.  NRG's overall safety program is improved continuously through annual updates of our written programs and annual training or our technicians.  NRG also takes advantage of new technologies when safer and more economical alternatives are available. \n\n\n\n9.    RMP e-Submit information\n\n\n\nThe following pages contain the information submitted by the NRG Indian River Generation Station to the EPA on September 19, 2011.  This information was submitted using RMP e-Submit. \n\n"
