This has improved BWC Time Room's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that BWC Time Room's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nBWC Time Room has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, BWC Time Room has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, BWC Time Room now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for BWC Time Room employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program BWC Time Room will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia storage process at the BWC Time Room facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 78,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.

The ammonia process operates as follows. Ammonia is supplied by a vendor into the ammonia storage tank. From there it is stored until a sale is made, at which time a BWC Time Room employee transfers ammonia from the storage tank into a smaller trailer-mounted nurse tank. The nurse tanks are towed by trucks off site for the fertilizer application.\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\n\nBWC Time Room is located 1 mile south of Herring Rd on Ashe Rd Bakersfield, CA. The latitude and longitude of the ammonia storage tank is 35.138369, -119.075704. The facility is located approximately 0.51 miles east of interstate highway 5 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is not located in a special flood hazard area.\nBWC Time Room is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that BWC Time Room had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Process Classification\n\nThe ammonia process at BWC Time Room consists of a single storage vessel.
