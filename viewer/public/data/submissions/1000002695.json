If the chlorine gas vacuum drops below a certain set point that has been pre-determined, the switch over system will switch from one bank to the other.  Once the chlorine gas is fed through the storage system in the scale room, it then enters into the chlorinator room.\n\nThe chlorine gas is then pulled through the five main chlorinators in the chlorination room.  The five units have the capability of feeding a total 4,000 pounds. Three of the units feed up to 1,000 pounds each and the other two can feed up to 500 pounds each per day. These five units provide chlorine for the post-chlorination system.  The chlorine is fed through injectors which are operated with plant water.  The chlorinators are used for various plant processes throughout the plant, and feed chlorine through four different chlorine injectors, which also uses plant water to operate.  Chlorine is provided to various points of the plant through these four injectors.\n\nThe chlorine scale room and the chlorine chlorinator room utilizes ventilation, leak detector and scrubbing systems for protection of the building and the plant.  The chlorine detector systems are Wallace and Tierman leak detection systems.  There is one of these in the scale room and in the storage room positioned to monitor the entire rooms. There is also a chlorine leak detector in the chlorinator room.  It is located at the southeast corner of the room. \n\nThe ventilation systems which are associated with the chlorine tank storage room are checked every 30 days for operational condition.  The louvers and vents are manually activated for verification of operation every time the lights are turned on before entering room. The leak detection systems are also checked, calibrated and verified for operation every thirty days.  The caustic scrubber unit is checked twice weekly."

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\t\t\n\n\n\tRisk Management Plan\n\tWest Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan for West Hickman Wastewater Treatment Plant has been prepared in accordance with EPA Risk Management program guidelines and is designed specifically for the West Hickman location. The West Hickman Waste Water Treatment Plant is located in Nicholasville, Kentucky, 3174 Ashgrove Pike and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Water Quality. The primary function of this facility is the treatment of wastewater, in doing so Chlorine is used for disinfection purposes and Sulfur Dioxide is used for the neutralization of chlorine in plant effluent. The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low to medium. The enclosed Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide building with alarmed detection systems will notify plant staff if a leak should occur. The air scrubber systems start automatically if a leak is detected.  These systems will greatly reduce the risk of a release from reaching the outside atmosphere.  In the event of a cylinder leak, the onsite personnel (LFUCG employees) would be immediately vulnerable to exposure.  In the event of a release, there may be possible human health impacts to on-site employees and the population in the surrounding area.  A worse case release could affect an area over 2.0 mile radius and impact a sizeable residential area.  The Lexington Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) Division of Water Quality has developed and implemented release prevention programs and emergency response plans to prevent and/or mitigate a release.\n\nThe LFUCG and personnel of West Hickman Wastewater Treatment Plant apply a proactive approach towards risk management.  The LFUCG has implemented a maintenance program, identifying management policies, preventive maintenance practices, plans and procedures to identify and minimize risk.  Preventive maintenance consists of daily and weekly checks of plant equipment."

A data sheet is printed out daily indicating the maintenance and check schedule of all equipment and procedures.\n\nThe LFUCG manages risk proactively by reduction, avoidance, and thorough communication with one another and the Local Emergency Planning Committees.  To date, no accidents or leaks have occurred at the West Hickman facility.  The possibility of a risk situation is reduced by conducting inspections and routine maintenance checks on a regular basis.  The LFUCG identifies, evaluates, and analyzes potential risk situations in order to minimize the potential of a hazardous event occurring at the plant.  Regular communications and emergency response practice with the LFUCG Fire Department ensures preparedness in the unlikely event that a leak should occur.\n\nIf a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak occurred, LFUCG Division of Water Quality employees and the LFUCG Fire Department are well prepared and trained to respond to the situation.  LFUCG employees are trained in handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  They are also trained on initial startup procedures, normal operating procedures, temporary operating procedures, emergency operating procedures, emergency shutdown procedures, normal shutdown procedures, and startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown procedure.\n\nResponse to a large chemical release at the West Hickman Wastewater Plant will include, but not be limited to the following agencies:  Lexington Fire Department, DEEM, Jessamine County LEPC, and Jessamine County Fire Department.

The risk analysis for both was modeled with EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables and Equations.  The results for this modeling is described below; however, it should be noted that the likelihood of leaks of this size and nature occurring are absolute worst scenarios and are not likely to occur.  \n\nThe West Hickman WWTP has made substantial investments to ensure the proper precautionary systems and equipment are installed to protect against leaks to the atmosphere.  These precautionary measures are best exemplified in the alternative release scenarios for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide and are described later in this report.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was modeled to determine offsite consequence analysis.  The EPA defines a worst-case release as the following:\n\n* The release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure, and\n\n* The release that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint for the regulated toxic substance.\n\nMitigation measures were not factored for the off-site consequence analysis for both scenarios.  Thus, the scenarios assume that full enclosure does not exist.\n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine at any given time is no more then 14 tons and no more then 12 tons for sulfur dioxide. The largest quantity of both chemicals was determined by taking into account administrative controls rather than absolute capacity of the pipes.  West Hickman uses administrative controls that limit the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that can be stored in a pipe at any one time.\n\nThe toxic worst-case release for chlorine via a pipe leak at West Hickman is 2,000 lbs with a release rate of 400 lbs/min.  The duration of the release is 10 minutes with wind speed calculated at 1.5 m/sec.  Considering these factors, the maximum effected radius or distance to the endpoint is calculated at 2 m"

Considering these factors the realistic distance to an endpoint or offsite analysis is actually 0.10 mile with only 25 people affected, the same as chlorine with the mitigation measures in place.\n\nIn addition, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide rooms of the plant have been designed such that even in worst-case scenarios, minimal levels of toxic gas will be released into the atmosphere.  If a chlorine leak does occur it will be detected by the leak detectors in the chlorine feed room, scale room or in the chlorine cylinder storage room and the following systems would be activated. If a chlorine gas leak is detected, an internal alarm within the chlorine building will be activated. When the leak detectors are activated, they will cause the ventilation systems to shut down and automatically activate the scrubber system. This system will remove the contaminated air from the feed or storage via intake piping. Chlorine gas will settle to the lower portions of the room, where the air intake piping is located, allowing it to be picked up and pulled into the caustic scrubbing unit. This caustic solution neutralizes the chlorine gas that is in the air and exhausts it to the atmosphere. One other addition to the scrubber unit is the use of vacuum regular shut off valves on each chlorine cylinder in service. Upon any leak in the feed system will cause a loss of vacuum, forcing an automatic shut off of all chlorine cylinders in service.\n\nMany precautionary measures are taken to prevent leaks from occurring.  Preventive maintenance and constant system monitoring are two of the most important elements comprising proactive risk management at the West Hickman plant.  The following is a brief description of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process at the facility.  Chlorine is pulled into the system through the piping syst"

In the event of a failure of the ventilation system, should there be a leak in the feed room or tank room, the caustic scrubber would still be activated automatically.  Upon investigation of these units, if it is found that the ventilators failed to shut down, the ability to manually override them and to manually shut them down by turning off the power in the motor control center room is available.\n\nIn the event that there is a malfunctioning leak detector, a number of things could occur.  If a leak detector has a weak cell or a bad battery, the alarm system will be activated.  Upon investigating the alarm, the operator can determine whether it is a true leak or a malfunction of the system using a portable gas monitor.  If it is determined that the leak detector has malfunctioned, the individual leak detector can be manually disconnected.    This does not disarm the other unit that is in place.  The likelihood of having both malfunction is remote.\n\nOperations and procedures are very similar for sulfur dioxide.  The sulfur dioxide tank room and feed room also have ventilation systems.  Sulfur dioxide leak detection is utilized, and there are two leak detector systems located in the sulfur dioxide storage room and one in the feed room.\n\nIn the event of a sulfur dioxide leak in the feed or tank room, the following systems will be activated.
