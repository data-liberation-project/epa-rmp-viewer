Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Columbia River Processing to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by OAR 1910.119.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, developed in compliance with the provisions of OAR 1910.38.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  \n\n1.20    Facility Description And Substances Handled\n\n?    Columbia River Processing manufacturing facility processes, stores, and distributes cheese.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n?    The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n?    The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 12,120 pounds of anhydrous ammonia."

Offsite receptors were defined using the LandView V (Version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n1.40    General Accidental Release Prevention Program And Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nColumbia River Processing complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The design and construction of this facility was in accordance with published standards, tests or recommended methods of trade, industry or governmental organizations.  \n\nColumbia River Processing?s written PSM plan incorporates many policies and procedures to ensure safe operation and maintenance of this facility.  Plan elements essential to safe operation of the refrigeration system include employee participation, process hazard information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, management of change, hot-work permits, incident investigation, emergency planning, and compliance audits.  This plan will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary by the Columbia River Processing Director of Environmental and Political Affairs. \n\nTraining is provided to ensure that each employee involved in operating a process has been trained in an overview of the process, the operating procedures, and safety considera"

      "SummaryText": "tions.  This training uses guidelines developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and Refrigeration Engineers Technology Association (RETA).  Only qualified maintenance personnel operate and interact with the refrigeration system.  This minimizes the chances of inadvertent error in operation that could lead to a release of ammonia.  Startup, shutdown, and any onstream adjustments are handled by these qualified persons.  \n\n1.50    Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no significant release of ammonia at Columbia River Processing in the last five years.\n\n1.60    Emergency Response Program\n\nColumbia River Processing has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It complies with the provisions of OR-OSHA regulations, OAR 1910.38.  The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.  This plan has been reviewed with the Boardman Fire Department.\n\nThe approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Columbia River Processing and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\n\n?    Emergency Alarm and Communication System\n?    Safe Rooms, Evacuation Plans, and Assembly Points\n?    Personal Protective Equipment\n\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Boardman Fire Department.  \n\nAll Columbia River Processing personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibil"

All pressure vessels are built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.
