Western Reserve Farm Co-op Inc. employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is a 36 acre complex with two buildings.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred, stored and redistributed as a fertilizer for our farmer owners/members.  Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 212,160 pounds or 40,800 gallons in three tanks.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the largest tank of 18,000 gallons capacity at 85% capacity would be 79,560 pounds actual in tank.  This would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 0.94 miles from the tank.\n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of epuipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 0.56 miles from the tank.\n\nWe have instituted procedures for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Ohio Dept. of Agriculture.\n\nWe have not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 35 years.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is up to date and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive training as part of their new employee orientation.  All agencies and contracted emergency care providers have received training in the hazards associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nIt is the policy of Western Reserve Farm Co-op Inc. to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a release.  We will continue to conduct self audits and compliance inspections of equipment and procedures on a schedule basis in addition to the pe-transfer inspections.  Through our inspection process and insistence of maintaining equipment with the Federal, State,"
