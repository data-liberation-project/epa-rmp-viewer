The in plant system is tested on a frequency ranging from weekly, for the alarm and communications system, to bi-annually for in-plant musters and drills.\n\nIn addition to the in plant portion of the emergency response plan, the Mobile Plant also maintains an active community based emergency response program.  This is done through monthly participation in the Mobile County LEPC as well as with the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency which coordinates mutual aid for the entire Mobile area chemical manufacturing community.  Participation is achieved through planning meetings, public forums, annual emergency drills.  The Cytec Plant also interfaces frequently with community based emergency response groups such as the fire department and local hazardous materials response team.  Plant tours and readiness evaluations for these organizations are conducted on an annual basis.\n\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\n\nSpecific improvements currently planned that will directly improve safety in the plant include:\n\n- Removal of obsolete equipment\n- Upgraded employee training system\n- General equipment upgrades from inspections and employee input\n- Emphasis on behavior safety and individual responsibility to report hazards and operate within procedures."

Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Cytec's way of doing business.  Cytec has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Cytec subscribes to the codes established for Responsible Care \u00ae.\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility has 3 processes that involve regulated substances.\n\nThe melamine-formaldehyde resin manufacturing process makes resins that are used to produce consumer paper products such as paper plates and bathroom tissue.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is formaldehyde solution (37 %).\n\nThe Pilot Plant makes resins, water-soluble organic polymers, and mining chemicals used for the development of new technologies and improving on existing formulations in the mining, water treating and paper markets.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is ammonium hydroxide solution.\n\nThe polyacrylamide emulsion manufacturing process makes water-soluble organic polymers that are used to remove solids from a number of different wastewater applications.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is ammonium hydroxide solution\n\n\u00a9 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nCytec's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n\u00bf EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\u00bf OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\u00bf OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n\u00bf Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\u00bf Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n\u00bf Cytec S"

The procedures are designed to be implemented in case of fire, explosion, chemical release which may arise as a result of our own operations, adjacent operations or the forces of nature.  These procedures are set up to be implemented in two primary areas; 1.) in plant and 2.) in conjunction with the community.\n\n The in plant portion of the emergency response plan provides for employee notification of an emergency through an alarm system and in plant response with operations personnel to take immediate remedial actions.
