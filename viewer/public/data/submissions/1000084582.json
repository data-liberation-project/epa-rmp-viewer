      "SummaryText": "Chemisphere Corporation distributes and blends various chemicals and products to a wide variety of industries from its facility located at 2102 Clifton Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri.  As part of its operation, Chemisphere Corporation utilizes cyclohexylamine at a concentration up to 95% for use in one or more of its products.  \n\n\n\nStorage of cyclohexylamine (95%) occurs in an outdoor, 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The AST is located within a secondary containment structure capable of containing the entire contents of the storage tank.  The raw material is transferred via piping to a blend tank where it is blended with other materials to form a product containing 25% cyclohexylamine.  The product is then piped to an outdoor 17,000-gallon product storage tank located in a secondary containment structure.  The process includes all three tanks and associated piping.  \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves failure of the raw material tank and release of the entire contents to the secondary containment structure.  The facility uses administrative controls to allow the tank to only be filled to 9,000 gallons.  This scenario would spill 9,000 gallons with a release rate of 61.7 pounds/minute.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves accidental uncoupling of the transfer hose during tank filling.  Assuming a typical pumping rate of 175 gallons per minute and a release duration of 10 minutes, this scenario would result in 1750 gallons of material released at a rate of 1202 pounds per minute.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nAll employees involved in handling cyclohexylamine are trained upon hire and annually thereafter in safe handling procedures.  Additionally, written procedures are in place for loading operations and Chemisphere personnel are required to be present during any loading/unloading operations.  Chemisphere has developed an emergency response plan and it is on fi"
