Chemicals are brought on site in bulk quantities (railcars, tank trucks, etc.), repackaged into smaller containers, and then transported to customers on an as-needed basis. Any residual compressed gas is absorbed in an appropriate solution and sold as product.  The regulated substances handled by this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe prevention programs described in this facility's Safety and Safety Training Manuals represent integrated administrative controls intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Many of these prevention programs (e.g., PHAs, compliance audits, incident investigations) result in the development and implementation of additional safeguards (administrative and engineering controls). All covered processes have control systems designed to maintain operating parameters (temperature, pressures, flow, and level) within allowable limits. The covered processes are also equipped with alarms to alert personnel when the operating parameters exceed the allowable limits. This facility developed procedures and conducted training of personnel to familiarize them with the consequences of exceeding allowable limits (safety and operability) to ensure the correct response to the alarms. Safeguards to prevent, detect, or mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facility's Safety and Safety Training Manuals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a seismic evaluation of the facility was conducted on September 28, 1992.  A follow-up seismic evaluation of the facility, which included a walk down review, was conducted on June 2, 1999 in accordance with the 1997 uniform building code.  An updated CalARP Seismic Assessment, including a walk down review, was conducted on October 4, 2006 by Olweny"

      "SummaryText": "d that these accidental releases will ever occur again. The intent of this information exchange is to create an informed community, while also documenting that accidental releases are investigated, and concrete changes are made to protect against recurrence.\r\n\r\nPersonnel at the facility reviewed all incident investigation reports from January 1, 2016 to the present to identify accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  No accidental releases were identified.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nThe facility does not have its own written emergency response plan.  Instead, the facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.  These activities are coordinated through the Los Angeles City Fire Department.\r\n\r\nThe facility does though have a detailed Emergency Action Plan to cover minor incidents at the facility.  The facility's Contingency Plan Manual covers these activities.\r\n\r\n6.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nStudies associated with prevention program elements such as PHAs, incident investigations, management of change, and compliance audits are regularly conducted at this facility to verify designs and to identify potential hazards. Recommendations may be developed as a result of those studies and as a result of equipment inspections, safety meetings, review of industry experience, technology improvements, and employee suggestions. Once formulated, recommendations are reviewed, and corresponding action items are developed to implement each recommendation.\r\n\r\nJCI facility personnel reviewed the following documents to identify all action items that were formulated to reduce the risk (severity or likelihood) of an incident that could have plausibly resulted in an off-site consequence (i.e., the emergency response planning guideline level 2 [ERPG-2"

The system's cameras have state-of-the-art night vision with motion detection. The cameras cover several areas of the railcars, the plant, and the gate. One camera at the gate is focused to capture license plates. In addition to the gate cameras, there are two door phones used at two heights for drivers to call the office for access to the facility. Each door phone has a high-quality camera which provides a clear, close-up view of the driver and the side of the truck. The door phones are also tied into a paging system that will alert all plant and office personnel of incoming requests for entry into the facility. Another door phone placed on the guard shack, which also has a camera, is used for outbound access, and requires a call to the staff to allow exiting the facility.\r\n\r\n7.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario: Entire contents of 180,000-pound railcar of Sulfur Dioxide.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Release Scenario #1: A chlorine container begins leaking at the filling station at any time during the repackaging process, to include immediately before or after the connection or disconnection process, for any reason to include employee error.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Release Scenario #2: A sulfur dioxide container begins leaking at the filling station at any time during the repackaging process, to include immediately before or after the connection or disconnection process, for any reason to include employee error."
