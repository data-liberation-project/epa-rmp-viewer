Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gases used in steel making.  The annealing gas manufacturing processes use hydrogen.  The amounts of hydrogen handled by our facility, exceed the threshold quantities set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nOne of the main products of this facility is a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen in a 3:1 ratio.  This \"annealing gas\" is used by our customer in their steel manufacturing process.  Pure hydrogen and nitrogen gas are blended together in the proper ratio to form the annealing gas.  The pure nitrogen gas is produced onsite in an air separation unit.  The annealing gas is delivered via pipeline to the nearby steel mill.  \n\nPure liquid hydrogen is stored in two 20,000 g"

The liquid hydrogen is vaporized by ambient air vaporizers located adjacent to the tanks, and gaseous hydrogen is piped to the blending process.  Gaseous hydrogen is also used onsite in the argon purification process, and as a backup gas for the steel mill in the event that annealing gas is unavailable.\n\nThe regulated processe at this facility is the liquid hydrogen storage, blend skid, and pipeline backup system.  Hydrogen is the only regulated substances handled at this facility in an amount exceeding a threshold quantity. The maximum amount of hydrogen at this facility is 24,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed  and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n \n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Cleveland Fire Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \n\n\n6.  Planned"
