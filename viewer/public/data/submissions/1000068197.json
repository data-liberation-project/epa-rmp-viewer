The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles 21,951 pounds of ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for dock operations, cooler and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.

In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Stockton has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\nThe C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - Stockton facility has an emergency response plan in effect.
