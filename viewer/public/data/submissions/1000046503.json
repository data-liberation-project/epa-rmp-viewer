Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department so they can plan for a response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, people in the surrounding area and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\t Facility Information\r\nThe primary activity of this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient.\r\n\r\n3.\t Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analysis were completed for all covered processes.  The worst case scenario release assumed that all contents in the largest single vessel were released.  The anhydrous ammonia release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (more likely to occur) scenario assumes the rupture of a transfer hose during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, emergency shutoff valves, and check valves) and operating procedures the TMC uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\n4.\t Accidental Release Program\r\nThis facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency.
