The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\u00b7Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\u00b7Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\u00b7Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\u00b7Prevention Program\n\u00b7Five-Year Accident History\n\u00b7Emergency Response Program\n\u00b7Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nNew Star is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program. New Star has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document New Star policies addressing the implementation of these regulations.  The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and emergency response and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe New Star Salinas facility is a new facility, which will provide product cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  New Star will process some vegetables for the \"fresh cut market\".  This processing includes cooling, cleaning, cutting and packaging vegetables. \n\nCeres Fresh Foods, L.L.C. dba New Star, purchased this facility from Boskovich Farms in 2002. The EPA facility identifier number is the original number assigned to the facility when Boskovich submitted their original RMP. This RMP update includes the recent company name change to NewStar Fresh Foods, L.L.C.  (Note: The company Dunn and Bradstreet Numbers did not change.)\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Salinas.  Ammonia is used as the refriger"

This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, which was built in 1999-2000 with an initial system start-up during Spring 2000. The facility and associated refrigeration system was expanded in 2004, referenced as \"Expansion 2004 Project\". The majority of the ammonia equipment is housed inside buildings. One vessel and the condenser are located outside the Machine Room. The chiller packages are located outside the processing rooms. Much of the piping is located on the roof.  The entire facility is fenced and gated.\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT \nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system  - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n \nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nNew Star's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.  The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented by New Star is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\nKey objectives of New Star Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information chapter)\n2.Thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes).  All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by New Star.  (Addressed u"

(Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4.Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  New Star certifies operators following completion of operator training and New Star's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n5.Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all New Star employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6.\tImplementation of additional measures when changes are planned  (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by New Star's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, New Star has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a New Star Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associat"

(These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7.Verification of New Star's compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program  (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by New Star personnel.  New Star has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8.Minimize employee injury and illness.  (Addressed under New Star's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe New Star facility is new and has no reportable accidental ammonia releases in the last five years.\n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nNew Star's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the Salinas facility.\n\nThis plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary.   The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators.  Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \nUnder New Star's Emergency Response policy, New Star employees who have been trained as \"First Responders\" may initially respond to releases that can be addressed without entering the danger area (i.e. de-energizing equipment).  New Star will evacuate affected area, begin notification process and rely on off-site responders (e.g., the fire department and/or refrigeration contractor).\n\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe Process Hazard Analysis"
