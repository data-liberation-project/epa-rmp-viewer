This facility observes safety precautions in handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS).  This includes procedures for notifying the DPS in the event of an accident involving ammonia.\n\nb. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe regulated substance at this facility is ammonia.  Ammonia is stored for retail sale to farmers as fertilizer.  Ammonia is received by truck and stored in one storage tank.\n\nc. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: As a worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the ammonia tank is released as vapor over a ten minute period.\n\nAlternative Scenario: A more realistic release scenario involving ammonia would be a slow vapor release from a 1/4 inch hole resulting from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld or seal.\n\nd. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training for employees.\n\ne. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving ammonia that require reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\nf. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with the Minnesota DPS, such that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response measures can be implemented.\n\ng. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of a saf"
