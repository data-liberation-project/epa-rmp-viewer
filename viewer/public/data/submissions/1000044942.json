The propane is transloaded from railcar to mobile containers utilizing a Westmor Propane mobile chassis transloader.  Propane is the only substance regulated under the RMP at the COOP Service Inc. Baudette MN facility.  The facility is classified as a Program 2 under the regulation.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at COOP Service, Inc. include:\r\n\u00bf\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner such that unintentional releases are minimized.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\r\n\u00bf\tCorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\r\n\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nThe transload process has the potential to store up to 25 rail cars of propane on a leased rail line (841,250 gallons nominal water capacity), and potential storage of up to 124,000 gallons nominal water capacity of propane in mobile containers at the process location.  \r\nA worst-case release is defined as the loss of the contents of the single larg"

For propane and other flammable substances, the released substance is assumed to explode and generate a pressure wave that can injure people or damage structures. The rule requires determining the distance to a 1 psi overpressure (at 1 psi, windows will break). The maximum quantity of the single largest container is held in a railcar (33,650 gallons nominal water capacity), will result in a 0.4 mile distance to end point.  \r\nThe alternative release scenario examined Piping Break on the transloader. This alternative scenario considers a break in propane piping (3 inch in diameter) leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The distance to the 1 psi endpoint is resulted in a release rate of 4612 lb/minute for a total of 46, 122 lb in 10 minutes with a resulting distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles. \r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nCOOP Service Inc. stores propane, and requires the facility to implement a Level 2 Prevention Program. The Plant has implemented the prevention program requirements and has completed a hazard review. In addition, the Plant has also implemented operating procedures, training, maintenance activities, emergency action plan, and incident investigation procedures. The employees at the Plant are efficient at performing their duties in a manner that prevents incidents and injuries. The COOP Service Inc. facility maintains a training schedule for all employees in the areas of technical expertise, and safety procedures utilizing the CETP Certification training from NPGA (National Propane Gas Association).\r\n\r\nThe facility follows the operation, maintenance and inspection system as designed, and meets the recommended manufacturer guidance requirements.
