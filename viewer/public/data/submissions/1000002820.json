This commitment is demonstrated by the resources \nwe invest in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the \ndesign, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement \nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a \nrelease does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Afton facility, located in Sauget, Illinois, operates a variety of processes to produce \nlubricant additive packages that help meet or exceed a wide range of industry and \ngovernment performance standards.  The most prominent of these include reducing exhaust \nemissions, improving fuel economy, prolonging oil-drain intervals, and extending equipment \nlife.  The facility has one regulated flammable substance (2-methylpropene, commonly \nreferred to as isobutylene) and two regulated toxic substances (chlorine and carbon disulfide).  \n\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances at the facility is a catastrophic \nfailure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar, resulting in a release of 179,000 lb of chlorine gas over a \n10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to \nmanage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation \nmeasures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Because the plant is located in a \npopulated area, the toxic cloud formed by such an event would reach offsite public receptors.\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at the facility is a \nvapor cloud explosion involvin"

The \nmaximum railcar inventory of 160,000 lb is assumed to be released to the atmosphere, to \ncompletely vaporize, and to ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The overpressure \ngenerated by the explosion would reach nearby offsite public receptors.  Although we have \nnumerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for \npassive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\nThe alternative scenario for chlorine is a failure of a 2-in. diameter liquid charge line between \nthe railcar and the vaporizer.  If this scenario were to occur, automatic sensors would detect \nchlorine and shut off flow from the railcar immediately, releasing only the contents of the \nline (approximately 38 lb of chlorine) to the atmosphere.  The toxic cloud formed by such an \nevent would reach public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility boundary.\n\nThe alternative scenario for carbon disulfide is a failure of a 2-in. diameter liquid charge line \nfrom a storage tank to a reactor.  If this scenario were to occur, our operators would shut off \nthe flow from the tank within a few minutes.  For this scenario, however, we chose to \nassume that it takes 1 hour to stop the spill, so that the results from our analysis should be \nlarger than would actually be the case if this event were to occur.  The toxic cloud formed by \nsuch an event would reach nearby public receptors.\n\nThe alternative scenario for flammables is a rupture of an unloading hose from a railcar \ncontaining isobutylene.

For this scenario, however, we chose to assume that it \ntakes 15 minutes to stop the release, so that the results from our analysis should be larger than \nwould actually be the case if this event were to occur.

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA risk management \nprogram (RMP) rule are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA) process safety management (PSM) rule, this summary addresses each of the OSHA \nPSM elements that are part of the RMP prevention program and describes the management \nsystem in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Aftonl facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of PSM and accident \nprevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling \ntechnical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process \nhazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the \nfacility accident prevention program. Ways in which employees can be involved in the \naccident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is \nmaintained at the facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In \naddition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and \nemployee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and \npersonal safety.  The teams typically include members from various areas of the plant, \nincluding operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Sauget, Illinois, facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help \nmaintain safe operation of the processes.

New employees receive basic training in facility operations.  After successfully\ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific\nduties and tasks.

This is accomplished by providing \ncontractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) \nemergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning \nwork.  In addition, the Afton facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance \nduring the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor \nperformance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Afton facility conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the \nprocess safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, \nprocedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to \nplacing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure \nconstruction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems \nare operationally ready.

      "SummaryText": "during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Afton facility \nperiodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by \nthe accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at \nleast every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team \nmembers.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for \nresolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00c2\u00bfs findings are tracked until \nthey are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most \nrecent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the Afton facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued \nsafe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all \nEPA RMP-covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities \nhelp prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and \n(2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Afton facility has safety features \non many units to help (1) contain and control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) \nreduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are \nused in various processes:\n\nRelease detection\n- Chlorine detectors with alarms and automatic shutdown\n- Carbon disulfide detector with alarm\n- Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms and automatic shutdown\n\nRelease containment and control\n- Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and/or automated)\n- Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high \ntemperature)\n- Vessels to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release \n(e.g."

Afton \nhas not experienced any accident in the past 5 years involving an RMP-regulated substance \nthat has resulted in any of the EPA-specified onsite or offsite effects.  One reason for our \nsuccess at preventing accidents is that we address every incident very carefully to determine \nways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe Afton facility maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to \nprotect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of \nprocedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a \nfire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  Specific emergency \nresponse procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and \nmedical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an \nevacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release \noccurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Also, the Afton facility \nhas procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response \nequipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment."

      "SummaryText": "Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific \nemergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary \nbased on modifications made to facility processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency \nresponse program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes \ninforming and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Afton facility is coordinated with the St.\nClair County Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire and police departments, and \nstate and federal agencies through the Incident Command System.  The Afton facility has \nround-the-clock communications capability with appropriate community officials and \nemergency response organizations (e.g., the fire department).  This provides a means of \nfacilitating quick response to an incident, as well as notifying the public of an incident if \nnecessary.  The Afton facility conducts periodic emergency response exercises that involve \nfacility personnel, contractors, and emergency response organizations.  The facility provides \nmonthly refresher training to emergency responders regarding their responsibilities during an \nemergency.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAfton Chemical Corporation resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.\nThe following types of changes are planned:\n\n-  A capital project has been prepared to upgrade plant fencing and intrusion detection using both vibration and motion detection.  Numerous security upgrades have been implemented in the last 3 years.\n-  Fixed fire suppression upgrades are planned to include additional sprinkler systems and water supply reliability improvements.\n-  A new odor scubber is to be installed in the summer of 2004 to increase effectiveness of gas stream scrubbing and reduce the potential for odors being released into the community from our main flare.\n-  Scrubber hold tanks in Un"
