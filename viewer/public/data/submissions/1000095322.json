The facility is located at 5014 E. US Hwy 84, Cowarts, Alabama 36321-4305.  The SIC code for the operation is 2026; the NAICS code is 311511.  The facility has approximately 237 full time employees (management, administrative, plant and drivers) and operates 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History - ?68.155(d)\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia during the previous five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - ?68.155(a)\n\n\n\nThe facility has evaluated and reported one worst case scenario and has evaluated alternate scenarios and reported one which will result in an offsite impact that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accor"

Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours during business/production hours.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the affected portions of the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors that are triggered by the presence of ammonia in the compressor area and refrigerated spaces. The ammonia detectors will trigger a visual/audible alarm if the ammonia level exceeds the detector set points.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - ?68.155(a)\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  This serves as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program - ?68.155(e)\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident response drills"

      "SummaryText": ".  The facility has not experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place in the last five years.  Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more or a release that creates an offsite impact must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Fire Department will be provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - ?68.155(f)\n\n\n\nThe prevention plan includes routine and periodic inspections and audits of the process and prevention programs to identify potential deficiencies.  The Process Hazard Analyses are conducted initially, as part of major additions or modifications and every five years to identify potential hazards in the process and provide recommendations to eliminate or reduce hazards and improve process safety and efficiency.\n\n"
