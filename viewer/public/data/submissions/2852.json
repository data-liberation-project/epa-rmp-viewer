They  may  arrive  before  fire  or  other  emergency  agencies.If  the  police  officer  is  the  first  on  the  scene  of  a hazardous  materials  accident  he/she  will  need  to  identify  the  chemical  involved  in  the  release. Many  chemicals  can  be  lethal  and  explosions  can  occur  before  fire  departments  reach  the  scene.

Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  prepare  and  implement  an  Risk  Management  Plan  in  conformance  with  40  CFR  68,  published  June  20, 1996 ( EPA # 550-Z96-002).\n\nSPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR CHLORINE SAFETY\n\nAll  operators  are instructed  to  read , study  and  understand  the  chlorine  manual  supplied  to  them  by  the  chlorine  institute. The  manual  contains  detailed  information  on  the  safe  usage  of  chlorine  and  chlorine  products.\n\tInhalation  of  chlorine  gas , leaking  from  one  ton  containers,  connections,  or  piping  can  cause  serious  respiratory  tract  irritation  or  injury, unconsciousness,  or  death  due  to  chlorine  poisoning.  For  this  reason  chlorine  storage  containers  and  piping (except  solution  piping ) are  confined  to  the  chlorine  applications  room.  This  room is equipped  with a separate  outside  entrance  and  exhaust  system  that  automatically  comes  on  when:\n1) Doors  are opened\n2) The light switch is turned on.\n3) The outside switch is turned on\n4) The chlorine gas detector sounds an alarm.\nThe  air  in  the  room  is continuously  monitored, if  gas  concentrations  reach  1.0  ppm  an  alarm  is  sounded  outside  the  room, on  the  main  control  panel  and  the  exhaust  fans  start. There  are  observation  windows  so  outside  personnel  can  monitor  work  going  on  inside  the  chlorine  room.. Self  contained  breathing  apparatus,  and  protective  clothing , are  worn  by  all personnel  while  working  inside  the  chlorine  room.\n\n\nPRECAUTIONS  FOR  CHLORINE  HANDLING\n\nA) Chlorine  must  be  handled  by  trained  personnel.\n\nB) Ton  cylin"
