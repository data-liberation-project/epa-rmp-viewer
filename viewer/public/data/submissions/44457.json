Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Antelope Hills Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by ONEOK.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing the cryogenic/turboexpander/demethanizer process in two plants capable of of processing 45,000,000 cubic feet per day.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There are two product surge tanks with a total capacity of 27,500 gallons which contain demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in an amount greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information abo"

Our ongoing analyses of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nWe provided manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons (which are tested semiannually) at several locations within the facility in order to shut down the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.\n\nWe installed gas detectors in the compressor building in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors and alarm the control room.  \n\nWe provided dual seals on the booster pumps.\n\nWe provided high pressure and low-flow shutdown switches on our product pipeline as well as high pressure shutdown on the demethanizer that will vent hydrocarbon vapors to the atmosphere through the relief valve.\n\nWe provided fire extinguishers throughout the facility for extinguishing incipient fires.  These fire extinguishers are inspected annually by third party inspectors and monthly by plant employees. \n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility for many years. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo incident having resulted in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon "

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Antelope Hills Gas Plant with the Roger Mills County Volunteer Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Roger Mills County Sheriff, the Cheyenne Community Hospital, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. The Antelope Hills Gas Plant operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Antelope Hills Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we have achieved and continue to improve upon are as follows:\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensures that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.  \nThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part o"

In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.  \n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Roger Mills County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
