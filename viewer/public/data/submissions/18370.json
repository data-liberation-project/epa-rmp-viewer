We present the risk of a Chlorine gas release. We are in the process of writing an Emergency Response Plan for our facility. We report to the Missouri Emergency Response Commission annually, as required. We participate in the Bates County L.E.P.C.. Our employees will not respond to a leak at the facility, but will evacuate, and notify the Butler Fire Department. The Butler Fire Department has toured our facility, has trained with our Chlorine repair kit, and has Hazardous Materials Technicians on staff."
