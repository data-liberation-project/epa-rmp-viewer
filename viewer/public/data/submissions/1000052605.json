Shasta has instituted a Risk Management Program for their Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68 (chlorine)and CalARP regulations, 19 CCR 2735, chlorine and sulfur dioxide).  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP and CalARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta operates and maintains a wastewater treatment plant, located above the east bank of the Sacramento River in the City of Mt. Shasta, CA in Siskiyou County, and uses chlorine, an RS, for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS. There are two full-time employees at this site.  The plant is normally manned on the day shift Monday through Friday, and an alarm company alerts operators to alarm conditions when the plant is not manned.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is received in ton containers by truck, handled with an electric trolley hoist, and stored on scales inside the building.  The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater effluent prior t"

Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves,  metered through rotameters and rate valves automatically in proportion to flow and setpoint chlorine residual, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Mt. Shasta that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facilities be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the City of Mt. Shasta has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and has plans to establish a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Mt. Shasta which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include the City's written policies and procedures for training of operators , written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\n\n\nPassive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was consider"

Shasta are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\n\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA GISO Section 5189 covering the disinfection and dechlorination processes at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include improvements in operating procedures, installing a wind sock, replacing the manual hoist with a motorized trolley, sealing off the doorway connecting  the chlorine storage room and the rest of the Operations Building, and improving the egress of the ton container storage room by adding a personnel door with panic hardware. The installation of a motorized trolley was accomplished within the last update period.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe City of Mt. Shasta's Emergency Response plan applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Siskiyou County Hazardous Materials Management Group, the agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.

Shasta committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.  The facility plans to move from chlorine disinfection to untraviolet in 2016-2017.  The program will be deregistered when that occurs."
