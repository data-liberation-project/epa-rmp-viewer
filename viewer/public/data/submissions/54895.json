As part of this commitment, Temple-Inland has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Temple-Inland and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Temple-Inland.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the RMP at Temple-Inland New Johnsonville.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n1.1.1  Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nTemple-Inland is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Temple-Inland implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operations, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate the hazards at Temple-Inland.  The basic elements of this program are included in the Temple-Inland Process Safety Management (PSM) plan. \n\n1.1.2  Emergency Response Policies\n\nIn the event of a significant accidental release of a hazardous substance, Temple-Inland controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will minimize the effect on the public and the environment.  Temple-Inland provides response training to Temple-Inland personnel,"

This plan incorporates the use of the LEPC, the Sheriff's department and local fire departments.  \n\n1.2  Temple-Inland New Johnsonville and Regulated Substances\n\nTemple-Inland is an integrated pulp and paper mill involved in the manufacture of corrugating medium.  As part of this manufacturing process, Temple-Inland uses anhydrous ammonia in the production of wood pulp from hardwood chips.  This is the only toxic substance regulated by the RMP rule that is present at this site in quantities above the EPA threshold quantity. \n\n\nProcess                         Program Level               Regulated Substance               Process Quantity\nHardwood Pulping                  3                           Anhydrous Ammonia                   300,000 lbs.\n\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nTemple-Inland performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario. The main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which the public might be affected in a certain way because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  As distances from the source are increased, the potential effect from the hazard is reduced.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-ter"

The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the Temple-Inland processes and as a training guide.\n\nd.  Training.  Temple-Inland trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Temple-Inland training programs include both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Temple-Inland has trained a HAZMAT response team to respond to any hazardous release at the Temple-Inland site. \n\nTraining requirements are reviewed annually to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the mill operating departments/maintenance are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.

These requirements are:\n\n\u00a7 one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in a Program 3 process (i.e., one scenario       representing anhydrous ammonia)\n\n\u00a7 one alternative release scenario for a toxic substance in a Program 3 process (i.e., anhydrous ammonia.)\n\nBoth of these scenarios are included in this RMPlan.\n\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince its inception in 1970, Temple-Inland New Johnsonville has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, Temple-Inland formalized this prevention program for the anhydrous ammonia production processes and storage requirements in order to comply with the 12 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established additional prevention program requirements for potential offsite migration of hazardous chemicals included in the OSHA PSM program.  Temple-Inland is affected by EPA RMP rules as follows:\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of Temple-Inland's prevention programs that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.  These elements are an integral part of the OSHA PSM program which governs these on site prevention and emergency response elements.\n\n\n1.4.1  Program 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Temple-Inland Program 3 prevention program applies to the mill processes and storage systems which involve anhydrous ammonia.

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Temple-Inland (MSDS), (2) operating parameters of the equipment at Temple-Inland, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at Temple-Inland.  Temple-Inland ensures that this process safety information is available to all Temple-Inland employees, the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), local fire departments, and other emergency responders.\n\nb.  Process Hazard Analysis.  Temple-Inland performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  Temple-Inland primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\nc.  Operating Procedures.  Temple-Inland production operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n\u00a7 steps for safely conducting activities\n\n\u00a7 applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process"
