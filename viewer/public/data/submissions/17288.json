The substances are used in the treatment of wastewater at the Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government facility located at Louisiana State Highway 57 near Houma, Louisiana.  The individual storage containers of the covered process do not exceed the threshold quantities outlined in 40 CFR Part 68; however, the containers for each substance are maintained in close enough proximity as to be considered one process for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The facility process met the Program 2 criteria, because it did not qualify for consideration under Program 1 due to the distance of the nearest receptor within the impact areas identified during the evaluation of the worst-case scenarios, and did not qualify for Program 3, because the facility is not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirement.   \n\nProgram 2 requirements include: 1) the development of a management program which identifies the responsibilities of management personnel relative to the Risk Management Program, 2) a Prevention Program to establish procedures and document information that will help to prevent an accidental release, 3) an Emergency Response Program that outlines the necessary procedures and contacts in the event of an accidental release, 4) and the evaluation of a worst case and alternate scenario of a potential release from the covered process.   \n\nThe TPCG "

These policies are documented in written operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n1.0  PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION\n1.1 APPLICABILITY OF 40 CFR SECTION 68\n1.1.1 Stationary Source Identification\n\nClean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(2)(c) defines stationary sources as \"any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substances emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one or more contiguous properties, which are under the control of the same person, and from which an accidental release may occur.\"   \n\nThe Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government-South Treatment Plant (TPCG-STP) meets the definition of stationary source.\n\n1.1.2 Regulated Substance Identification\n\nA facility is subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68) if they handle, manufacture, use or store any of the toxic and/or flammable substances listed in 40 CFR 168.130 above the specified threshold quantities in a process.  A review of site operations revealed that two substances stored on site were regulated under Section 68.130, which include chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Seven 2,000-pound chlorine tanks and seven 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide tanks are stored in the chlorine building next to the chlorine contact chamber.  The total maximum on-site storage of chlorine is 14,000 pounds, and the total maximum on-site storage of sulfur dioxide is 14,000 pounds.

For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\"\n\nOne process was identified at TPCG-STP.  As stated above, seven 2,000-pound chlorine tanks and seven 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide tanks are located at the plant site.  Both substances are considered one process due to the close proximity of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks to each other.   \n \n1.2 PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe process identified at the TPCG South Treatment Plant was determined to meet the criteria for Program 2 status.  The facility has had no accidents within the past five years, and the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Process Safety Management (OSHA, PSM) requirements, because it is a local governmental facility.  However, the endpoint for the worst case scenario falls beyond the boundaries of the facility and reaches public receptors including residences and schools.  Because the process does not meet Program 1 or Program 3 status, it must fall within the requirements of Program 2.  The program criteria are described in the following sections.\n\n1.2.1 Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nA worst case scenario evaluates a release of the largest quantity of the regulated substance from a single vessel or a release from a process line failure, whichever results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  One worst-case release scenario is required to represent all toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.\n\nThe worst case release scenario considered included the failure of one 2,000-pound sulfur dioxide tank.

The program assumed that the release was liquid sulfur dioxide under pressure in an urban setting with many obstacles with the given default values.  The endpoint was determined to be 3.1 miles from the center of the facility.   \n\n1.2.2    Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario is an event that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and that will reach an endpoint offsite.  One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance held above the threshold quantity is required.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was considered to be the sheer of a process line of >-inch diameter resulting in the release of liquid chlorine occurring over a period of 10 minutes.  The alternative release scenario was calculated using RMP*Comp, and the distance to the endpoint was determined to be 1.60 miles from the center of the facility.  \n\nAn alternative release scenario was also determined for a sheer of a >-inch diameter process line resulting in a release of liquid sulfur dioxide occurring over a period of 10 minutes.  The alternative release scenario was calculated using RMP*Comp, and the distance to the endpoint was determined to be 1.40 miles from the center of the facility.  A printout of the RMP*Comp alternative release scenario is provided in Appendix C.\n \n1.2.3    Management Program\n\nRegulations require that a management system be developed to oversee the implementation of the risk management program (RMP).
