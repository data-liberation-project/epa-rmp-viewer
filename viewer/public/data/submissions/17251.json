      "SummaryText": "Policy Statement\nIt is the Columbus Water Works' (CWW) policy to operate safe water and wastewater treatment plants, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the processes and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment.  The policy includes working with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the North Columbus Water Resource Facility (WRF).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substance Handled\nPrimary Activities\nWater treatment.\n\nUse of Regulated Substance\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  Other possible uses of chlorine are odor control and iron removal.\n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\nChlorine at Water Treatment Plant:  \nTotal Amount Stored:  12 one-ton containers, equivalent to 27,600 pounds.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nChlorine\nWRS:  Failure of one liquid chlorine container in the chlorine storage room, resulting in a release of 2,300 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  The containers are stored in an enclosed building.  Passive mitigation is considered because the building is enclosed.  Therefore, the release rate of 0.96 kg/s is modeled using DEGADIS 2.1.\n\nDistance to Endpoint:  Under the worst-case weather conditions prescribed by the RMP rule, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm is 2.03 miles or 3.27 km, beyond which there will be enough dispersion that the hazard to the public will no longer exist.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\nChlorine \nARS:  Release of chlorine from a pipe quarter-inch in diameter connecting the chlorine container to the feed manifold.  For a release duration of 20 minutes, the release rate within the building is 0.042 kg/s. The actual release rate is 55 percent of the total chlorine released in the enclosed building because of passive mitigation .  Therefore, the release rate fr"

The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, and operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the RMP rule.  A hazard review was conducted at this facility using a \"What-If\" analysis.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe North Columbus WRF has never had a release of chlorine resulting in offsite dispersion or property damage, or in injuries onsite.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe CWW has an Emergency Response Program that applies to the North Columbus WRF, which coordinates response efforts with the local fire department's Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team, the police department, and the hospital.  Response activities also have been discussed with the Georgia Emergency Management Office.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nIt was observed during the hazard review that the North Columbus WRF has the necessary equipment and the operating and training procedures required for the safe operation of the chlorination system.  However, the following recommendations for improving the safety of the chlorination process were made:\n1. Quarterly inspections of chlorine leak detectors\n2. Installation of a wind sock to indicate wind direction during an accidental release"
