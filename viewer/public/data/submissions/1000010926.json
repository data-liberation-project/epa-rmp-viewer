      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass manufacturing rigid polyurethane foam board insulation.  Due to the environmental regulations requiring the facility to discontinue the use of hydrochloroflourocarbons (HCFCs), which are known ozone depleting substances, the facility will be replacing it with Pentane, which is the only regulated substance present at our facility. The Pentane will serve as the blowing agent.   \n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Additionally, the facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The checklist technique is used to complet"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA update was performed on 08/01/2002.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The operating procedures will be reviewed and modified, if necessary, prior to start-up on"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process conditions will be promptly notified of the modification and will be offered the appropriate training.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at The Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site.  A safety review will be conducted prior to start-up on or about February 1, 2003.  The review will be constructed to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site conducts audits on an annual basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted in March 2006.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct spe"

The Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCurrently, there are no changes planned to improve facility safety.  However, equipment and facility safety inspections and process hazard analyses (PHA) are completed periodically to ensure that facility safety is not compromised. All inspection findings and PHAs are reviewed and addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nDow Chemical Pennsauken Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\nThe Dow Chemical Pennsauken Site carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nPennsauken Township OEM is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n"
