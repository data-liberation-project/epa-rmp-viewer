      "SummaryText": "Overview:\nAerofil Technology, Inc. (Aerofil) owns and operates a contract aerosol packaging operation in Sullivan, Missouri (Site). Our Site maintains eleven above-ground storage tanks (ASTs). These ASTs range in capacity from 5,000 gallons to 18,000 gallons (129,000 gallons total), which contain various combinations of propane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, and difluoroethane in excess of the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) presented under 40 CFR 68, more commonly known as the Risk Management Program.    These substances are considered regulated flammable substances by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and train our personnel combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Plan.:\nOur written Emergency Response plan is written in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Regulations 29 CFR 1910.38.  The purpose of the plan is to ensure the protection of our employees in an emergency situation (fire, tornado, chemical spill, or other emergency).  The personal safety of each employee is and always will be of primary importance to Aerofil Technology, Inc.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency authorities. Aerofil Technology has emergency response plans coordinated with the Sullivan Fire Department.  A walk-through of the plant is conducted every year with the Fire Department.\n\nPrevention Program:\nAerofill Technology has a prevention program in place that meets the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and the EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Employees have been trained of the procedures associated with the processes and the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n5-Year Accident History:\nAerofil Technolgy has not had any accidental releases of flammable substances that have resulted in off-site damage."
