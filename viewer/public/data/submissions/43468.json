EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Freetown Plant workers, the public, and the environment.  As a member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA), ISP implements the principles of Responsible Care to ensure a safe and environmentally sound operation.  In addition, as part of this commitment, the Freetown Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage risk at ISP Freetown and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management program at the Freetown Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of that Risk Management Program. \n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response policies\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Plant implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel will take appropriate action to minimize the effects of the release and, if necessary, contacts the local fire departments to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.\n\nISP Freetown's Site General Manager has overall responsibility for the development and impleme"

However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site General Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site General Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on an organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), accident prevention program, RMP hazard assessment and Risk Management Plan has been delegated jointly to the Environmental Manager and the Health/Safety/Security Manager.  In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2    ISP?s Freetown Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility situated on three contiguous parcels totaling approximately 170 acres, located on the Freetown-Fall River town boundary.  The plant is within the city limits of Freetown, MA, about one half mile west of Route 24 and 5 miles north of Interstate 195.  The site is bounded by the Taunton River and Barnaby?s Cove, the Riverfront Business Park, South Main Street, the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, and a residential housing development.\n\nThe ISP Freetown Plant makes a variety of products.  One of the feed chemicals that is used at ISP Freetown is Vinyl Acetate (VA).  VA is a toxic and flammable substance that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule as a toxic substance and is present in one of our processes above the specified EPA threshold quantity of 15,000 lbs.\n\n1.3    Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ISP Freetown Plant.  Because Vinyl Acetate, which is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation, is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management ("

The PSM program at this facility has been extended, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n1.3.1    Employee participation\n\nISP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and incident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and plant and process inspection teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the site incident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  This plan is reviewed for accuracy and updates every three years.  In addition, the Freetown Plant has a number of initiatives underway that addresses process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include safety walkthroughs, housekeeping inspections, and a site safety committee, typically comprised of members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n1.3.2    Process Safety Information\n\nThe Freetown Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and "

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known safety concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in their product/process operating procedures.  The Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls, monitoring instruments, and highly trained personnel.\n\nThe Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n1.3.3    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Freetown Plant has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.  \n\nThe Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The Plant also utilizes the What-if/Checklist Analysis technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as "

Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on corporate risk acceptance criteria.  ISP utilizes a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) method to guide in prioritization of these improvements.  This ensures that potential accident scenarios with the highest risks receive immediate attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n1.3.4    Operating Procedures\n\nThe Freetown Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1) unit startup\n\n(2) normal operations\n\n(3) temporary operations\n\n(4) emergency shutdown\n\n(5) normal shutdown.\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.

New employees receive basic training on site operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n1.3.6    Contractors\n\nThe Freetown Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n\n\n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n\n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n\n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n\n(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n\n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \n\n(6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n\n\n(1) information about safety and health hazards, \n\n(2) emergency response plan requirements, and \n\n(3) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.\n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains a Contractor Safety Program, which specifically"

The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n1.3.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Freetown Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain storage tanks, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\n\n(1) conducting training,\n\n(2) developing written procedures,\n\n(3) performing inspections and tests,\n\n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \n\n(5) applying quality assurance measures.\n\nIn combination; these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  \n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on\n\n(1) an overview of the process,\n\n(2) safety and health hazards,\n\n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n\n(4) emergency response plans, and \n\n(5) applicable safe work practices\n\nto h"
