A secondary alarm system provides low-level alarm text messaging to refrigeration technicians when sensors detect ammonia at 20PPM, enabling early problem detection.

Cutting-edge safety controls are engineered directly into the plant.  Refrigeration process engineering was provided by Snowden Engineering of Salinas, CA; the refrigeration system installing contractor was Kemper Refrigeration.  Ongoing maintenance is now managed via Dandy's relationship with WPS.  \r\n\r\nTwo separate companies employing entirely separate workforces operate at the Plant: Dandy Cooling Company (Dandy) and Duda Farm Fresh Foods (Duda).  Dandy owns the plant and refrigeration equipment except for several water chillers used by Duda for processing fresh produce.  Dandy is responsible for cooling operations, and shipping of fresh product.  Duda is responsible for processing and packaging of freshly harvested and pre-cooled celery.  Dandy receives the fresh product and pre-cools it via vacuum cooling (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).  The pre-cooled celery is then delivered to the Duda side of the Plant for processing and packaging.

The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The Dandy Plant and PSM Program are specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Dandy to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \r\n\r\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.

Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).    As inspection and maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific task for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the service call system. Tasks are then tracked to completion through the service call system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Dandy and WPS reduce equipment operational problems and potential for releases.  WPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\r\n\t\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIt had become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from a system was one of the most common ammonia release incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a solution to this issue.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  These types of valves are installed at each of the oil drain points in the system.\r\n\r\nOther release prevention steps:\r\n\r\n-Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at the Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank.\r\n-A compu"
