The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The Dandy Plant and PSM Program are specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Dandy to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \n\n\n\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The ammonia process is equipped with a state-of-the-art monitoring, control and alarm system.  The system is permitted by the Oxnard Fire/CUPA agency according to locally adopted code requirements (CFC Article 63-2001) circa 2007."

If and when an ammonia leak is detected, notifications and alarms are provided to management, employees and refrigeration technicians according to alarm intensity.  Automatic shutdown and ventilation systems are activated according to pre-set parameters.  In the event of a major release involving the Refrigeration Room, the supervising alarm company provides direct and immediate notification to Oxnard Fire/CUPA in addition to the other alarms and management notifications.  A secondary alarm system provides low-level alarm text messaging to refrigeration technicians when sensors detect ammonia at 20PPM, enabling early problem detection.  Our policy is to regularly test and maintain the monitoring, control and alarm systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components on a continuous basis. \n\n\n\nThe Company has adopted a \"Non-responding Facility Emergency Response Policy\".  The Plant's California Hazardous Material Business Plan was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements (i.e. notify and evacuate).  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Oxnard Fire/CUPA); the CUPA inspects the plant and receives copies of the Business Plan updated at regular intervals.  The CUPA has been involved in the development of the plant from the initial permitting stage, and a CUPA Representative was present during the initial (2008) and also most recent (2013) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  It is our policy to maintain compliance and a good working relationship with the Oxnard Fire/CUPA.\n\n\n\nThe facility is supported by its partner company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS), for maintenance and emergencies.

The facility was constructed in 2007 and began operating in early 2008.  Building space occupies approximately 67,000 square feet on a 5.5 acre lot.  The refrigeration process is a state-of-the-art system engineered and installed according to the codes and standards locally adopted by the City of Oxnard circa 2007.  Cutting-edge safety controls are engineered directly into the plant.  Refrigeration process engineering was provided by Snowden Engineering of Salinas, CA; the refrigeration system installing contractor was Kemper Refrigeration.  Ongoing maintenance is now managed via Dandy's relationship with WPS.  \n\n\n\nTwo separate companies employing entirely separate workforces operate at the Plant: Dandy Cooling Company (Dandy) and Duda Farm Fresh Foods (Duda).  Dandy owns the plant and refrigeration equipment except for several water chillers used by Duda for processing fresh produce.  Dandy is responsible for cooling operations, and shipping of fresh product.  Duda is responsible for processing and packaging of freshly harvested and pre-cooled celery.  Dandy receives the fresh product and pre-cools it via vacuum cooling (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).  The pre-cooled celery is then delivered to the Duda side of the Plant for processing and packaging.  When the product is packaged and ready for shipping it is moved to the Dandy refrigerated storage side of the facility until shipped. The facility is open year-around with a busy season from "

Annual refrigeration equipment maintenance is performed during low-season summer months.\n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3) CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Refrigeration equipment consists of Compressors, Pressure Vessels, Evaporative Condenser, Evaporators (Room Units), Water Chillers, HydroVac&trade; Vacuum Tubes and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate codes & standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves.  Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at an ammonia- water diffusion tank.  Pre-qualified personnel check the refrigerating system daily and operating parameters are continuously monitored via computer. \n\n\n\nThe vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product.  The vacuum tubes are considered portable equipment and may move seasonally depending on market conditions & demand.

Dandy orchestrates its PSM Program with participation from WPS, Duda, Contractors, and Oxnard Fire/CUPA.  \n\n\n\nWPS is the company that inspects and performs mechanical maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed.  Written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac&trade; Vacuum Tubes).    As inspection and maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific task for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the service call system. Tasks are then tracked to completion through the service call system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Dandy and WPS reduce equipment operational problems and potential for releases.  WPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n    \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIt had become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from a system was one of the most common ammonia release incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves were installed as a solution to this issue.  If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  These types of valves are installed at each of the oil drain points in the system.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps:\n\n\n\n-Pressure relief valves are piped to a common header that terminates at the Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank.\n\n-A compu"
