Chlorine, a substance considered hazardous by the EPA, is used to manufacture bleach at this facility.  Because chlorine is a regulated substance, OnLine Packaging, Inc. must comply with the EPA\u0092s Chemical Accident Prevention regulations (40 CFR part 68) pertinent to Program 3 facilities.  Compliance involves \ndeveloping and implementing a RMP, and submitting this RMP to the EPA.\n\nAt the OnLine Packaging, Inc. plant in Plover, Wisconsin, the maximum inventory of chlorine on-site is two 90-ton tank cars located on a railroad spur adjacent to the building.  Only one tank car is put in-service at a time; the remaining car (if present) is closed and locked down.  Liquid chlorine is piped from the in-service tank car into the building where it is reacted, under carefully controlled conditions, with caustic soda to produce bleach for consumer use.  A detailed description of the operating procedures and the plant layout are contained in the Chemical Process Safety Plan (CPSP) required by OSHA, available at the OnLine Packaging, Inc., Plover facility.\n\nThe OnLine Packaging, Inc. Plover plant has been in operation since 1996 and has never had an accidental release of chlorine in any quantity.  OnLine Packaging, Inc. also operates plants in Michigan City, Indiana, and Ardmore, Oklahoma, neither of which have ever had an accidental release of chlorine of any reportable quantity.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine, this emergency response plan calls for certain internal procedures and actions to be taken in addition to calling 911 to summon the responding agencies (e.g. Plover Fire Department, Plover Emergency Management, Portage County Emergency Management).  Provisions are also included for contacting the National Emergency Response Center and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  In addition, the Employee E"

No changes are planned at this time that will alter the effectiveness of this RMP.  However, if continued operations indicate the need, changes will be implemented, and this RMP will be updated to ensure continued compliance with EPA standards."
