Assai Energy, LLC, is a subsidiary of Archaea Holdings, LLC.  The Facility is high BTU renewable natural gas (RNG) plant. The Facility will (1) accept landfill biogas (LFG) from the Keystone Sanitary Landfill and Alliance Landfill, (2) clean, separate and convert the LFG to pipeline grade RNG, and (3) inject the RNG into an existing UGI Utilities natural gas distribution system. \n\n\n\nThe operating intent of Assai Energy is to beneficially reuse LFG, converting raw LFG to pipeline grade RNG. If not beneficially reused, LFG either escapes to the atmosphere (contributing to global warming) or is destroyed via combustion in a flare.  The Facility is sized to process between 20,000 and 22,500 standard cubic feet per minute of raw LFG.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule based on handling > 10,000-lbs. of a flammable mixture containing methane (an RMP regulated flammable material) in concentrations exceeding 1%.  Since the flammable mixture meets NFPA-4 criteria, it is considered regulated under the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nIt is Assai Energy's intent to fully comply with the requirements of the RMP rule, including development and implementation of the required RMP program elements.  The objective of the Facility's RMP Program is to ensure that programs and procedures are in-place to safely manage potential hazards related to processing and handling the flammable mixture.  During the design phase of the project, a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology to identify potential hazards, evaluate design safeguards to prevent, detect or mitigate hazards, and make recommendations where appropriate to further reduce hazards.  The Facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) including procedures for internal communication and evacuati"
