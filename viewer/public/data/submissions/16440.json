      "SummaryText": "Worthington Foods, Inc. is a food production facility, specializing in products that promote healthy living, located at 1675 Fairview Road, Zanesville, OH. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for production and storage operations. Our refrigeration system has been under the OSHA, PSM threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds until June , 1999. Expansion of the storage facilities has made it necessary to increase the capacity of the refrigeration system bringing the total system charge to 10,640 pounds.  We started preliminary work on our PSM program in April , 1999 but have yet to complete several of the required elements. We expect to have everything completed for both PSM and RMP by August of 1999.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Substance:\nOur worst-case release is the failure of the largest vessel in our refrigeration system. This vessel is\ncalled the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) and has a maximum capacity of 8,400 pounds. The engine room has an air volume of 64,000 cubic feet and roof ventilation produces 25 room air exchanges per hour. Using the tables and equations found in chapter 4 of  EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the toxic endpoint was calculated at 1.00 miles. Based on census data provided by Landview III, within this radius is a population of 450, one school (Vandenbark School), residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. No hospitals are located within this area. \n\nAlternative release scenario for a toxic substance:\nThe alternative release toxic endpoint was also determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for\nAmmonia Refrigeration reference tables and equations. A pressure relief valve failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided in the RMP Guidance, a 10 minute release of ammonia at 130 lbs/min, from the High Pressure Receiver relief valve, would affect an area of .20 miles. The estimated population, according to Landview III, within dis"

There are no schools or hospitals within this radius. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\nWorthington Foods has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. We have also coordinated efforts with the Zanesville Fire Department to establish a joint response program. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in\nHazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response, 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel\nwill assess each release situation and determine the appropriate emergency response to initiate.\nThis could be by simply tightening a packing nut or flange bolt or initiating a system shut down.\nWorthington Foods  has established written operating procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system and has included in those procedures the Emergency Shutdown and isolation in the event of a release. We have also purchased Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \nThere have been no accidental releases in the past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nWorthington Foods, to maintain the mechanical integrity and safety"
