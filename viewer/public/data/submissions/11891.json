Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of potable water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\n    Six wastewater treatment plants operated by WSSC provide sewage treatment. Every day an average of 181 million gallons of wastewater from Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties move to facilities through 4,900 miles of sewers maintained by WSSC.  The six WSSC wastewater treatment plants have a combined capacity of over 73 million gallons per day (mgd). Under the Inter-municipal Agreement, WSSC is allocated 169 mgd of Blue Plains 370 mgd capacity.  WSSC, in turn, pays a share of the Blue Plains operating and capital expenses. \n\nIV.    POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n\n    A six-member commission governs WSSC--three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\n    The Commissions powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\n    The Commissions major functions are to:\n\n-    provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties,\n\n-    approve the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and \n\n-    establish water consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be  levied.\n\n    The Commission also:\n\n-    reviews prel"

THE BUREAU OF OPERATIONS\n\n    The Bureau of Operations is responsible for providing overall supervision, management, coordination, and administration of the Water and Wastewater Divisions.  The Bureau Office formulates operating policy and procedures, provides technical advice to the Commission and staff, and participates in inter and intra-agency meetings.    The Bureau Director serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Regional Committee, and the Principal Civil Engineer serves as Chairman of the Blue Plains Technical Committee.  These Committees are charged with administration of the Inter-municipal Agreement, or IMA, which governs regional coordination on Blue Plains issues.  The Bureau Director also serves as WSSCs representative to the Council of Governments Environmental and Public Works Directors Committee (a committee which develops environmental policy recommendations for the Board of Directors), the Montgomery County Water Quality Advisory Group (which advises the Council on water policies) and the Chairman of the WSSC Plumbing Board (which makes policy recommendations regarding the Plumbing Code).  The Bureau Director provides the supervision, management, and administrative control of the Water and Wastewater Divisions.\n\nVI.

The Division is responsible for the operational readiness of treatment plants currently not in service so that they are capable of being placed back in service when needed.  The Division also provides support for other organizations within the Commission, such as the Systems Maintenance Division, and the Industrial Discharge Control Section, by assisting in developing research projects and testing.  Support is also given to organizations outside the Commission, such as the US Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Maryland Environmental Services, and the Maryland Department of the Environment.\n\n    The Division operates six wastewater treatment plants, with an average daily flow of 73 mgd.  In addition to the seven plants there are thirty-nine (39) wastewater-pumping stations operated by the Division.  Five (5) of the wastewater treatment plants are covered by the CAAA 112 (r) requirements; two of the plants do not use the EPA threshold chemicals. \n\nPISCATAWAY WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nThe Piscataway Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located at 11 Farmington Road West in Accokeek, Maryland. It is our mission to protect and enhance the environmental quality of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, while meeting the wastewater needs of approximately 150,000 people in the southwest quadrant of Prince Georges County. The Piscataway WWTP is designed to treat 30 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater. It employs a Step Feed Biological Nitrogen Removal process, followed by chemical phosphorous removal, secondary clarification, gravity filtration, chlorination, chemical pH adjustment, and dechlorination prior to release into the Potomac River. The current plant average flow is approximately 20 mgd. Plant biosolids are dewatered and nutrients are returned to the soil for beneficial reuse through application on agricultural land.

Piscataway WWTP has also received the Prince Georges County Beautification Award in 1988, 1991, and 1992. In 1998, the plant was the proud recipient of the Governor's Award of Excellence.\n\nVII.    PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Commission accidental release prevention program is part of the agencys overall Safety & Health Program and involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to ensure our workers and the public a safe environment.  The RMP requirement is essentially an expansion of the OSHA Process Safety requirement and the Employee and Community Right to Know programs that have been in existence for a number of years.   \n\n    Hazardous material has always been recognized as a unique hazard for our employees and the public; therefore, we have made every possible effort to ensure the proper and safe use of all hazardous materials.  WSSCs chemical safety prevention program includes: the availability of personal protective equipment; obtaining and use of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS); designing facilities for safety and accident prevention; training and educating employees on chemical systems and processes;  planning and practicing for emergency situations; requiring consultants and contractors to abide by established safety practices; sharing of information with"

Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy and thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.  The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process. Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and provide maximum protection to our environment.\n\nIX.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PLANNING\n\nThe Piscataway WFP has an written emergency response and planning program.

Some training courses related to emergency response are requirements for Operators to maintain their plant certifications by the Maryland Department of the Environment. \n\nA WSSC staff member from the Safety Section is a member of the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and attends the LEPC meetings in Prince Georges County, the site of Piscataway WWTP.  He assists the plant and fire department in coordinating emergency response planning and training procedures for the plant. Prince Georges County Fire Department officials visit the facility annually conducting walk around inspections of the chemical storage areas and the plant in general.  WSSC and the fire officials have an excellent working relationship and are both prepared for on site plant emergencies.\n\nWSSC will share with the Prince Georges and the local fire departments our Risk Management Plan for this facility and any future amendments.  Our goal is to provide amendments or updates to the LEPCs within 30 days of the final action.\n\nAdditionally, if any future offsite consequence analysis identifies potential exposure to residents outside of the Prince Georges County LEPC jurisdiction, the WSSC Safety Manger shall ensure that the impacted LEPC is advised of the potential offsite consequence. \n\n\n                    Safety Manager (6/99)\n                    Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission\n                    14501 Sweitzer Lane\n                    Laurel, Maryland 20707\n                    301-206-7060"
