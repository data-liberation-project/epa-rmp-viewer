Johns Manville is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  The Fernley plant will follow the same, proactive approach to accident prevention and mitigation and will comply fully with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), among other regulatory requirements.  These programs will be implemented prior to the introduction of pentane at the site in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\nThis facility will manufacture polyisocyanurate insulation panels for the construction industry. A flammable mixture that includes two regulated substances, pentane and isopentane, is used in the manufacturing process.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nThe hypothetical worst-case scenario is a failure of the 45,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (90%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to hazard modeling software, using worst-case assumptions, impacts from this explosion could cause injuries and damage property located in an area between the storage tank and the hazard endpoint.  The hazard endpoint in this case corresponds to an overpressure of 1 psi and is estimated to extend 0.5 miles from the storage tank.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a hose rupture caused by a truck that pulls away while the hose is still connected to the pentane tank.  This would result in a spill of approximately 7 gallons (this amount is the maximum quantity of pentane that could be contained in the hose.)  If a spark were to ignite the spilled liquid and vapors, the resulting explosion could impact persons or property"

      "SummaryText": " located within 150 feet of the unloading area.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of a pentane release in accordance with the OSHA PSM standard and the EPA RMP.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program are described below:\n* An in-depth Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the system was conducted prior to startup, and numerous risk reduction measures have been implemented.  Qualified personnel will revalidate the PHA every five years.\n* The pentane system was designed in accordance with applicable codes and standards (NFPA, ANSI, ASME, etc.)  A Pre-Startup Safety Review confirmed that construction and equipment comply with design specifications.\n* Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who will receive refresher training at least every three years.\n*Critical equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure proper operating conditions.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe pentane process is a newly installed process.  There have been no accidents involving pentane.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nA written emergency plan is maintained at the facility, and Johns Manville personnel will be trained in proper notification and evacuation procedures.  In the event of an emergency, this facility would request immediate assistance from the North Lyon County Fire Protection District.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nSafety has been part of the working culture at Johns Manville for many years.  The pentane process is current state of the art and is designed, constructed, and maintained to be as safe as feasibly possible.  At this time, no further improvements are planned."
