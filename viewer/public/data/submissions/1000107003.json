The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals, L.P.), instructions and recommendations.\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Baltimore Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Baltimore City Fire Department and request their assistance. The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire capability. The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Baltimore City Fire Department and Baltimore City/County Emergency Management Agency. The Baltimore City Fire Department has participated in the initial PSM/RMP training session for this system.\nWe also maintain a relationship with the Baltimore City Fire Department. Tours and drills with members of local emergency response organizations are held routinely. These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the terminal.\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWe are continually striving to make the Motiva - Baltimore Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community.\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Motiva looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. The Baltimore City Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additionally, Motiva will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns."

Motiva Enterprises LLC\n- Baltimore Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Baltimore Terminal.\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices.
