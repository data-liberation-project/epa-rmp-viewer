Blue Starr in Claremore, Oklahoma. The Facility treats water drawn from Claremore Lake to drinking water standards for residential and industrial use. The Facility uses one (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68). \n\nThe goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of chlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to mitigate the severity of any release that does occur. The Risk Management Program includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency action plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification of the Claremore Fire Department. The Claremore Fire Department will be responsible for responding to the emergency and directing any required public evacuation or sheltering in place. The Facility has discussed this Emergency Response Plan with the Claremore Fire Department and members of the Claremore Fire Department have inspected the facility. The Claremore Fire Department has the necessary equipment required to seal a leak in a chlorine 1 ton container. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented the Risk Management Program's Level 3 Release Prevention Program. Under this program, the Facility has compiled process safety information and performed a process hazard analysis, developed and implemented written operating procedures and trained the employees that operate or maintain the chlorine syste"

Prior to implementing any change to the chlorine system, a management of change procedure will be adhered to including a pre-startup review of the chlorine system. \n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Facility is approximately 8,000 pounds contained in the two (4) chlorine one ton-containers and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The chlorine equipment is housed in a building., however the one ton-containers are delivered by truck and are offloaded outside of the Chlorine Room then moved inside and locked up.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n"
