The programs involve a wide-range of senior management personnel (including Environmental Manager and Safety Manager). Additionally, Perdue conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel. Perdue's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans. Perdue's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n* Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n1. Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\n\nAmmonia is used for refrigeration purposes. The facility operates two machine rooms a single- stage, anhydrous ammonia (R- 717) refrigeration system in the processing area, and a three- temperature, single-stage system in the remote recirculation room. The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the processing mechanical rooms with the exception of two condensers located on the roof and piping located outside throughout the facility. The entire refrigeration system is a closed loop, liquid recirculation system (Air Chill System) and gravity-fed system (Blast Tunnel Freezer). The total system storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia is s 10827 pounds.\n\n* General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPerdue maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. Perdue also util"

As part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and monitoring system multiple times per shift with observations recorded.\n\n* Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n\n* Emergency Response Program\n\nPerdue has implemented a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan in accordance with the OSHA PSM regulations. The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding Emergency Response organization and procedures, as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness.. Perdue has also developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to address other emergency response related incidents such as bomb threats, spills or releases of hazardous materials, evacuation, and tornados or dangerous weather conditions. The facility is currently a non-response facility. Assistance during an emergency or chemical release is coordinated with the Skagit County LEPC and Mount Vernon Fire Department.\n\n* Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDraper Valley Farms has installed an ammonia gas detection system and exhaust fans in the Mechanical Room and Remote Recirculation Room. In order to minimize the exposure of facility personnel in the event of a release, exhaust fans will be activated if the ammonia concentration is detected inside the rooms above threshold concentrations. The facility also updated the alarm system for the blast compressor and air chill system. Draper continues to conduct periodic vibration analysis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system. In 2025, the facility plans to conduct an ammonia contamination analysis annually. The facility plans to add backup power for the ammonia sensors and alarm in the ammonia machine rooms. In addition, as part of Draper Valley Farms' continuous improvement philosophy, Draper Valley Farms facilities continue to identify and u"
