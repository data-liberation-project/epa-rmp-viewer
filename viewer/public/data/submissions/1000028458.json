As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, SunWest Fruit Company has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1\tSUNWEST FRUIT COMPANY, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that SunWest Fruit Company has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nP1 South System (Old) | Ammonia | 25,000 lb\r\nP2 West System (New) | Ammonia | 20,000 lb\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n\r\n1.\tPrepared a u"

The facility has two (2)  ammonia systems. The South System provides refrigeration capacity to:\r\nHydrocooler 1 & 2\r\nBin Room\r\nStorage Room 1 - 3\r\nPrecool Room A\r\nPrecool Room B\r\nHallway\r\n\r\nThe West System provides refrigeration capacity to:\r\nNewmark Room A-D\r\nNewmark Room 4\r\n(10) Conditioning Rooms\r\nLoading Dock\r\n \r\nThe South System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia evaporates to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there the gas is piped to the compressors.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our receiver. The compressors are cooled by liquid injection oil cooling.\r\n\r\nThe West System operates as follows: control pressure liquid from the control pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.

As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia evaporates to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there the gas is piped to the compressors.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the control pressure receiver.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the control pressure receiver. High pressure liquid from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action. \r\n\r\nThe systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  \r\n \r\nEach ammonia system at SunWest Fruit Company consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating each system as a single process. \r\n\r\n1.3\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\n1.3.1\tGENERAL \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of an"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.4\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5\tEMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n\u00bf\tFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\u00bf\tCalifornia Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\r\n\u00bf\tFederal Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, SunWest Fruit Company continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that SunWest Fruit Company's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSunWest Fruit Company has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, SunWest Fruit Company has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of California Controlled Atmosphere's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\n\r\nFor the future, SunWest Fruit Company now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for SunWest Fruit Company employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program SunWest Fruit Company will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
