Elements of the RMP include the information listed below.\n\nI. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Prevention Program is an integral part of the RMP and shall be maintained and revised as necessary under the guidance of the Water Treatment Plant Manager.  The MSUD WTP maintains a complete written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that encompasses emergency response training for all covered processes that can effectively minimize the impact of an accidental release by ensuring proper and quick facility response. The prevention program is based on an involved management system that includes an employee participation plan, process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractor safety, pre-startup review, mechanical integrity, hot work permitting, management of change, incident investigation and compliance audit procedures.  The EAP will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to reflect changing conditions and ensure that it complies with EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP regulations.  \n\nII. FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Madison Suburban Utility District operates a water treatment plant that utilizes chlorine in the disinfection process.  The Plant Manager and Operators are Grade IV Water Treatment Plant Operators certified by the State of Tennessee.  The amount of chlorine stored on-site is above the threshold amount and meets the criteria for a Program 3 level requiring the development of a RMP.\n\nIII. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe MSUD WTP has also completed a Process Safety Manual (PSM) per OSHA requirement 29 CFR 1910. Elements of this program are combined with elements of the RMP.  Procedures have been developed specifically for the management of chlorine, which is the only re"

Other preventative procedures include housing the chlorine in an enclosed building equipped with automatic vents, automatic exhaust fans, an alarm system and an emergency shutoff system.\n\nIV. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents at the MSUD WTP facility in the last five years.\n\nV. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe EAP includes written safety procedures, emergency response procedures and includes the procedure for notifying the public and other affected agencies of an emergency. The WTP coordinates its EAP with the local agency of emergency management.  Annual class training, an on-site safety committee and the use of Material Safety Data Sheets keep employees aware of the hazards and safe use of chlorine. The EAP is available for review at the MSUD office.  \n \nVI. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe MSUD WTP is continually training its employees and looking for new equipment or technology that will improve safety at the facility for its employees and surrounding community."
