      "SummaryText": "The City of Midland, Texas (City) operates the Paul Davis Well Field disinfection facility (Paul Davis Well Field or Facility).  The City of Midland's Paul Davis Well Field disinfection facility is located at 4227 Highway 349 in Tarzan, Martin County, Texas.  The Facility disinfects well water prior to distribution to rural customers and prior to use as supplemental water at the City's Water Purification Plant (WPP).  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the Facility.  Up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Paul Davis Well Field.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Paul Davis Well Field is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c); ?68.155(b)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Assistant Utilities Director is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with o"

Certified operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Paul Davis Well Field has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a); ?68.155(d)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58; ?68.155(f)).  Currently, there are no planned changes to improve safety at the Facility (?68.155(f)). \n\n\n\nThe Paul Davis Well Field complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Paul Davis Well Field is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Facility is included in the Martin County's and the City of Midland's Emergency Response Plans.  The Facility operators are trained to notify Martin County dispatch via 9-1-1 in the event of a \"man down\" and to notify their supervisor in the event of suspected release.  The Plant Superintendent will notify 9-1-1 in the event of a verified release from the Facility.  The Martin County dispatch contacts the nearest first responders (the Martin County Volunteer Fire Department and the City of Midland) who coordinate the emergency response according to the applicable Emergency Response Plan, in"
