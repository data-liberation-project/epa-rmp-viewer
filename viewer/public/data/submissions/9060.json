Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles chlorine and aqua ammonia, which are considered hazardous materials.  The properties of both materials make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine and aqua ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe chlorine gas is used to disinfect water treated at the FWTP; to disinfect water pumped from the associated wells into the City's water distribution system, and to disinfect the water in the City's swimming pool.  Chlorine is delivered in one-ton containers for use at the FWTP, and in 150-lb cylinders for use at the wells, booster pump stations, and swimming pool.  All chlorine is delivered to the Chlorine Storage Area at the FWTP.  The one ton containers are used at this location, and the 150-lb cylinders (up to 15 at a time) are stored at this location and then transported to their various points of use.\n\nAqua ammonia, at 24.5 % strength, is used at the FWTP to aid in the disinfecting of treated water.  The aqua ammonia system consists generally of a steel storage tank, appurtenances; interconnecting buried piping, a metering pump, and pump discharge piping.  There is no detection system for ammonia.  Monitoring and control of the system is manual.  \n\nThe aqua ammonia at 24.5 % by weight is injected into the water at several points in the treatment process by a diaphragm-metering pump.  The metering pump stroke length is adjusted manually.  The pulse rate is adjusted automa"

Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe one ton chlorine container is the largest vessel in the chlorine system located at the  Freshwater Treatment Plant, while a 150 pound cylinder is the largest chlorine vessel at the well sites and the City Pool.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the one ton chlorine container assumes that the full 2,000 pounds of chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 200 pounds per minute.  The Worst Case release scenario to be modeled for the 150 pound chlorine cylinder assumes that the full 150 lbs. of chlorine is released over a ten minute period resulting in a release rate of 15 pounds per minute.  The distance to the endpoint of  .0087 mg/l for the Worst Case scenario is 1.3 miles.  This chlorine release will extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\nThe bulk aqua ammonia tank is the largest vessel in the aqua ammonia system with a fill capacity of 5, 000 gallons, or 37,400 pounds.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of chlorine or aqua ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Tracy Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.
