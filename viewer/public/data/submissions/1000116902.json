Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\nThe Coop board, management and employees at Central Farm Service (CFS), 77 Cedar Street, Easton, MN location, are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients. The facility has one 18,000 gallon storage tank and two 30,000 gallon storage tanks for a maximum quantity of BULK ammonia storage of approximately 363,776 pounds. The two 30,000 gallon tanks are manifolded. A second 18,000 gallon tank is on site but not in use. There are approximately 175,825 pounds of additional storage available in 1,000 and 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\nThere are zero (0) dedicated employees at the facility. Up to 10 employees may work on the site periodically throughout the year.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed mainten"

The Five-year Accident History:\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years on site that have:\na.\tCaused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or\nb.\tTo our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n5. Release Scenarios\na.\tWorst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario is a release of the entire contents from the largest storage vessel (30,000 gallons, 279,828 pounds) over a 10-minute timeframe. EPA\u0092s RMP Comp was used to model the release. The following assumptions were used for the model: wind speed 1.5 meters/second and atmospheric stability class F ( both are default assumptions per https://www.epa.gov/rmp/atmospheric-conditions-used-site-consequence-analyses) and a rural setting. Modeled results indicate potential impact radius of 9.7 miles, in which there is an estimated population of 5,007 people, schools, residences, recreational areas, and commercial, office, and/or industrial areas.\n\nb.\tAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario is a release caused by an onsite vehicular accident that ruptures a 1-inch diameter product pipe. Gas is released for 2 minutes at a rate of 2,500 lbs/minute, or 5,000 pounds. EPA\u0092s RMP Comp was used to model the release. The following assumptions were used for the model: wind speed 3 meters/second and atmospheric stability class D (both are default assumptions per https://www.epa.gov/rmp/atmospheric-conditions-used-site-consequence-analyses), and a rural setting. Modeled results indicate potential impact radius of 0.9 miles, in which there is an estimated population of 204 people, residences, and commercial, office, and/or industrial areas.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:\nThe facility has:\na.\tA written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 40 CFR 68.95. The plan incl"
