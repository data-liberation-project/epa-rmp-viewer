The facility has 3 rail towers and 2 truck racks utilized for these operations.  The product handled at this facility is Propane.  The facility has 18 propane storage tanks utilized to receive and store propane until the material is reloaded into railcars or trasnport trucks.   \n\nThe Rocklin Terminal is equipped with an Emergency Shutdown System which is designed to place the facility in a safe condition as quickly as possible in order to minimize the possibility of a catastrophic occurrence.  The Emergency Shutdown System blocks gas from entering the area by closing pneumatically operated block valves and de-energizes all compressors and pumps.\n\nSix (6) ESD Red Pushbutton stations are located at the following locations;\n\n1.    Next to the operatorA?s desk inside the shop area\n2.    At the rear entrance gate next to the operation control panel\n3.    At CompressorsA? 1 & 2 manifolds\n4.

The deluge systemA?s water is supplied by the Municipal Water System. \nThe deluge system can be activated either automatically or manually. Automatic activation o"

A Main Rail Tower ESD station is located at the rear entrance gate next to the operation control panel and when activated will shutdown all rail tower operations.\n\nAll of the previously mentioned tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 85% of their capacity.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals/flammables that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nPropane is the product handled at the Enterprise Rocklin Terminal and Storage which is the only flammable substance that is maintained in a quantity above the EPAA?s threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.115.

The macimum inventories of all six tanks was used due to the fact that all of the valves on these individual banks are normally open and tied into a single header to facilitate product and vapor recovery return flows that result from the terminal operations.  This scenario assumes there would be no mitigation.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the public would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation and the specifics of the simulation are available in the specified reporting data elements of the Risk Management Plan registration.\n \nAlternate Case Scenario : Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply pipe to the loading docks resulting in a ten minute release and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of emergency shutdown valves, pull-away shutdown system, and location operator attendance during product transfers.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility within the time frame selected.

Another copy of the Plan has been filed with the Placer County Environmental Health Department.  The emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source of fuel from a safe location or activate one of the shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1, evacuate personnel and secure the area.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.
