(EPS) personnel in the City of Commerce, California take great pride in maintaining a safe operation for the employees, the community, and the environment.  The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize the size of any release that does occur and contain it in as small as area as possible.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  It is EPS's policy to operate its plants in a manner that protect its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The EPS City of Commerce, California facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  The EPS City of Commerce, California facility manufactures water-based and solvent-based coatings and resins for numerous applications.  The Latex Resin Manufacturing process uses vinyl acetate (VA) as a raw material.  The facility stores VA in an 8,000-gallon storage tank.  The storage tank is surrounded by a secondary containment structure.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  The City of Commerce, California facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.  The facility uses both procedural as well as technological systems to ensure safe handling of VA.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The EPS City of Commerce, California plant has never had an accident i"
