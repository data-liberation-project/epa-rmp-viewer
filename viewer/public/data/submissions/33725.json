Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department Lee County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment. \n\n2) Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose..  \n\n3)  The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release Scenario\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n4)  The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5)  The Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; nor to our knowledge, have any accidental releases resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n6)  The Emergency Response Program:  The"

Our emergency  action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\nIf a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n7)  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvements is an on-going process at the faciltiy.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
