(Evans Harvey) are committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our accidental release prevention program which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Evans Harvey facility's primary activity is repackaging chemicals. Evans Harvey either repackages or warehouses 7 RMP-regulated substances at our facility.  Evans Harvey receives the regulated substances primarily in bulk and packages the products for customer distribution.  Drummed products are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  The inventories of RMP-regulated substances at the facility are dependent upon customer orders, and not all regulated substances are present on site at a given time.  The following summarizes (1) the RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances that may exceed the RMP threshold quantity at the facility, (2) the Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers associated with the regulated substance, and (3) the maximum quantities of RMP-regulated substances that may be at the facility:\n\nRMP Toxic Substances     CAS No.      Maximum Quantity (pounds)\n\nCyclohexylamine               108-91-8     470,000\nAcrylonitrile                       107-13-1     86,000\n\nRMP Flammable Substances\n\nIsopropylamine                  75-31-0       560,000\nTrimethylamine                 "

The RMP regulated process at the Evans Harvey facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the RMP rule.  The Program Level 3 requirements apply because the worst-case scenario for the process reaches nearby public receptors (e.g., industrial neighbors)  and the process is subject to OSHA?s process safety management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).\n\nThe RMP rule requires that an offsite consequence analysis be performed for hypothetical releases of RMP-regulated substances at the facility.  For Program 3 processes, the RMP rule requires that one worst-case release scenario be presented in the risk management plan for each hazard class (i.e., one toxic scenario and one flammable scenario).  The RMP rule also requires that more likely release scenarios, referred to as alternative release scenarios, be presented in the risk management plan.  One alternative release scenario must be presented for each RMP-regulated toxic substance at the facility, and one alternative release scenario must be presented for the RMP-regulated flammable substances collectively.\n\nIn performing the offsite consequence analysis of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, Evans Harvey used EPA's RMP*Comp software.  RMP*Comp is based on the look-up tables and equations provided in EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.\"\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, the worst-case scenario is a release of 195,000 pounds of liquid cyclohexylamine from a railcar.  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool that is comp"

The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammable substances, the worst-case scenario is a release of 160,000 pounds of isopropylamine from a railcar.  The released material ignites, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The pressure wave resulting from the explosion is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the RMP-regulated toxic substances, an alternative release scenario is required to be presented in the risk management plan for cyclohexylamine and acrylonitrile.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for cyclohexylamine is an unloading hose failure that releases 3,900 pounds of liquid over a 10-minute period (the time required for the operators to isolate the release).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool that is completely contained within a diked area.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for acrylonitrile is a release of 180 pounds of liquid from a drum over a 5-minute period (the time required for the operator to orient the drum to stop the leak).  The released liquid forms an evaporating pool inside the warehouse building.  The toxic vapor cloud generated by the evaporating pool is expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nFor the RMP-regulated flammable substances, only one alternative release scenario is required to be reported in the risk management plan.  A spill of 610 pounds (two drums) of isopropylamine is selected as the alternative release scenario.  The liquid pool formed by the release ignites, resulting in a pool fire.  The thermal radiation generated by the pool fire is not expected to reach offsite locations.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEvans Harvey has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements "

The repackaging and warehouse processes at our facility are subject to OSHA?s PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119),  and Evans Harvey is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEvans Harvey maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The checklist method is used to carry out our process hazard analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of personnel with experience in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis or when there is a change in the process.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Evans Harvey maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nEvans Harvey has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes.  New employees receive training and are tested for competency before starting work.
