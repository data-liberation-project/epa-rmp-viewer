During the last five years there have been no releases.\n\nThis is due impart to there accidental release prevention program and other safety measures that are all part of their ongoing everyday operations. Accidents are prevented by our being pro-active to safety regulations and practices. It is Garelick's policy to constantly re-examine our operations and improve emergency response and accident prevention programs. \n\nWe prevent accidents by designing for safety. By having alarms and interlocks that provide multiple lines of safety; automatic shutdown devices for major equipment to reduce duration and quantity of an accidental release; fire protection; independent and redundant backup systems for critical safety processes to ensure reliability of safety systems; piping built and maintained per high-integrity piping design codes; quality assurance of critical equipment to ensure fabrication to design specifications. \n\nMaintenance of our plant is done 24 hours a day. Specially qualified personnel routinely inspect, test, and maintain all equipment, including valves, pumps, seals, and tanks to ensure proper operation and mechanical integrity. In addition to regular maintenance operations, preventative maintenance (PM) is in place with all of our critical equipment with designated schedules. \n\nWe operate safely by our staff being trained in startup, shutdown, operation and maintenance of all equipment. Some maintenance activities require internal permitting to ensure work is done safely for protection of our employees, property, environment, and community. \n\nOur inventories are managed to minimize risk and to maintain minimum quantities consistent with manufacturing needs. Audits and inspections are done routinely. Appropriate regulatory permits are obtained and maintained. There are complete investigations of all accidents and incidents. \n\nAdministrativ"
