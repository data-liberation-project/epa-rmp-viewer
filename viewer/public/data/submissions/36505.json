Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan of Tonawanda 3M .  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 92 percent, and releases to water 84 percent. \n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our best efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Town of Tonawanda Fire Department and/or Brighton Hazmat  emergency response organization arrives. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n \n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe manufacture cellulose sponges at a facility located on a 19-acre site within an industrial zoned area of Tonawanda, New York.  The Approximately 27,000 square foot plant includes manufacturing, converting and warehouse facilities and employs approximately 400 people. We use one regulated substance at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in worki"

Viscose is used in the production of cellulose sponges.\n\n4. Tonawanda 3M Program to Prevent Accidental Releases \n\nAt  Tonawanda 3M, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\nWe have programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right To Know regulations.\nBeyond government requirements, we have our own standards for continuously improving safety at our plant.  Additional mitigation measures we have in place but did not take credit for in our alternative case scenario are: - a water filled dike system (the CS2 is heavier than water), a water deludge system, a sprinkler system, a relief panel, an enclosure, check valves, a manual shutoff system, an automatic shutoff system, alarms, sumps, a video camera monitoring system, procedures, and grounding system.\nFollowing is a brief description of the steps we take to prevent accidental releases:\n\u00b7 Process Safety Information - At Tonawanda 3M, we maintain a record of safety information that helps us conduct our operations safely. This information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with appropriate processes. The information is used in process training for employees and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. The information is reviewed for any appropriate improvements\n\u00b7 Process Hazard Analysis - With the support of 3M corporate specialists, we conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with certain hazardous processes are identified and controlled ef"

These studies are revalidated at regular intervals of no more than five years or whenever significant changes are made in affected operations. Findings from the hazard analysis are presented so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.\n\u00b7 Operating Procedures - To conduct our manufacturing processes safely, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. \n\u00b7 Training - At Tonawanda 3M, we have a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating hazardous processes understand and are well trained in the correct operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided. \n\u00b7 Mechanical Integrity - We conduct and document in detail maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are conducted by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices or other specialized subjects as needed.  Equipment deficiencies are identified so that they can be corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\u00b7 Management of Change - We have established written procedures at Tonawanda 3M to manage changes in process materials, technology, equipment and procedures.

Further, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response. \nTonawanda 3M participates in the Local Emergency Preparedness Committee, the Hazardous Material Advisory Council and the Community Advisory Panel.\n\n7. Changes to Improve Safety\nAt Tonawanda 3M, we strive to continually improve safety at the plant.  Our efforts range from designing safety into our manufacturing operations to regular assessments identifying opportunities for safety improvements.  Important new elements in Tonawanda 3M's continuous improvement program is to install additional innovative pollution-control equipment to reduce air emissions.  Changes were made to improve the Deludge system coverage of the CS2 Storage tank.  In addition changes are being made to: Grounding system, Float used to maintain the water blanket and the elimination of heating tape where possible and the PLC logic to monitor the unload flow rate.\nIn addition, Tonawanda 3M has implemented an updated corporate policy to make safety a part of every employee's responsibility.  This policy encourages employees to identify any situations they perceive to be unsafe, as well as any opportunities to improve safety.
