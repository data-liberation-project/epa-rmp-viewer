      "SummaryText": "The City of Kannapolis owns a water treatment plant at 1303 Pump Station Road in Kannapolis, North Carolina, Rowan County.  This water treatment is operated by Pillowtex/Fieldcrest Cannon located at One Lake Circle Drive in Kannapolis, North Carolina.  The City of Kannapolis Water Treatment plant employees approximately xxx persons from the surrounding community.\n\nThe City of Kannapolis Water Treatment plant can store a maximum of six (6) two-ton cylinders of chlorine.  The chlorine is subject to Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 requirements, as well as, Process Safety Management, 29 CFR 1910.119 requirements.  In addition, to maintaining these programe, the corporate Pillowtex/Fieldcrest Cannon office consists of a Risk Management division which conducts annual audits of all facilities to ensure that all processes are being operated safely.\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for chlorine is the release of the entire contents of the largest cylinder (2,000 lbs) due to rupture.  Using EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and verified by using the RMP CompTM Program, the maximum distance to the endpoint was determined to be 3.0 miles for rural terrain. \n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" for chlorine is assumed to be a release through the fusable plug (0.75 inch hole).  Using EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants and verified by using the RMP CompTM Program, the release rate is calculated to be 1,380 lbs/min with a maximum impact distance of 1.6 miles terrain.\n\nThe City of Kannapolis Water Treatment Plant has worked to maintain a safe environment for their employees and the surrounding commuity.  The facility has has no chlorine incidents during the last five years.  \n\nThe facility has established an emergency response program detailing specific actions to be taken in the event of an incident involving chlorine.  The facility has trained its employees on response actions.  Response activities will be coordinated with the Kannapolis "
