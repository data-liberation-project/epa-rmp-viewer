Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since Elbow River purchased the terminal. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Hankinson Storage Terminal since Elbow River purchased the terminal or was reported under previous ownership and operation within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe terminal has developed an emergency response plan, which will be coordinated with local emergency response groups such as the Hankinson Fire Department. Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Richland County LEPC. The terminal operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The Emergency Response Plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nThe Mechanical"
