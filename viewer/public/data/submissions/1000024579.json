Facility Policy.\n\n\n\n   The owners, management and employees of Golden Furrow Fertilizer, Inc. are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the\n\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Keokuk Co. LEPC, and/or other authorities, to\n\nmitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   \n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product,\n\nanhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop\n\nproduction. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\n   An analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental\n\nreleases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management\n\nProgram.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\n   The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state\n\nregulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form;\n\nsee Section 8.3 (b).\n\n\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n   \n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\n\nany deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any\n\naccidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental\n\ndamage.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n   The facility has:\n\n\n\n   a. A written emerg"

If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility,\n\nthe required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and\n\ncall 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our\n\nEmergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n   \n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\n\nthe conditions at Golden Furrow Fertilizer, Inc. There are no additional specific safety recommendations\n\nregarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
