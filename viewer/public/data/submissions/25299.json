Bill Sirman (410-632-2398) operates the plant during the use season.\nI. Facility Policy\nThe owner, management and employees of UAP Northeast - Girdletree, MD are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release occurs, management is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\nII. Facility Information\nThe only activity at this facility on Queponco Road - Newark, MD is the storage and dispensing, and sale of anhydrous ammonia to local farmers as a nitrogen fertilizer nutrient.\nThe maximum quantity stored in the 30,000 gallon tank is 132,000 pounds. (85% of storage tank size)\nFarmer customers bring their 1,000 gallon nurse tanks to the facility to be filled and then take them immediately back to their farm.\nIII. Scenario for the \"Worst Case Release\"\nThe worst case release would be release of the total contents of the 30,000 gal. Tank over a 10 minute period. This maximum quantity would be the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.43 miles.\nIV. Scenario for the \"Alternative Release\"\nAn alternative release scenario is based on a release from a broken 2 inch transfer hose. It is assumed that the release is manually shut off at 2 minutes duration. In this case the distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.14 miles.\nV. Accidental Release and Prevention Program\nThe facility operates under accepted anhydrous ammonia industry standards for storage and handling.\nVI. Five Year Accident History\nThis facility was put into service in April 2001 and has no history of any accidents.\nVII. Emergency Response Plan\nIn the case of an u"

UAP Northeast is working with local authorities to be included in the community Emergency Response Plan.\nVIII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions and evaluate employee training. UAP Northeast is planning to install perimeter fencing in the near future."
