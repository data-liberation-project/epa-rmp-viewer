However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Station is located approximately 0.5 miles north of Wamsutter, WY on East Carlton Road.  The plant is designed to process 275 MMSCFD of natural gas.  The natural gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbon liquids are removed, stored in atmospheric tanks and sold as condensate.  The plant process is idled when liquid hydrocarbon content in the feed gas is low enough that processing is not necessary but is always maintained and ready for immediate resumption of operation..  Design liquid production is approximately 120 BPD, but actual production rates have seldom been that high.  The plant has gas compression, dehydration, and utilizes a propane refrigeration process for hydrocarbon liquid recovery.  The plant contains propane (which is used as the refrigerant), mixed hydrocarbon liquids in the process, and natural gas which are all regulated flammables.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:\nThis facility was built in accordance with the appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements fo the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\nChemical-specfic steps Include:\n1.  Hydrocarbon Detectors;\n2.  Process Safety Relief Valves;\n3.  Automated Plant Shutdown System.  The plant will be automatically shutdown should key proces"

Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires;\n6.  Back-up generator to keep controls powered during a power failure.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Station was initially started in 2000.  The station has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site and no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Lost Creek Compressor Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Sweetwater County LEPC.  The Emergency Response Plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or station facilities are currently planned."
