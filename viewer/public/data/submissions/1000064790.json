Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex\n\n\n\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster complex. The complex is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\n\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention and training.   This complex has an extensive operator and maintenance training program which has resulted in skilled operators who know the process, equipment and roles and responsibilities in day to day operations as well as emergency operations.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, APC will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan at this complex includes:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment to determine the types of hazards that exist at the facilities and the potential consequences of an accidental release.  \n\n2.  Development of prevention programs to allow safe operation of the equipment, this includes operational procedures, training and preventative maintenance of all equipment associated with the processes.\n\n3.  Development of an emergency response plan to help properly trained operations personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from the covered processes.\n\n\n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Complex is located in Weld County about three (3) miles east of Highway 85 on WCR 22 and consists of the Fort Lupton compressor station on the"

      "SummaryText": " south side of WCR 22 and the Platte Valley gas plant which is located at the same address on the north side of WCR 22.  This complex is located in a rural area which is used primarily for farming. \n\n\n\nThe Complex consists of the Ft. Lupton gas plant, which is made up of two compression systems (high and low) and a refrigeration recovery plant.  There are 6 high pressure units with discharge pressure not to exceed 1,220 psig.  The high pressure throughput is 120 MMCF/D.  The high pressure discharge flows through glycol dehydration and is discharged to delivery points via 12\" and 20\" cleanable pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe low pressure system consists of 3 units whose discharge pressure of the low pressure system does not exceed 280 psig.  The low pressure throughput is 80 MMCF/D.  Gas is discharged via the 24\" cleanable pipeline to the high pressure compressor at the station for recompression.  The station is equipped with liquid separation.  \n\n\n\nThe purpose of  this portion of the complex is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that should be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\n\n\nThe gas is then compressed which causes some of the heavy hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw, natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into either a tank truck for transportation or pumped into a liquids pipeline.\n\n\n\nAfter"

      "SummaryText": " compression, the gas is subjected to a liquid desiccant, Tri-ethylene glycol (TEG), to further remove water.  The glycol is regenerated and used again in a continuous closed loop system.\n\n\n\nThe Platte Valley Plant which is contiguous to the Ft. Lupton Compressor station and makes up part of the complex is designed to process 90 mmscf/d of natural gas and recover natural gas liquids from that gas using a cryogenic process.  After processing, the gas, which consists primarily of methane, is sold to two outlet pipelines that cross the plant boundary.  The natural gas liquids are treated to remove any CO2 and then either sold down a liquids pipeline or fractionated into separate components and stored in pressurized storage before being sold into trucks as propane, butane and/or gasoline.  \n\n\n\nThe third plant that makes up the complex is the Lancaster plant which is located just east of the Ft. Lupton plant.  This plant is a cryogenic plant which recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) from the raw field gas that enters the plant at high pressure.  These liquids are sold down a liquids pipeline.  There is no NGL storage associated with Lancaster.  All natural gas is sold to the two pipelines that pass by the plant.\n\n\n\nThe total storage capacity between the three facilities exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for these components and therefore the complex is subject to the requirements in the EPA Risk Management plan.  \n\n\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\n\n\nThe Fort Lupton Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's.  HS Resources purchased the facilities from Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in December of 1999.  KN Energy operated the system from April 1993 through December 1, 1999. Kerr McGee (KMG) acquired HS Resources in August, 2001. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation acquired Kerr McGee in the fall of 2006. The additional compressors were installed in the early 2000s by HS Resources and KMG.  The Platte Valley Plant which is contiguous with t"

Together these three form the Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex.\n\n\n\nProgram Level\n\n\n\nAPC has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Ft. Lupton/Platte Valley/Lancaster Complex.  The Off Site Consequence Analysis reveals that there are no \"public receptors\" within the calculated 0.5 mile 1.0 psi overpressure endpoint for the worst-case scenario.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Complex is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written emergency response program which has been developed in accordance with OSHA PSM Requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs and post incident cleanup. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents that meet the criterion for inclusion in this submittal.\n\n"
