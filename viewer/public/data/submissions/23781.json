EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef, L.P (Farmland National Beef) owns and operates a meat cutting and tray packaging facility in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania.  On site, Farmland National Beef has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated hazardous substance, for the refrigeration of meat at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is above the threshold quantity listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68.130.\n\n\n\nSince the quantity of anhydrous ammonia exceeds the threshold quantity, Farmland National Beef is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) at the Hummels Wharf facility which includes three (3) major elements: hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response program.  The submission of the RMPlan presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by Farmland National Beef.  The required RMP information was electronically submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process.\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Based on the information presented in this program, Farmland National Beef is subject to Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef is committed to the protection of the safety, health, and environment in our routine operations and emergency responses.  Our prevention and emergency response practices are developed to protect the public as well as our own employees.  It is our policy to comply with applicable laws, and to support and work with local emergency response agencies.  To implement this policy, the following plans are maintained and implemented at the Hummels "

Hummels Wharf, PA plant located at 301 Old Trail Road and Elm Street is a meat cutting and tray pack plant.  Fresh meat in large cuts is cut into consumer portions and packaged in consumer trays.  No slaughtering takes place at the plant and no live animals are received.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides the necessary refrigeration of the meat.  In addition, the ammonia refrigeration system is utilized to provide cooling for the plant itself.  There are approximately 31,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia located within the closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\n1.3 Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nSection 68.25 of the RMP Regulation defines a worst-case scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\n\n\n\nAt Farmland National Beef, the worst-case scenario is identified to be the release of anhydrous ammonia from the largest vessel containing anhydrous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia receiver is the largest ammonia vessel at the facility.  As an administrative control, the receiver is filled with anhydrous ammonia only to a maximum of fifty (50) percent (8,324 lbs of anhydrous ammonia) of its capacity.  The largest vessel is assumed to instantaneously release its entire contents in a worst-case accidental release scenario.  The anhydrous ammonia will then volatilize into the atmosphere.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's offsite consequence analysis program RMP*Comp(tm) and shows that the toxic end"

      "SummaryText": "point may reach a distance of 1.1 miles. This release would affect public and environmental receptors.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the rupture of a 2 1/2\" High Pressure Liquid ammonia line which feeds ammonia to the high pressure accumulator.  This failure will conservatively assume that 4,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia will be released to the atmosphere in ten minutes.  Modeling of this release was performed using the EPA's offsite consequence analysis program RMP*Comp(tm) and shows that the toxic endpoint may reach a distance of 0.2 miles.  This release would affect public receptors.\n\n\n\nIn general, mitigation procedures in place at the Hummels Wharf facility include a sump below the anhydrous ammonia receiver with a manually operated pump and shutoff valves to isolate any line or vessel in case of an accidental release.\n\n\n\n1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef has specific process controls in-place to minimize the risks of spills. Farmland National Beef has a preventative maintenance program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All inspection and testing procedures are addressed within this program.  In addition, there are many safety controls installed within the system.  These include an interlock system, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms located within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.5 Five year Accident History\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef, L.P. opened this plant in May 2001.  Operations by the prior owner of the property ceased in 1992.  Farmland National Beef, L.P. does not have actual knowledge of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the past five years.\n\n\n\n1.6 The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nFarmland National Beef's emergency response policies summarize the actions to be taken in response to a chemical spill.  In the event of a spill, Farmland Nationa"

Farmland National Beef is committed to continuously improving the facility's safety and working practices through employee involvement and development.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Assessment (PHA) was recently performed at the Farmland National Beef facility.  A number of safeguards identified during that PHA are being implemented to improve the safety of the anhydrous ammonia process as well as reduce the chances and magnitude of any anhydrous ammonia spill.\n\n"
