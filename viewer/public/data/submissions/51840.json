In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.

Our Process Safety Management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention program, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-Startup Safety Review - PSSR\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs a part of the prevention efforts, there are a multitude of programs in which Enterprise employees participate.  A training program has been developed in which Operations and Maintenance personnel are specifically trained in the operation of the facility, the operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and specific other regulations and policies, as well as in all areas of emergency response.  Employees are trained on, use, and apply the guidelines of our PSM program, which include all of the above-listed areas.

The Kutz storage tank is a single 63,000 gallon capacity tank that receives mixed NGL from the transport truck unloading docks.

The tank level is administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of its capacity.\n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\nFlammables\n\nMixed NGL is received from transport trucks and is delivered into the storage tank.  This material from the tank is pumped into the mixed NGL product pipeline for distribution.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\n\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Hobbs Terminal.\n\nWorse Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the storage tank resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.

This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 20,016 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.
