Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at the Houston Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacture.  We have 14 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer), Propionitrile, Methyl Mercaptan, Ethyl Mercaptan [Ethanethiol], Acetaldehyde, Allyl Alcohol, Propylene Oxide, Trimethylamine [Methanamine, N,N-dimethyl-], Hydrogen Chloride (anhydrous) and Sulfur trioxide.

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp Program V1.07.  We used Land View V to calculate the population.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Sulfur Dioxide Unit of Sulfur Dioxide.  In this scenario 300,000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide  is released from a storage tank.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Trimethylamine.  In this scenario, 32,200 lb of Trimethylamine is released which represents one 46,000 lb truck with 70% Trimethylamine.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor at a release rate to outside air of 282 lb/min, which finds an ignition source and creates a vapor cloud explosion .

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHouston Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP (Hazard and Operability),  Fault Tree and LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/13/2003.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Houston Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nThe Houston Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Houston Plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 11/15/2003.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Houston Plant.  The most recent review was performed on 10/21/2003.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Houston Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11/20/2003.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe Houston Plant promptly investigates any incident that has re"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe Houston Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Houston Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nRhodia, Houston Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only six accidental releases have occurred during this period.\n\nThere have been six accidental releases of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.
