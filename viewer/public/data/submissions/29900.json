If an emergency were to occur, it is the facilities policy to notify the Lehigh County LEPC as well as the Lower Macungie Fire Department #30, as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Lehigh County LEPC, Macungie Ambulance Corps and Lehigh Valley Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade but does employ a hazardous materials response team on-site to respond to small or the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P.- Macungie Station is a pipeline breakout station, including butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane blending systems only, including the associated piping and six (6) 60,000-gallon storage tanks.\n\nThis facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the blending systems six (6) 60,000-gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (92% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends off-site 1 mile and includes public and environmental receptors.  The facilities alternate (most likely) release scenario is a pull away accident resulting in a one minute pipe/hose release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint (1 PSI overpressure) extends to 0.02 miles but does not effect residential areas.\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company L.P.- Macungie Station complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
