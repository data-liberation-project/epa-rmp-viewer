Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Famous Vineyards has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Famous Vineyards, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Famous Vineyards has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nP1 Old Cold Storage          Anhydrous Ammonia       20,000\nP2 New Cold Storage        Anhydrous Ammonia       120,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The Grape Repack Line is equipped with air-cooling evaporators as required for direct-expansion.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within, directly above, or outside the respective machinery rooms.\n \nProcess Classification\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Famous Vineyards consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are neither interconnected nor co-located relative to each other. As such, the refrigeration systems at Famous Vineyards are treated as two (2) independent processes.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nFamous Vineyards has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration processes. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Famous Vineyards facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigera"

This has improved Famous Vineyards' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Famous Vineyards' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nFamous Vineyards has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Famous Vineyards has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Famous Vineyards now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Famous Vineyards employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Famous Vineyards will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
