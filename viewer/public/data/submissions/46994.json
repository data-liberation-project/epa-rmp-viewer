The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nPoolman maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nStartup of the company occurred in 1964.  The facility was previously located at 1444 North 26th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85009.  The new facility, which started operation March 1, 2000, is located at 3242 South Central Avenue, Phoenix, AZ 85040.  The chlorine transfer process for Poolman consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder which is used off site to treat private swimming pools. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 9,850 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPoolman has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\nThere are only three trained operators responsible for transferring the chlorine from one ton containers to the 20 pound transfer cylinders.  These operators are OSHA First Responder - Incident Commander Level trained to respond to a release of chlorine.  The facility has regular training exercises with the local Fire Department as well as Hill Brothers Chemical, the delivery vendor.  \n\nChlorine in the pipeline is bled to a scrubber and there is a 3-point chlorine detection system with three sensors located in the storage area that will alarm and alert the office in the event of a chlorine release.  In addition, there is a horn that can be heard throught the property as well as a security system that will contact listed responders during off-hours in the event of a release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past 5 years (3/1/2000 to 3/1/2005) there have been no releases of chlorine at the facility.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPoolman has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  The facility has three trained operators that can assist the Fire Department in the event of a release of chlorine.  These three individuals are OSHA certified Incident Commanders which requires 40 hours of First Responder training by a certified trainer and 8 hours of annual refresher training to maintain the certification. Poolman has periodic drills with the local Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPoolman is planning to implement several items, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safet"
