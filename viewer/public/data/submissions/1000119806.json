Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\nFederal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\nCalifornia Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\nFederal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Fresh Select has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1 Fresh Select, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Fresh Select has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nProcess Name                | Process Chemical             | Process Quantity(lbs.)\nAmmonia Refrigeration         Anhydrous Ammonia              18,000\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n2. Organized the p"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n1.2.1 Facility Overview\nFresh Select operates a commercial cold storage for a variety of fruit in Dinuba, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n(4) Rooms\n(1) Loading Dock\n(4) Degreening Rooms (glycol)\n\n1.2.2 Facility Location\nFresh Select is located at 39303 Road 56 Dinuba, CA 93618. The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.504308, -119.450316. The facility is located approximately 5.5 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \u0093an area of minimal flood hazard\u0094.\nFresh Select is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Fresh Select had a 1-2% chance of experiencing \u0093potentially minor-damage\u0094 due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n1.2.3 Description of Covered Process\nRooms 1 and 4 are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and an accumulators as required for flooded operation. Rooms 2-3 and the loading dock are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and a liquid recirculator as required for a pumped overfeed operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room.\n\n1.2.5 Process Classification\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Fresh Select consists of vessels, equipment, a"

As such, the refrigeration system at Fresh Select is treated as a single process.\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n1.3.1 General \n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nFresh Select has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Fresh Select facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nFresh Select has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nFresh Select's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nCalifornia \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\nFederal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFresh Select has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Fresh Select continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Fresh Select's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Fresh Select's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nFresh Select has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Fresh Select has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Fresh Select now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Fresh Select employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Fresh Select will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
