Facility description and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe Jordan Valley Water Treatment Plant (JVWTP) is located at 15305 South 3200 West, Herriman, UT, and is owned and operated by Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District (District).  JVWTP is a conventional potable water treatment process utilizing coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection.  JVWTP uses chlorine gas for both pre- and post-disinfection as part of the treatment process.  Disinfection is required for all treated surface waters before being distributed for human consumption.\n\nLiquid chlorine is shipped to JVWTP in one-ton containers, and fed as a gas into the process.  JVWTP normally maintains a chlorine inventory of approximately 40,000 lbs with a maximum possible inventory of 46,000 lbs.  JVWTP is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the facility is equipped with appropriate chlorine detection, alarm, and scrubber systems.  All chlorine related equipment is routinely inspected and serviced.\n\n2.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe District has outlined a policy in an effort to protect the health and safety of employees and the public by minimizing the risk from exposure to hazardous chemicals.  All employees at the JVWTP are required to comply with the procedures outlined in the PSM/RMP Plan and Chemical Spill Emergency Response Plan.  Management has outlined their commitment to safety in Section 11.7 of the JVWCD Personnel Rules and Regulations Manual:\n\nA.     The personal safety and health of each District employee is of the highest importance.  The District is committed to maintaining an occupational injury-free and illness-free workplace in compliance with all applicable State and federal statutes and regulations.  To this end, the District will provide all the necessary safety equipment and provisions required for personal "

      "SummaryText": "safety and health.\n         \n3.    General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe quantity of chlorine stored at JVWTP exceeds the 2,500 lb threshold established by EPA, making JVWTP subject to Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  In addition, JVWTP is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations established by OSHA.  The RMP program is very similar to the prevention program required to comply with OSHA's PSM requirements.  The purpose of the PSM and RPM is to prevent a catastrophic release of chlorine, or to minimize the consequences should a release ever occur.  The program includes the following items specific to chlorine system: process safety information; a process hazard analysis; operation, maintenance, and training procedures; a review of mechanical integrity; procedures regarding visitors, contractors, and tours; changes to the process; and incident investigations.\n\nDocumentation of the management system defines the staffing and organization of JVWTP and states that the Treatment Department Manager has overall responsibility for the implementation of the RMP.  It also defines the delegation of responsibility for specific program elements.\n\nJVWTP personnel have conducted a hazard assessment of facilities, to determine potential risks.  In addition, JVWTP personnel regularly conduct operation and maintenance training, routinely inspect equipment, and regularly perform maintenance of chlorination facilities and equipment.\n\nJVWTP is equipped with a chlorine scrubber system designed to mitigate any release inside the chlorine room.\n\n\n4.    Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been zero reportable incidents resulting in major injury, death, or damage at JVWTP since construction of the facility including the 5 years preceding the date of this document.\n\n5.    Emergency response program:\n\nJVWTP maintains an emergency response plan which includes evacuation/shelter procedures, notification procedures, a"

The plan also includes updated personnel information for emergency response team members and outside agencies including their duties and responsibilities.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with Salt Lake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and other local fire departments.  Should there be a need for outside agency assistance, these agencies are  prepared to assist with any medical needs, traffic control, or evacuation/sheltering of the public which may be required.\n\nThe procedures and policies outlined regarding the chlorine process, emergency response, and training found in the PSM/RMP document are reviewed regularly.  All recommendations are evaluated, and those deemed necessary are implemented as soon as is reasonably possible.  This is to ensure the safest possible environment for JVWTP employees and the public.\n\nThe hazard assessment included a determination of the off-site consequences for both the worst-case and alternate-case leak scenarios.  The distance traveled by a release in these scenarios was determined by EPA's RMP Comp program.\n\n6.    Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nA new chlorine gas scrubber will be installed and fully functional by late 2011.  The existing chlorine gas scrubber uses old technology and requires a great deal of maintenance. The new scrubber will use a pellet media which simplifies maintenance and operations.  After the scrubber is installed, we plan to update the RMP to reflect these changes as well as to update the affected population based on the 2010 census.  We will also update the Hazards Assessment by using the latest modeling software and make appropriate changes to the off-site consequences of a chlorine release at the JVWTP.\n\n"
