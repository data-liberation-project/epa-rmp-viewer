Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe PPG Architectural Coatings Reading Distribution Center (DC) complies with applicable Pennsylvania, and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.\n\nPPG's EHS Policy incorporates the elements of several voluntary global industry initiatives, including Responsible Care; and Coatings Care, which help companies manage safe and environmentally responsible practices in the chemicals and coatings industries.  Employees at the Reading DC are trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling practices, and fork truck driving safety.  Central to PPG's focus on safety and the environment is its EHS Policy. The policy provides the guidelines under which PPG markets, distributes and manufactures products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\n\nII.    Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPPG Reading DC is part of the PPG Architectural Coatings business unit.  The Reading DC stores paint, stain, and related products and distributes them to dealers, stores, and home centers. Products are stored in various containers including aerosol spray cans.  Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutane, and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulation.  The aerosol products are stored in a separate storage room designed for this purpose.\n\nIII.    Worst-Case Scenario:\n\nWorst-case analysis consisted of a 1-lb release resulting in a vapor cloud of 0.01 miles (53ft). The flammable aerosols are stored within the facility in a designated storage area; therefore the vapor cloud would be contained within the facility walls.\n\nIV.    General Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  The PPG Reading DC complies with EPA RMP regulations for the safe storage of flammable aerosols. Under the RM"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThe PPG Reading DC began operating in 2002 Since operations began, there have been no accident related to the release of a regulated substance covered under the RMP regulations.\n\nVI.    Emergency Response Procedures:\n\nPPG Reading DC coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department. Additionally, the facility periodically reviews and trains employees on the written emergency response plant and evacuation procedures.\n\nVII.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPrevention programs utilized at the PPG Reading DC include a fire prevention plan, aerosol storage operating procedure, equipment inspections, fire suppression system, inventory and storage controls and employee training. These systems and safe guards are periodically assessed for effectiveness, at least every 5 years.\n\n\n\n"
