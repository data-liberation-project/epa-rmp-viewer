Employees at the Reading DC are trained in accident prevention, hazard communication, emergency response, safe material handling practices, and fork truck driving safety.  Central to PPG's focus on safety and the environment is its EHS Policy. The policy provides the guidelines under which PPG markets, distributes and manufactures products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers and the environment.\r\nII.\tRegulated Substances Handled\r\nPPG Reading DC is part of the PPG Architectural Coatings business unit.  The Reading DC stores paint, stain, and related products and distributes them to dealers, stores, and home centers. Products are stored in various containers including aerosol spray cans.  Some of the aerosols contain propane, butane, isobutane, and methyl ether, which are used as propellants.  These four materials are regulated flammable substances under the EPA RMP regulation.  The aerosol products are stored in a separate storage room designed for this purpose.\r\nIII.\tWorst-Case Scenario:\r\nWorst-case analysis consisted of a 1-lb release resulting in a vapor cloud of 0.01 miles (53ft). The flammable aerosols are stored within the facility in a designated storage area; therefore the vapor cloud would be contained within the facility walls.\r\nIV.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:  The PPG Reading DC complies with EPA RMP regulations for the safe storage of flammable aerosols.

Additionally, the facility periodically reviews and trains employees on the written emergency response plant and evacuation procedures.\r\nVII.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nPrevention programs utilized at the PPG Reading DC include a fire prevention plan, aerosol storage operating procedure, equipment inspections, fire suppression system, inventory and storage controls and employee training. These systems and safe guards are periodically assessed for effectiveness, at least every 5 years."
