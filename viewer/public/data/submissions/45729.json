      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  Our company handles two hazardous substances in amounts requiring special measures as stated in this summary. We have a training program for employees consisting of video tapes and on-hand demonstrations.  Each employee must demonstrate his/her knowledge of safety procedures prior to handling these hazardous substances.  Employees are tested for their knowledge throughout the year and are spot-checked on site.\nOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Our facility consists of one large metal building with retractable overhead doors at each end and separate heavy metal storage units located approximately 75 feet from the main facility.  A small metal office adjoins the main facility on the west side which is where all pedestrians enter, thereby keeping them from entering the main storage facility.  The only hazardous products handled in quantities large enough for regulation are chlorine gas and sulphur dioxide. \nHANDLING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS:  All hazardous materials are stored in containers and with appropriate placards as required by OSHA.  All procedures for handling the chemicals  meet or exceed government standards.  We also have the appropriate spill-containment kits within easy access for all trained employees.  We do not package or repackage hazardous chemicals and employees are forbidden to alter the containers in any manner in which the chemicals are received.\nTRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS:  All vehicles used for transport of hazardous chemicals are inspected and have been approved by the Department of Transporation.  All drivers are trained and instructed in the correct way to secure a load and correct placarding for the chemicals.  All drivers are drug-tested through an independent agent.\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  In case of accidental release of chlorine gas or sulphur dioxide, we have overpacks for containment of any cylinder which may be leaking, and all employees are "

      "SummaryText": "trained in the use of these overlays.  A) a leak while in transit would be treated with an overpack for containment, and the driver would immediately notify the closest authorities for hazardous materials.  The driver is equipped with a cell phone and list of telephone numbers for notification of proper officials. B) If a leak should occur at our faciltiy, specific rules would be followed simultaneously by our employees.  One employee would alert the proper authorities, the Wichita County HAZMAT team, while other employees would contain the leaking cylinder with the overpacks, and C) all employees would exit the premises to await the arrival of the HAZMAT team.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  We have never had a chemical release of any amount.  Extreme caution is used when dealing with hazardous chemicals and each cylinder is treated as a possible hazard.\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  We will remain abreast of all available safety measures, and as technology and control equipment improves, we will continue to maintain the newest equipment for hazardous materials containment."
