      "SummaryText": "This facility was built new in 2002 and 2003.  Ammonia was first charged into the system on May 21, 2003.  Wells, Inc. closed the facility and delisted the facility in 2014.  Dean Foods purchased the facility in December 2015 and plans to begin production in the 3rd quarter of 2016.  The ammonia refrigeration system will be charged later today (June 6, 2016).  This submission satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Plan triggered by the recharging and re-commissioning of the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nDean Foods has developed a Risk Management Program Plan (RMP) for the use and storage of ammonia in the industrial refrigeration system at the St. George Ice Cream Plant in St. George, Utah.  The RMP was established to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act Risk Management Program as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulation, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\r\nDean Foods utilizes the applicable elements of it's Process Safety Management (PSM) program (29 CFR 1910) to fulfill the requirements of the level 3 release prevention and other applicable portions of the RMP.  Process specific training is provided to maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the refrigeration system's mechanical integrity is maintained throughout the life of the process.  Administative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly.  The various facets of the RMP and PSM programs are linked through documentation and communication.\r\n\r\nWe have coordinated the Emergency Action Plan with the local Fire Department and Responders."
