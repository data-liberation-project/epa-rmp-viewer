The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Brady Grain, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by our farmer customers for their crop production nutrients.\n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 356,000 pounds in our 2 storage tanks, and 26      nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the contents of a semi-truck unloading 44,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 50,000              pounds, which represents the volume of a storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is .67 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions and the standards of the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammoni"
