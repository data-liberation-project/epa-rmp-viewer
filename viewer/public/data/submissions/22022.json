Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the enviroment.\n\n2. Facility Information \n\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of chemical and fertilizers for agricultural inputs.  This facility maintains thirty-eight 1000gallon nurse tanks, and three 1500gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 200200 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 30000 gallon and one 12,000 gallon storage tanks on site.  The maximim storage capacity of stationary storage tanks sis 196,000 pounds of ammonia.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is 396,200 pounds.  The largest storage vessel at our facility contains 140000 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case Scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 30,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting  in total vaporization.  The mazimum quanity released would be 140,000 pounds.  According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint (from point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have an off-site impact.  It should be noted that Triangle Agronomy Services has never had a release of an entire stationay storage tank at any of its distribution facilities.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\nThe most common alternativ release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-p"

      "SummaryText": "oint off-site.\nThe alternative release scenariomodeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a monual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (from point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have an off-site impact.  It should be noted that Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC has never had a release of this type from any of its distribution facilities.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia: The system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility coplies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989) OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local \ncodes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected form major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves.  The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails. All main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and /or according to the guidlines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at minimum annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  The training consists of classroom, lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training.\n\n5. Five Year Accicent History:\n\nThere has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that cause"

      "SummaryText": "d deaths, injuries, property or enviromental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\n6.The Emergency Response Program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinatd with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.   This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by an ammonia release.  This complies with the requirement for our facilitiy to be included in the community response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Triangle Agronomy Services, LLC has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each faciliyt that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200).  The plan includes public notification, provisions for intital medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
