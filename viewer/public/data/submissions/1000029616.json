(3F) is a global manufacturer and supplier of high quality chemical flocculants and coagulants used for water and waste water treatment, sludge draining and thickening, and other industrial applications.  Historically, 3F has purchased acrylamide from an external supplier for use in its manufacturing processes.  With the addition of the acrylamide manufacturing process, 3F will manufacture its own acrylamide.\n\n\n\nThis document includes a brief description of the Risk Management Program at 3F. The management at 3F is committed to ensuring chemical safety for its employees and the surrounding community through a comprehensive Risk Management Program that utilizes Process Hazard Analysis, process controls, employee training, emergency response procedures and operating procedures.\n\n1.1    Process Description\n\n\n\nThe addition of the acrylamide manufacturing process at 3F triggered the need for a Risk Management Program in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  Acrylamide is manufactured through hydrolysis of acrylonitrile, which is a regulated substance.  The 3F process includes an above ground acrylonitrile storage tank with a storage capacity of 50,000 gallons (336,500 pounds).  The 112(r) threshold quantity for acrylonitrile is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the site is 325998, \"All Other Miscellaneous Chemica"

This approach is a formal systematic critical examination of the process and engineering intentions of new or existing facilities to assess the hazard potential that arise from deviation in design specifications and the consequential effects on the facilities as a whole.  The consequences of the hazard and measures to reduce the frequency with which the hazard will occur are then discussed. This technique had gained wide acceptance in the process industries as an effective tool for plant safety and operability improvements.\n\n\n\n3F has an Emergency Response Plan and a Spill Response Plan which provide specific guidance for handling plant-wide spills and emergencies.  Both plans were recently updated to address specific hazards associated with the acrylamide manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n \n\nSection 3\n\nAccidental Release Prevention \n\n\n\n3F has implemented both procedural and technological safeguards to prevent accidental release of acrylonitrile.  Procedural safeguards are evidenced by 3F's comprehensive operational procedures and training program.  \n\n\n\nTechnological safeguards include:\n"
