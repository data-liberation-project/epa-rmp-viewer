The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release. However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cureton Front Range Gas Plant is located near Keenesburg, Colorado. It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and at the same time produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). There are no toxic substances above threshold quantities at this facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Cureton Front Range Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific process safety management (PSM) program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM.  The facility has also implemented a Program 3 Prevention Program that mirrors PSM requirements, where applicable, and integrates required aspects of public health and safety relative to plant operations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Cureton Front Range Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cureton Front Range Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments"

Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCureton Midstream believes safety is an issue that can always be improved upon. Cureton continues to look for,develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Cureton also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority."
