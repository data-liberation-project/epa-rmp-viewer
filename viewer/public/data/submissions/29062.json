Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of F.J. Krob & Company (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to farmers  for use as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 93,000 pounds in 1000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate-Release Scenario\n\na.The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a nurse tank as a gas over a period of ten minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 4300 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .8 miles.\n\nb.The alternate-release scenario is a release from a break in a one-inch transfer hose followed by release of anhydrous ammonia for two minutes before an automatic or manual shutoff intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .3 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n The facility has reviewed for general compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and  Iowa Administrative Code Part 21- Chapter 43- Rule 43.6 (200)- Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge has there been any releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community Right-to-know information as required under SARAS Tier III (EPCRS).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
