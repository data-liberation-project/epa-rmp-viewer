The facility is adjacent to the State Route 33 Highway, approximately one mile west of Route #33. The site occupies 1.6 acres. The site is adjacent to the Berry Petroleum Company Production Facilities. The area around the facility is basically uninhabited.\n\nThe Berry Cogeneration-38 Facility owned by Berry Petroleum Company. Steam and electricity are produced and sold to the local power utility company. The facility consists of a single Frame-VI General Electric Gas Turbine (rated capacity 38 MW), a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) including auxiliary duct burner rated at 300,000 pounds per hour of steam, and associated auxiliary and balance of plant systems.\n\nExhaust heat from the gas turbine is recovered in the heat recovery steam generation system. All steam produced is delivered to the Berry Petroleum Company for injection into the oil formation for enhanced oil recovery. \n\nThe site is currently operated by Solar Assets Management Services and is manned 24 hrs a day. There are five personnel assigned to the facility - (1) Lead Technician and (4) Technician II personnel. \nCogen-38 developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address Program 3 requirements in June 1999. Cogen-38 is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Cogen-38 staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia for controlling Nox emissions. \n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nCogen-38 has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, op"

Cogen-38\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in liquid form in a specifically design storage vessel. Ammonia is stored at ambient temperature in the pressurized horizontal storage tank. When ambient conditions do not significantly promote the vaporization of liquid ammonia, a vaporizer is utilized to heat the liquid to its boiling point to produce vapor. The vapor ammonia is sent to a mixing chamber where it is mixed with air. The resulting vapor ammonia / air stream is then injected into the HRSG. This, in conjunction with the catalyst within the HRSG, allow for the reduction of Nox and other unwanted materials being sent to the environment. The exhaust gas containing a lower concentration of Nox is then sent from the HRSG to an exhaust stack. \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n \nAmmonia Injection System \u00bf Anhydrous Ammonia\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (the storage tank) in ten (10) minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, the Ammonia Injection System is located outside, and no credit for passive mitigation was taken for the worst-case release scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the regulations.  RMP*Comp was used to validate the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 0.14 mg/L, for this re-submittal.  The results show the off-site areas that will be affected. This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n Alternative Rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario involves the release of ammonia from a fill line at the tank caused by a transfer hose failure. The fill line is located outside.  The release height was assumed to be at ground surface.  RMP*Comp was used to estimate the release rate.  Due to the fact that transfer operations are supervised by the Delivery Truck driver and plant personnel, it was determined that 5 minutes was conservative release duration.  \nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used. RMP*Comp was used to validate the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 0.14 mg/L.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Cogen-38 has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\u00bfAutomatic/ Manual Shutdown \n\u00bfPurge System\n\u00bfPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel,"
