              "Description": "ETMC's operation is critical to DOE's Y-12 Plant, Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL), and the City of Oak Ridge. Therefore, we must ensure that we are well-equipped and prepared to handle any potentially hazardous situation. We engineer safety into our facilities. All of ETMC's hazardous materials accumulation areas are designed with safeguards to prevent a release of hazardous materials in case of an equipment or mechanical failure.\n\nETMC complies with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management, which is a systematic approach to evaluating the entire process from design to use. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and any other elements which impact the process are all considered in the evaluation. Relevant Environmental Safety and Health (ES&H) Manual chapters define the operating procedures for safe chemical usage at ETMC. Policies and procedures are written and implemented in accordance with local, State, and Federal rules and regulations. \n\nETMC has a special work permit checklist/request form which is used for each task performed. If chemicals are used in performance of the task, the ES&H Department performs a hazard analysis to ensure positive control measures are implemented.\n\nPurchasing of chemicals is limited to the minimum quantity required to accomplish the required task, i.e., chlorine is limited to six, one-ton containers on site at any time. Buying chemicals in bulk quantities is prohibited.\n\nETMC Department Supervisors are charged with the responsibility of maintaining the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), chemical inventories, and hazard communication written program (HAZCOM) located at the department's Right-to-Know station.\n\nETMC ensures workers are informed of chemical hazards in the workplace by complying with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200. The HAZCOM program makes use of MSDSs labels and training. Employees receive orientation, and formal and specific training for the job they are to perform. HAZCOM refresher training is conducted annually.\n\nChemical handlers receive OSHA-required training such as HAZCOM, HAZWOPER, and fire safety, as well as chemical-specific hazards involved in the work task.\n\nChlorine handling presents the highest risk associated with chemicals at ETMC. The chlorine feed room and storage area is locked, and only authorized personnel are allowed into this area. The area is checked a minimum of three times, once per shift, in a 24-hour period during routine inspections.\n\nChlorine is fed into the water through a \"closed\" system to prevent personnel contact. Operators are required to use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) while changing containers. Training is consistent with the requirements in 29 CFR 1910.120(f), Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response. Public access is blocked when changing containers to minimize risk. The Emergency Response Support Organization is notified before container change or container delivery. Each activity is appropriately monitored until concluded.\n\nWhen a container is empty, the valve is closed for a few minutes before the feed line is disconnected in order to evacuate the feed line before switching to the second container. A chlorine detector (Chloralert) monitors the atmosphere in the chlorine feed room where the chlorine containers are in use. After any activation of the scrubbing system, and not later than 30 days, the operator checks the sodium hydroxide concentration. If the concentration falls below 10%, the solution is replaced.",

The system provides water for potability, cooling, process, and fire protection needs and is vital to the continuous on-line reliability of the Y-12 and X-10 facilities. Any interruption in continuous water service will have an immediate harmful impact on plant operations.\n\nThe water system is also important to public health and the economic stability of the City of Oak Ridge (OR). The city receives potable water from the DOE/OR water plant for use by domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers.\n\nRaw Water System\nThe raw water supply system starts with raw water from Melton Hill Lake (Clinch River). The River Intake/Pump Station on Pump House Road is located on the southern edge of the City of Oak Ridge, Anderson County, Tennessee. An emergency pump station consisting of two 7,000-gpm pumps is available for pumping water from an inlet cove near the original intake structure. Alternate power source (diesel/generator set) is installed to provide a backup power source.\n\nThe raw water storage tank and booster pump station along Scarboro Road has a capacity of 1.5 MG. Raw water is pumped from the River Intake/Pump Station to the raw water booster storage tank and then to the booster pump station through two parallel mains.\n\nWater Treatment System\nThe Water Treatment Plant is located on Pine Ridge, north of the Y-12 complex, approximately 1/2 of a mile northwest from the intersection of Scarboro and Bear Creek roads. The water plant's current maximum daily production capacity is 28 mill"

Water treatment includes chemical mixing using potassium permanganate and polymers, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection with chlorine. Zinc phosphate is fed as a corrosion inhibitor and fluoride is fed for dental hygiene into the clearwell. Treated water is stored on the plant site in reservoirs with 3 MG and 4 MG capacities .\n\nChlorine, a regulated substance, is used for disinfection purposes in the production of potable water. The approximate daily usage of chlorine is 170 to 350 pounds. Approximately four (4), one-ton containers are stored at the Water Treatment Plant, and two (2), one-ton containers are stored at the River Intake/Pump Station. Two containers are on line at all times. The Water Treatment Plant uses an average of one container per week, and the River Intake/Pump Station uses approximately one container every 12 days; annual chlorine usage is approximately 85,000 pounds.\n\n\nMajor Hazards\n\nChlorine is highly toxic, and gas leaks can pose a health hazard to employees and the public and may possibly interrupt water treatment. Chlorine is an irritant to the eyes, mucous membranes, and skin. Overexposure can cause an irritation in the throat and lungs. Chlorine is about 2.5 times heavier than air. Gaseous chlorine will channel, pool, and pancake in low leveled areas, and it has a high affinity for water.\n\nChlorine is a yellow-greenish gas with a characteristic penetrating and irritating odor. The range of reported odor thresholds for chlorine is 0.03 to 3.5 ppm; however, because of the fatigue of the olfactory glands, the odor does not always serve as an adequate warning of exposure.\n\nChlorine is a nonflammable gas, but it does support combustion due to its oxidational properties. Chlorine gas will react with moisture in the atmosphere to form an acidic and irritating cloud or plume. Chlorine emits toxic fumes as hydrogen chloride gas und"

This scenario was modeled on two, one-ton containers as a direct release over a 10-minute period. The result assumes Stability Class F, a wind speed of 1 meter per second, a temperature of 780 F, and 80% relative humidity. The topography is urban. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 6.91 miles. Within this radius, schools, residences, hospitals, public recreational areas, and commercial, office, and industrial areas exist. This area includes DOE National Environmental Research Park (NERP) reference and natural areas. Reference areas have representative or unique plant communities. Natural areas have rare plant habitats or unique plant communities. The population within the 6.91-mile radius is 40,000. Passive mitigation is that each one-ton container is approximately an inch thick in diameter and is locked inside a concrete building.\n\nThe alternate chlorine release scenario for a one-ton container involves tubing failure, a bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the 5/16-inch-diameter valve body opening. This scenario was modeled as a release from a horizontal, cylindrical tank with the release occurring through a short pipe or valve in the top of the tank. The chlorine escapes only as a gas. The total release is 317 pounds over a 60-minute duration period. The result assumes Stability Class D, a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, a temperature of 900 F, and 80% relative humidity.

HAZCOM refresher training is conducted annually.\n\nChemical handlers receive OSHA-required training such as HAZCOM, HAZWOPER, and fire safety, as well as chemical-specific hazards involved in the work task.\n\nChlorine handling presents the highest risk associated with chemicals at ETMC. The chlorine feed room and storage area is locked, and only authorized personnel are allowed into this area. The area is checked a minimum of three times, once per shift, in a 24-hour period during routine inspections.\n\nChlorine is fed into the water through a \"closed\" system to prevent personnel contact. Operators are required to use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) while changing containers. Training is consistent with the requirements in 29 CFR 1910.120(f), Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response. Public access is blocked when changing containers to minimize risk. The Emergency Response Support Organization is notified before container change or container delivery. Each activity is appropriately monitored until concluded.\n\nWhen a container is empty, the valve is closed for a few minutes before the feed line is disconnected in order to evacuate the feed line before switching to the second container. A chlorine detector (Chloralert) monitors the atmosphere in the chlorine feed room where the chlorine containers are in use. After any activation of the scrubbing system, and not later than 30 days, the operator checks the sodium hydroxide co"

The Oak Ridge Emergency Operations Center (OREOC) and the Y- 12 Technical Support Center (TSC) have both secure and nonsecure capabilities for connectivity with the DOE-Headquarters Emergency Operations Center and the State Emergency Operations Center.\n\nPublic Information\nETMC is a participant in the Y-12 Public Information Program that provides the framework to ensure timely and accurate information to the media and general public in the event of an emergency. At the report of an emergency, LMES and DOE make the decision about activation level of the emergency public information system. ETMC personnel are NOT authorized to provide information of any type directly to the public or media without approval of the DOE.\n\nEmergency Facilities and Equipment\nEmergency facilities and equipment are maintained adequately to support the ERO. Equipment includes information management and communication systems that are capable of ensuring that all required notifications of emergency events and all necessary exchanges of information are made. Emergency alarm systems are installed to provide for effective emergency response and emergency protective actions that may be required. Public address systems are located throughout the Oak Ridge reservation and are tested several times daily. The public at large is notified of an emergency by numerous sirens placed throughout Oak Ridge and by television and radio announcements. Plans and procedures are available to request personnel from federal and state agencies and from local governments.\n\nTraining\nThe Emergency Management Training and Drill Programs will ensure that personnel are prepared to respond, manage, mitigate, and recover from emergencies associated with ETMC operations.

Annual drills are conducted to familiarize employees with protective action implementation.\n\n\nAddressing Hazards\n\nIntegrated Safety Management Plan\nOver the past several years, the DOE has directed contractors and subcontractors to develop and implement a number of systems designed to achieve an acceptable level of safety throughout DOE operations. In compliance with the Secretary of Energy's goal of Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) and DOE Implementation Plan 95-2, ETMC has developed an Integrated Safety Management Plan (ISMP), which describes the methodology for implementing the ISMS.\n\nSimply stated, this plan provides the format for integrating Environmental, Safety and Health requirements into all ETMC activities at the DOE Oak Ridge facilities. Our objective is to systematically integrate safety considerations into management and work practices at all levels within our company, so that our company's mission and safety objectives outlined in our company policy, are accomplished while protecting the public, the worker, and the environment. Simply stated, we will do work safely.\n\nWe use the five core safety management functions established in DOE Policy (DOE P) 450.4 Safety Management System Policy to provide the necessary structure for any hazardous work activity. We apply these functions as a continuous cycle. The five core safety management functions are:\n1.    define the scope of work\n2.    identify and analyze hazards associated with the work\n3.    develop and implement hazard controls\n4.    perform work within controls\n5.    provide feedback on adequacy of controls and continuous improvement in defining and planning work\n\nETMC provides input through a variety of self-assessment, continuous improvemen"
