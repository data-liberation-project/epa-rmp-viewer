As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Ventura Coastal - Tipton has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Ventura Coastal - Tipton, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Ventura Coastal - Tipton has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

According to RMP/PSM/CalARP regulation these two systems are a single process. The South System consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping, but is not connected to either the ATF or COP System.

The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 34,300 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration processes and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nVentura Coastal - Tipton has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nVentura Coastal - Tipton's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\n- U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR ?1910.119(n)\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 ?2765.1-2765.2\n\n- USEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR ?68.95\n\n- California Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emerg"

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Ve"
