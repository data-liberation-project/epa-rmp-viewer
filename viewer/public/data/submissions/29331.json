KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of employees and contractors and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the 5 year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Taft Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC along a 2,000-mile pipeline supplying anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest corn belt where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and ships and stored until it is loaded on to barges or ships for distribution or injected into the pipeline for delivery at another facility.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Taft Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards are achieved by:\n\n?Operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that any release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable.\n?Co"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, the worst case release scenario is ?? the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint??.  In the case of the Taft Terminal, this would involve a 50,000-ton refrigerated ammonia storage tank.  Using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance ammonia vapors could travel in this hypothetical case would result in offsite impacts.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that could involve an offsite exposure to ammonia vapors, is a release from the vessel relief valves and flare.  This scenario has been selected as this event actually occurred in July of 1995.  Using the CALPUFF model, the distance that ammonia vapors could travel in this case would result in offsite impacts. \n\nThere are several active mitigation measures in place to prevent the recurrence of this incident.  These active mitigation measures include the following: 1) a liquid recirculation system; 2) a backup generator to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the flare; 3) the main flare is kept lit continuously to ensure uninterrupted combustion of ammonia vapors; and 4) a backup flare to ensure uninterrupted combustion of ammonia vapors even during failure of the main flare.  The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.\n\nThese potential ammonia releases have been communicated to the terminal employees and to local emergency response officials in St. Charles Parish.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe "

      "SummaryText": "Taft Terminal has been operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1992.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees and constant emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Ensuring no interruption in the combustion of ammonia vapors by having continuous pilots in the flares.\n?Ensuring no interruption in the combustion of ammonia vapors in the unlikely event of the main flare going out by having a backup flare.\n?Ensuring uninterrupted power supply to the process control system and the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n?Emergency shutdown buttons at the barge and ship loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the ship/barge crew in case of an ammonia release.\n?Surge bladders on the ship/barge loading lines to absorb the shock during sudden closure of the valve due to emergency shutdown.\n?A fire water deluge system on top of our largest ammonia tanks.\n?Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition monitoring system if the threshold for ammonia is exceeded.\n?Fire water cannons at the terminal for fire fighting and vapor control.\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of KNC?s trained employees have helped the facility operate safely since it was acquired in 1995.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Taft Terminal has had two incidents during the last five years, which resulted in significant on-site property damage or off-site impact:  \n\nA series of ammonia releases occurred at the Taft Terminal on July 20, 1995.

During the event, three types of releases occurred:  an initial spill of liquid ammonia from a flare stack, which wetted the outer surface of the stack and formed a rapidly evaporating pool; a continuous release of ammonia vapor due to evaporation of residual liquid ammonia in the flare throughout the duration; and periodic releases of ammonia vapor from the pressure relief valves on a storage vessel.  This incident resulted in offsite impacts including evacuation of neighboring residents and an unknown number of hospitalizations.\n\nAt approximately 11:40 PM on March 19, 1997, due to extremely high water conditions on the Mississippi River, several barges struck KNC?s river dock causing severe damage to the dock and rendering the ammonia loading equipment and piping inoperable.  The ammonia-loading pipe was broken due to the barge strike resulting in the release of approximately 6,000 pounds of ammonia vapor.  This incident resulted in on-site property damage that was estimated to be $650,000.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe terminal will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Taft Terminal with the Hahnville Fire Department, the St. Charles Parish Sheriff, and the St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the St. Charles Parish Hospital Ambulance Service, the Louisiana State Police, and the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Taft Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.
