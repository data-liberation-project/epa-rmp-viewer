Accordingly, ESG has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which rely upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the City of Commerce WTP RMP for the chlorine system.  ESG Operations, Inc. has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the chlorine storage and chlorination process and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, ESG affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\n\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of chlorine, a regulated chemical under the RMP regulation.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with chlorine at the City of Commerce WTP and actively pa"

Refresher training is provided to the employees annually.  They are aided in this work by standard operating procedures.\n\n\n\nESG Operations, Inc. management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents which may have an effect on the surrounding community.  Additionally, ESG Operations, Inc. has established procedures for emergency notification and actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. \n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe City of Commerce WTP owned by the City of Commerce is located in Commerce, Georgia.  The 5 MGD facility treats water drawn from the City's water reservoir and is treated through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations before being pumped into the City's water distribution system for use. The City of Commerce WTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of drinking water and because of quantities stored, the City of Commerce WTP is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.   As required by the RMP Regulation, ESG Operations, Inc. has conducted the Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n3.0     General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nSteps\n\n\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the City of Commerce WTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n3.1    Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology and process equipment.\n\n3.2    Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation of the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failur"

The City of Commerce Fire Department has communicated their desire to manage and respond to all hazmat incidents however ESG employees have been trained on the use of a chlorine B kit. The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of a chlorine release and to minimize the effects of such releases on the general public.  This program is routinely reviewed and updated routinely by the City of Commerce to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\n6.0    Planned changes for Improved Safety\n\n\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee participation meetings which focus on safety issues are held regularly at the City of Commerce WTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of such hazards.\n\n"
