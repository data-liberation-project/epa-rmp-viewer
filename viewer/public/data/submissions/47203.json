As part of this commitment, the Jesup mill has established and maintained health, environmental protection, and safety systems to help ensure safe operation of their processes. One component of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP).  This RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management programs (the RMP rule). The RMP rule requires regulated facilities to submit a risk management plan describing their risk management program. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that the Jesup pulp mill has developed and implemented, including:\n 2.0 - A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n 3.0 - An overview of our accidental release prevention programs \n 4.0 - A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n 5.0 - An overview of our emergency response program\n 6.0 - An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n 7.0 - The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n 8.0 - The detailed registration information (called data elements) covering our risk management program \n\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill is a three-mill, Kraft pulping complex involved in the manufacture of bleached dissolving, paper and fluff pulps. As part of this manufacturing process, we handle several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rul"

      "SummaryText": "e. The RMP-covered processes at our facility are all Program Level 3 processes and are listed below: \n1) Chlorine Process - Regulated substance Chlorine, 2,520,000 lb. Maximum process quantity (including rail car inventory).\n2) Chlorine Dioxide Process - Regulated substance Chlorine Dioxide, 26,000 lb. Maximum process quantity.  \n3) Sulfur Dioxide Process - Regulated substance Sulfur Dioxide. 66,700 lb. Maximum process quantity.\nChlorine and Chlorine Dioxide are used as pulp bleaching chemicals in our process. They are added directly to the pulp as dilute water solutions in carefully controlled bleach stages. Chlorine is used in two of our three mills while Chlorine Dioxide is used in all three mills. Sulfur Dioxide is added directly to the pulp as a dilute water solution and is used to control or stop chlorine reactions in pulp.  It is used in all three mills.\n\n\n3.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn 1994, the Rayonier Jesup Pulp Mill formalized their accidental release prevention program for eight chemical systems or processes. This program complied with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established that for Program Level 3 processes, OSHA's PSM prevention program could be used to satisfy RMP prevention requirements provided that it was updated to reflect accidental releases with potential off-site impact. This update was accomplished for our three RMP covered processes during recent Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The following is a brief description of the key elements of our OSHA PSM prevention program. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION. A variety of technical documents are maintained and used to help ensure safe operation of the Jesup mill processes. Material safety data sheets (MSDS) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Jesup mill. Engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design"

The Jesup mill ensures that this process safety information is available to all mill employees.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS. The Jesup mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) for each covered process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to perform these PHA's. PHA teams at the Jesup mill use the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented by checklists, to perform the hazard analyses. A written summary report that contains recommendations for mill management review is prepared by the team. Mill management assigns responsibility for resolution of each recommendation.  Where appropriate, changes to improve the safety of the process are implemented. PHA's are performed on each covered process at least once every five years.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES. Jesup mill process engineers, project engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures for all covered processes. These procedures describe how operations should be safely performed under conditions of process start-up, normal operations, normal shutdown and emergency shutdown. Operating procedures are used both as operating guidelines and training tools. They are reviewed by Jesup mill management on an annual basis.  All operating procedures for covered systems reside on a computer based training network and are accessible by all employees via the mill's intranet. \n\nTRAINING. Jesup mill training focuses on general process descriptions, a reviews of the properties and hazards of the process chemicals and detailed process operating procedures and safe work practices.  This is accomplished using computer based training (CBT) for all covered processes. CBT modules have been developed for each covered process and include skills testing and testing record keeping. CBT is au"

The Jesup mill employs a mechanical integrity program to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment. The program applies to all covered processes and includes equipment inspection and testing specifications, replacement parts and equipment specifications, procedures for inspection, testing and maintaining equipment, training of maintenance personnel, and documentation of maintenance activities.  The mill currently utilizes an electronic management system to schedule and notify maintenance supervision of equipment tests and inspections as well as maintain an equipment history.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE. The Jesup mill management of change procedure requires evaluation and approval of all changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes. These procedures help ensure that the change does not impact the safe operation of the process. Central to this process is the updating of process information relating to the change and communication of the change to employees involved in the covered process.  The Jesup MOC system utilizes an electronic issuance and tracking system which includes notifications for approvers and MOC coordinators of required review and action items to be addressed.  Our computer based training system is also equipped with an MOC function to notify affected employees of all changes to operating procedures resulting from a PSM MOC.\n \nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW. The Jesup mill performs a pre-startup safety review on new covered processes and covered processes undergoing significant modification. A pre-startup review team completes a checklist to document the review and to ensure that identified safety issues have been addressed.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS. Process safety compliance audits are an integral part of the Jesup mill prevention program. Audits are performed by"

The audit team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and is sufficient to help ensure the safe operation of the process. Audit results are documented, recommendations resolved and appropriate improvements to the prevention program are implemented.  Audit findings are included in the mill's Consolidated Action Plan, which receives corporate executive review.  The Jesup mill audits the prevention program using either an internal or external audit at least once every three years.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION. The Jesup mill investigates all incidents that result or could potentially result in injury to mill personnel or the public or could harm the environment.  A mill team performs this investigation and documents recommendations aimed at preventing simialr incidents from occurring in the future.  All recommendations are resolved and appropriate corrective actions are implemented.  As with other PSM elements, this too utilizes an electronic issuance and tracking system.  Those responsible for conducting the investigation as well as those assigned corrective actions from the investigation are notified via internal e-mail of required completion activities.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION. Employee participation is a key element of the Jesup mill prevention program. This participation ensures that employee concerns relative to the safety of the covered processes are fully addressed. Employees participate in PHA's, incident investigations, procedures development and compliance audits   \n\nHOT WORK PERMIT. The Jesup mill has developed hot work procedures to control spark or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in the mill covered processes. These procedures and the development of a hot work permit system comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.252(a). Training on hot work permitting is conducted annually.\n   \nCONTRACTORS.

As with mill employees, contractors are informed of the hazards of the processes they will work on, the Jesup mill emergency response procedures and the mill safe work practices. Contractors are required to provide the Jesup mill with training records and work performance is periodically reviewed to ensure that safe work practices are being followed.  \nThese prevention program elements work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the high standard that these management systems set for the way we do business.\nAs part of our ongoing prevention efforts, we have implemented several chemical-specific safety improvements. In the Sulfur Dioxide system, we have eliminated part of our storage inventory for 3% solution as well as replaced our storage vessel for 99.9% Sulfur Dioxide.  Additionally, we have implemented revised operating procedures for both the Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine systems to mitigate the amount of release due to loss of operational controls.\n\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Under the RMP rule, significant releases include those that have occurred over the last five years and resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage off-site. We have had one significant release of Sulfur Dioxide in the past five years; this was 8175 pounds of Sulfur Dioxide released over a four hour period from a faulty delivery tanker truck. There were no on site or off site injuries resulting from this release.  On-site impact was limited to $2500 in property damages.  Local emergency management personnel were alerted to the release and as a preca"

Root causes were identified and corrective actions taken to prevent similar releases from occurring in the future.  No significant releases occurred over the last five years from our Chlorine or Chlorine Dioxide systems.\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Jesup mill has a written emergency response plan for the facility to aid in safely responding to accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  This emergency response plan includes:\n\n  Procedures for how employees will respond to emergency situations.\n  Procedures for specific departmental emergency and evacuation plans\n  Procedures covering evacuation routes and safe places of refuge.\n  A description and explanation of the emergency alarm system.\n  Procedures for activation of the emergency response team.\n  A description of the incident command system.\n  Training of employees in their responsibilities during an emergency.\n  Procedures for providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous  substances.\n  Procedures for controlling and containing accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment.\n  Procedures for informing County emergency response officials of releases which could reasonably result in off-site consequences. \n  Procedures for informing the public when necessary. \n  Procedures for inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment.\n  Procedures for reviewing and updating the emergency response plan.\n\nThe Rayonier Jesup Mill maintains a twenty-four hour emergency response team trained in these emergency response procedures.  All mill personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  Rayonier periodically conducts emergency response drills.  The written emergency response plan has been communicated to the local emergency response officials.\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHA"

      "SummaryText": "NGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Jesup Mill constantly strives to improve the safety of our workers and the safety of our processes.  There are many systems in place to achieve this goal.  Currently, the entire mill is undergoing extensive training in  \"Behavior Based Safety\" to improve overall safety performance.  This program is entitled USA (Unified Safety Approach) and is underway with a steering committee guiding the effort.  The USA concept is based on changing worker safety behavior by individually conducting observations and providing feedback to other employees as they perform their duties. Incident investigations are also performed to improve safety.  These investigations are conducted whenever an incident has the potential to affect the safety of workers. Major efforts to improve our safety have continued with Jesup's SkillsNOW computer based training program.  This computer-based operating procedure/training system has been in place for several years for the Chlorine, Chlorine Dioxide and Sulfur Dioxide systems, which facilitates procedure changes and provides operators easier access to process information. Since 1995, the Jesup Annual Environmental, Safety and Health Continuous Improvement Plan has provided a focus for safety improvement. Mill-wide goals are established each year and each mill department is charged with developing an improvement plan that contributes to each element of the mill plan. Our Central Safety and Health Committee continues to provide the Jesup Mill with tangible safety improvements primarily based on active participation and suggestions from employees.  The mill is currently embarking on a two year assessment plan in pursuit of OSHA's VPP status.  \n\n\n7.0 CERTIFICATION\n\nRefer to the Form included with the RMP submittal.\n\n\n8.0 DATA ELEMENTS\n\nRefer to Section 1 Registration Information."
