      "SummaryText": "Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life in its service area by providing high quality wastewater treatment services. The mission of the organization is to protect the public health and water quality of Upstate waterways while providing the necessary infrastructure to support the local economy. Our goals are to be a world class organization and to have zero violations and an injury free workforce.\nWestern Carolina's overall approach to chemical safety is accomplished through safe handling of its Chlorine and Sulphur dioxide cylinders and thorough operator training as is described in the Process Safety Management program.\nThe Authority's primary responsibility is to treat pollutants in the wastewater discharges of residential, commercial and industrial facilities within its jurisdiction before that water is returned to streams, rivers and lakes. To carry out this responsibility, it maintains a network of more than 275 miles of trunk sewer lines, over 60 pumping stations and 12 wastewater treatment facilities. There are 15 sewer sub districts (municipalities or local jurisdictions) in the WCRSA service area which are responsible for sewer collection and lateral lines. WCRSA's systems and services must meet guidelines and standards set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environment Control (DHEC).\nWe have not experienced any major releases, reportable accidents or other events requiring evacuations or emergency response from our local fire departments, although the local fire departments are familiar with the locations and layout of our facilities and are advised of the existing chemicals.\nWestern Carolina is continually upgrading its facilities in response to the growth of its service areas and as it does, safer means of wastewater disinfection are being employed"
