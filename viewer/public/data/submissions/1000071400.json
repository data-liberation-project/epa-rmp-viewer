This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nCRNF has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of facility personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
