The MAWC North Water Treatment Plant, located on the Missouri River in Florissant, serves customers in North St. Louis County and has the capacity to produce 96 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHA??A???A?s Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA??A???A?s Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  MAWC complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.  It is MAWC??A???A?s policy to conduct our business in accordance with applicable environmental, safety and health laws and regulations.  Management fully supports efforts to safely manage process risks to prevent incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment.  In conducting our business, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.  We promote continuous improvement through business planning, ongoing training, and constant oversight of operations.

The chlorine system at the plant is designed for safety.  We follow Chlorine Institute Standards and use only equipment and materials certified for chlorine service.  Excess flow, remote isolation, and safety relief valves, as well as a vacuum system, are utilized to prevent leaks.  A process hazard analysis is performed and reviewed regularly to identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with the chlorine system.  Procedures and systems are in place to operate safely.  Comprehensive operating procedures provide clear instructions for safe operation of the chlorine system.  Process safety information is available to all employees and includes information related to chlorine hazards, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, process technology, and process equipment.   Operators are formally trained to operate the chlorine process safely, and receive classroom as well as on-the-job instruction.  Procedures are followed to ensure proper management of changes to the system and a safety review is performed prior to startup of new or modified equipment.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day and the process is continuously monitored using state-of-the-art computerized instrumentation and operator oversight.  Environmental and safety audits are conducted regularly, and corrective action follow-up is performed.  A preventive and corrective maintenance program ensures the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system, and includes procedures for equipment inspection, testing and repair.  Employees receive specialized training to perform chlorine system maintenance.  A contractor safety program i"
