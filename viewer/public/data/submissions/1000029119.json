(Presco) has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.\n\nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training\n\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facilities\n\nprocesses. The Presco policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\n\nsubstances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nPresco operates the Blakeney GU #1H & #2H Production Facility in Madison County, Texas. This facility is a natural gas processing plant which removes liquids from a gas stream. Mixed liquids removed from the gas stream are stored in a pressurized bullet tank prior to being shipped off site in tanker trucks. As evidenced in the ensuing text, the Blakeney GU #1H & #2H Production Facility is a Program 1 process.\n\n\n\nThe Blakeney GU #1H & #2H Production Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for purposes of RMP evaluation, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantity of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nPresco identified one flammable liquid mixture and zero regulated toxic substances. The identification of this exceedance indicates that the Blakeney GU #1H & #2H Production Facility is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Blakeney GU #1H & #2H Production Facility has not had any accidental releases that meet "
