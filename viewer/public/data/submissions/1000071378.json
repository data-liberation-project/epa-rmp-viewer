ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThis will serve as the Executive Summary of the policies, procedures, and activities for compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 40 CFR 68.79, for Breitburn Operating, L.P.'s Dry Trail Gas Plant. Breitburn Operating, L.P. and the Dry Trail Gas Plant are committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors, visitors, and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, training, design safety, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Breitburn understands that strong health, safety, and environmental principles, properly integrated into our management processes, and day to day practices greatly contributes to our business success.\n\n\n\nII.    FACILITY DETAILS AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HELD\n\nThe Dry Trail Gas Plant is located in Texas County, Oklahoma, 12 miles north of Guymon, Oklahoma on Highway 136, 10 miles west on County Road 7. Dry Trail Plant recovers Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from the natural gas stream and utilizes the liquid CO2 by injection for secondary oil recovery. In the process of extracting CO2 and returning it to a liquid state, natural gas liquids are also recovered. The NGLs are then processed into high ends and low ends, which separates the NGLs and condensate. The natural gas liquids and condensate are regulated flammable mixtures (comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes). The Dry Trail Plant also utilizes propane refrigeration. There are no threshold quantities of 112(r) regulated toxic substances at the facility. The Dry Trail Gas Plant is a Program Level 1 facility because"

      "SummaryText": " the distance to any receptor is greater than the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario, the facility has not had an accidental release of the regulated substances in the previous five years, and emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders. \n\n\n\nIII.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Dry Trail Gas Plant is a Program Level I facility. Thus, an executive summary is not required. However, since the facility is covered under Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations, a copy of the PSM requirements and elements are maintained at the facility office. \n\nThe processes at the Dry Trail Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continue safe operation. The Dry Trail Plant has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The Dry Trail Plant uses release detection systems such as hydrocarbon detectors and alarms, and release mitigation measures such as process relief valves that discharge to a flare, automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters, diking and containment to contain liquid releases, redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system), and atmospheric release. The Dry Trail Plant uses release mitigation techniques such as trained emergency response personnel and personal protective equipment. \n\n\n\nIV.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention. No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. Since plant start up in 1996, there has not been a single release of any regulated substance.\n\n\n\nV.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Dry Trail Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists"

      "SummaryText": " of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatments for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as necessary instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Dry Trail Plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\n"
