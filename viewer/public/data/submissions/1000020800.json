      "SummaryText": "Background Data:\n\nGreat Lakes Cheese of La Crosse and its parent company Great Lakes Cheese, Inc. operate a facility in La Crosse Wisconsin. This facility purchases cheese and dairy ingredients from locations throughout the U.S.  The cheese and ingredients are blended and pasteurized to manufacture pasteurized process cheese slice, loaves and blocks for food service, retail and as ingredients for other food manufacturers.  An important part of this operation is keeping this aforementioned material cold. For this, anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) will be used as the refrigerant. The maximum intended inventory is 22,000 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nGreat Lakes Cheese is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. This commitment includes the ammonia refrigeration system. To further safety in our facility, the refrigeration system is constructed under permit from local authorities, such as the building and fire departments. Additionally, we adhere where appropriate to industry-consensus codes and standards, including the ASHRAE Safety Code for Refrigeration and the IIAR-2 standard of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration. Finally, to comply with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we implement a method called Process Safety Management to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated and maintained safely.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of our final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant. To achieve this, Great Lakes Cheese uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112A regulated substance, as the refrigerant in the cooling system.\n\nMost large refrigerated facilities use a chemical called anhydrous ammonia as a vital part of the refrigeration system.

      "SummaryText": "Ammonia performs the same functions as the hydrochlorofluorocarbon - \"Freon\" refrigerants used in home air conditioners, refrigerators, automobiles, etc. Ammonia is the most environmentally friendly, energy, and capital efficient refrigerant available for industrial applications; \"Freons\" are not suitable for many industrial uses. Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, it is considered a hazardous material.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWe use a variety of methods to ensure that accidental releases of hazardous materials are prevented to the greatest extent possible. In addition to professional design and installation to accepted engineering standards, our Process Safety Management program includes elements addressing:\nEmployee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\nProcess Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the design limits of the refrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\nProcess Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system and some major modifications to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\nOperating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\nMechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We use a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\nTraining: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\nManagement of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\nPre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\nContractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our proper"

The plan includes first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and follow up.  The plan is updated as appropriate to reflect any changes within the facility that would require a modification of our emergency response. Great Lakes Cheese coordinates it's emergency response activities with the LaCrosse Fire Department and La Crosse Emergency Management.\n\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nThrough our Process Safety Management program, we systematically look for possible system changes to improve safety in our facility. As changes are made or as process hazards analysis studies are updated, safety issues and improvements are identified and made as a matter of course. Our adherence to accepted codes and standards drastically reduces the number of safety issues in a change; safety is desig"
