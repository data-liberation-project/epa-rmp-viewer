      "SummaryText": "\nSchwan places a high priority on chemical safety.  The corporate environmental manager is assigned responsibility for ammonia refrigeration safety.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain 3-shift coverage of emergency responders trained at the 24-hour technician level.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen pockets.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, with a system inventory of 27,400 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios are calculated using RMP*comp and urban conditions.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe facility has experienced no releases reportable under the EPCRA 304 rules.  None resulted in onsite or offsite casualties or offsite evacuations. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response team has about 25 members, all trained at the 24-hour technician level by the corporate environmental compliance manager.  Training emphasizes ammonia safety, mechanical isolation, protective equipment including use of level A suits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS).  Emergency plans are filed with the local fire department and annual walk-throughs are conducted with fire officers.  Pre-planned command posts and staging areas are designated and IC transfer and liaison protocols have been established.  Post incident de-briefings are conducted.\n\n\n\nSchwan continuous improvement process, a designated PSM team and post-incident reviews are used to improve system safety and emergency response.\n\n"
