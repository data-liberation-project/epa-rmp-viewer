(ONEOK North System) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK North SystemA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lemont Storage Facility is owned and operated by ONEOK North System, L.L.C.  At the facility, normal butane, isobutane, propane, and natural gasoline are received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks or underground storage caverns until they are transferred, via pipeline to the customer.  Additionally, propane is transferred via pipeline to our local truck terminal to be loaded on trucks for distribution.  Propane, normal butane, isobutene, and natural gasoline (reported as an RMP flammable mixture) are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  There are no RMP toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place a"

Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\nA?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Lemont Storage Facility is operating under the guidelines of OSHAA?s Standard 29 CFR 1910.110.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nA?    Gas detectors have been installed at the facility which will alarm and shutdown pipeline delivery and truck unloading.\nA?    Manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\nA?    Fire eyes have been installed at various locations to warn of a fire at the facility.\nA?    High pressure in the pipeline will automatically shutdown pipeline injection.\nA?    Interlocks on the spheres or cavern inlet valves will close if the level and/or pressure get too high.\nA?    Surveillance cameras have been installed for security and operational purposes.\nA?    The Pipeline Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, has certain monitoring and remote ESD capabilities.\nA?

The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\nA?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nA?    The Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\nA?
