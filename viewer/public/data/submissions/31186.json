      "SummaryText": "1.The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\n\nThe Na-Churs/Alpine facility located in red Oak, Iowa complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our ammonia storage system, it is our policy to immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2. A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use. The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia. The ammonia storage process consists of two above ground storage tanks (30,000 gallons each) and associated piping, valves, pumps and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3. The worst case scenario:\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential failure of one of the 30,000-gallon storage tanks (the largest vessel) filled to 90% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each ammonia tank to 90% capacity), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization. Utilizing a computer-based version (RMP*Comp Version 1.07) of the methodology presented in USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, April 1999, the distance to toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be 0.6 miles. The public receptors affected under this worst-case scenario include schools, private residences, office and or industrial facilities. The residentail population within this 0.6 mile radius is approximately 1076 persons, which was estimated using USEPA's Environmental Justice Geographic Assessment Tool.\n\n4. The alternative release scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential release of ammonia through the transfer hose (i.e. caused by the rupture of a connection between the ammonia unloading s"

The release rate of ammonia from the 2\" diameter transfer hose with an initial operating flow of 120 gallons per minute was determined using RMP* Comp, to be 4.44 pounds per minute to the outside air. It was estimated that the release occurred for a duration of 0.2 minutes. Therefore the alternative release scenario modeled a release of a total of 52 pounds of ammonia. Utilizing RMP*Comp Version 1.07, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be less than 0.1 miles. The public receptors affected under this scenario include private residences, offices and or commercial facilities. The residential population within this 0.1 mile radius is 30 persons, which was estimated by USEPA's Environmental Justice Geographic Assessment Tool.\n\n5. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law at the Na-Churs facility in Red Oak, Iowa.\n\n6. Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility has never had an accident involving its ammonia storage process. The accident history includes no events resulting deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n7. The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving ammonia storage system, it is Na-Churs' policy to immediately notify the Red Oak Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency. We have communicated this policy with the Red Oak Fire Department.\n\n8. Planned changes to improve safety: None"
