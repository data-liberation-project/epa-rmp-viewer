The receiving goods procedure details for the identification of the chemical to be offloaded to avoid cross contamination with the wrong chemical. High and low level indicators are installed on the receiving tank. The valves invloved in the offloading of this chemical are locked during regular operation and must be physically removed by authorized personel to allow offloading. The quality system is set up to set forth the location of all maintenance records, schedules, and inspections within an electronic maintenance system (MapCon). The quality system is audited on a schedule and allow for the quality and safety commitees to utilize an issues database to track failures of the system, incident investigations, and quality issues. There are operational rounds for visual checks for potential leaks as well. The above information is detailed in the executive summary as well.",

      "SummaryText": "\n\nPioneer Trail Energy Facility Prevention Program and Executive Summary\n\nPTE has completed this RMP utilizing EPA tools available as well as external consultation for completion of the Process Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Management tools. Aqueous Ammonia (23%) is one chemical that will be utilized onsite which falls under the RMP applicability in a threshold quantity. Due to the 23% percentage as well as the NA code of 325193 Ethyl Alcohol Manufacturing code, the 23% aqueous ammonia falls into program level 2. In order to eliminate and control hazards, quality system procedures have been developed to provide instruction on the receiving, offloading, and use of 23% aqueous ammonia. As well as start up, shut down, and emergency procedures for the operation of the plant. The maintenance records of the tank, valves, and indicators for the ammonia system will be stored in the electronic maintenance system, MapCon. The quality system will utilize a committee, audits, and tracking to ensure procedures are adequate and implemented in a scheduled manner. The RMP program will be updated and completed by the Technical Manager and tracked using the compliance calendar. Training is defined, implemented, and tracked to ensure employees are aware and capable to deal with hazards in the workplace. Any future incidents, process changes, and items to address from compliance audits will be logged in the issues database for all to learn from. PTE is committed to the safety of the employees and the general public which would be affected in the event of an incident involving 23% aqueous ammonia. In order to avoid pentane and isopentane releases, loading of Fuel Ethanol procedures have been developed as well as an offloading of denaturant procedure . Operational rounds are frequent and would detect any issue with the ethanol storage tanks.                                                                                                                                               \n"
