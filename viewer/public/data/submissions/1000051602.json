      "SummaryText": "United Dairy Farmers, Inc. (UDF), owns a stationary source (UDF Campus) in Erlanger, Kentucky. The UDF Campus operates two (2) separate ammonia refrigeration processes (\"Distribution Center\" and \"Cold Chain Integrity\"). Both ammonia refrigeration processes use industry standard mechanical refrigeration designs including multiple evaporators, condensers, compressors, and liquid ammonia storage vessels. \n\n \n\nThe Distribution Center process is managed, supervised and operated exclusively by UDF employees. Approximately 80% of the product stored in the Distribution Center refrigerated and frozen space is manufactured by UDF. UDF also operates a small consumer ice making operation within the Distribution Center.\n\n \n\nThe Cold Chain Integrity process is managed, supervised and operated exclusively by UDF employees.   Approximately 25% of the available space is leased to tenants who handle their respective products themselves, with UDF employees handling the bulk of the in-bound and outbound containers for various other customers who rent refrigerated storage space. \n\n \n\nOn-site facility management and supervision is controlled by UDF employees.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. (UDF), is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with our ammonia refrigeration systems. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of ammonia. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our safety systems are designed to protect and mitigate the impacts associated, as well as a highly trained emergency response personnel are available to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the City of Norwood Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC for "

      "SummaryText": "emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur UDF Campus in Erlanger, Kentucky is primarily used for cold storage. The only RMP regulated substance present at the campus is anhydrous ammonia which is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. Refrigeration is a critical part of our business, providing cold storage capabilities for products per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Due to the characteristics of our refrigeration Process, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur UDF Campus has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Our UDF Campus is also subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that are in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nOur UDF Campus maintains a record of process safety information that describes the information pertaining to the hazards of Anhydrous Ammonia, information pertaining to the technology of the refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur UDF Campus conducts process hazards analyzes so that hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP and What-If Scenarios and Checklist provided by the IIAR. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in refrigeration engineering and process operations and maintenance, and are validated at a minimum of every five (5) years.

These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown. The procedures are reviewed and certified annually and are readily accessible to all personnel who work on, in and adjacent to the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nOur UDF Campus has a comprehensive training program in place so that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed. United Dairy Farmers, Inc. utilizes RETA certifications to supplement training for ammonia refrigeration personnel.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe UDF Campus carries out maintenance inspections/tests on ammonia refrigeration equipment to ensure the integrity of the equipment. Process equipment examined by these inspections/tests includes among others: pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief valves, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance tasks are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in applicable maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections/tests are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes made to the refrigeration technology, equipment, and/or procedures. Refrigeration Technicians or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification to the refrigeration process are promptly made aware of and trained on the change(s).\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety re"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to the introduction of ammonia to the modified or new equipment.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. conducts audits at least every three (3) years to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. Any corrective actions identified during these audits are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an unintentional release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any necessary corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained fo\n\nr a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nUnited Dairy Farmers, Inc. truly believes that Process Safety Management (PSM) and accident prevention is a team effort.
