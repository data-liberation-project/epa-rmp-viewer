Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Panther Creek Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by ONEOK.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing a 90,000,000 cubic feet per day cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There is a product surge tank with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons which contains demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in an amount greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regu"

      "SummaryText": "lation.    The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n \nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the flammable mixture in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Panther Creek Gas Plant, this would involve our 30,000-gallon product surge tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.5 miles (approximately 2,600 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA\u0012s threshold for measurable impacts.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, etc.) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,600 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our demethanizer tower due to the relief valve on the vessel sticking open.  We have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  These measures include the following:  1) We conduct regular visual inspec"

The presence of these mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur.\n\nWe have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Custer County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.   \n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Panther Creek Gas Plant has been operating under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since 1995.  Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We installed a continuously-lit flare system that will burn off any hydrocarbon vapor when high pressure is encountered within the plant.  As a backup, the flare has an automatic ignition source in case the flame was ever extinguished.\n \n7 We provided manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons (which are tested semiannually) at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.   \n \n7 We installed gas detectors in the compressor room in order to detect fl"

These fire extinguishers are inspected annually by third party inspectors and monthly by plant employees.\n \nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility for many years.\n \n \nFive Year Accident History\n \nNo incident having resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Panther Creek Gas Plant within the last five years.  Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Panther Creek Gas Plant with the Clinton Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Clinton Sheriff, Clinton Hospital, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.  The Panther Creek Gas Plant Operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n \n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the leve"

In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Custer County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
