All of us are responsible and accountable for adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy. All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities. It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\n \n\nFacility Description:\n\nThe primary activity at the Chicopee Plant is the manufacture of chemical additives used in the pulp and paper industry.  The plant's two main processes are emulsion sizes (Hercons and Aquapels) and wet-strength resins (Kymenes).  The sizes prevent wetting and penetration of the pulp fibers and are used in a variety of products from writing paper to food packaging.  The wet-strength resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc. so that they will not come apart easily when they get wet. \n\nEpichlorohydrin is a raw material for the Kymene process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the wet-strength resin.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin in tank trucks and railroad tank cars and stores the material in a gallon storage tank that holds a maximum of 206,000 pounds.  The storage tank is provided with a containment dike to minimize the adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks are unloaded.\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario:\n\nThe worst case scenario for epichlorohydrin is the failure of an entire rail car containing 166,000 pounds of epichlorohydrin.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint, not taking into account any passive mitigation, is approximately 1.53 miles based on the use of the SLAB model.  The potential population that could be affected by such a release is approx"

      "SummaryText": "imately 31,000 people (as calculated using EPA's Landview III database).  This distance is an upper bound for this release.  This scenario requires the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic failure of the rail car.  The rail cars are unloaded from the top, which means that an unloading hose failure cannot cause a release of the entire car.\n\n\nAlternative Case Scenario:\n\nThe alternative case scenario for epichlorohydrin is a line break outside of the containment dike that results in a release of 15,000 pounds of epichlorohydrin.  This scenario gives a distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.26 miles based on the use of the ALOHA model.  The potential population that could be affected by such a release is approximately 1,100 people.  The impact from this scenario is limited by the operating procedures, which would limit the duration of the spill to no more than 10 minutes.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nThe Chicopee plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nIn the past five years, the Chicopee Plant has not had any accidental releases of epichlorohydrin that have resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off-site impacts.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Chicopee Plant has written emergency response plans and coordinates emergency response matters with the Chicopee Fire Department and the District Hazmat team.  The plant provides ongoing emergency response training for all plant employees.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nRecently, a project was approved to revise the epichlorohydrin railca"
