This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) \"American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" (6th edition), commonly referred to as \"ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\", as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program. \n\n  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:  \n\n          -    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n          -    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in plac"
