The Augusta Plant has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Augusta Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RM Plan) describing the risk management program at the Augusta Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RM Plan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Augusta Plant.\n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Augusta Plant is committed to the safety of Pfizer employees, its contractors, and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The Augusta Plant implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain such releases.  The Augusta Plant evaluates each situation, and if necessary, evacuates workers and contractors, and responds based on our capabilities and training. If necessary, the Augusta Plant will contact the Richmond County Fire department to assist in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.

The radios have been placed in key locations in each facility, so that 24 hour coverage is ensured. The City of Augusta local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and the local police and fire departments, have also established a system to use for warning the community if a potentially threatening accident occurs.\n\nThe Augusta Site Director has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at Pfizer Global Manufacturing - Augusta Plant.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Site Director to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Site Director.  Those relationships are depicted on the organization chart maintained by the Site Director's staff.  The emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is the responsibility of the Director of Environmental, Health and Safety. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the plant Health and Safety Lead, who reports to the Director of Environmental, Health and Safety.  Similarly, specific responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the plant Safety Specialist. In keeping with our policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\n1.2\tPfizer Global Manufacturing - Augusta Plant Regulated Substances\n\nThe Augusta Plant is a pharmaceutical drug substance manufacturing plant located in Augusta, Georgia.  \"Drug substance\" means the active ingredients for medicines that are made from raw materials.

Pfizer has taken measures in recent years to minimize or eliminate the use of toxic substances in its operations; this is the only RMP-covered process we have at the Augusta site.\n\n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Augusta Plant.  Since processes at the Augusta Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Plan regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by the Augusta Plant, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\n\n1.4\tEmployee Participation\n\nThe Augusta Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of process hazard analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and compliance audit teams.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Augusta Plant PSM program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the PSM program are documented in the Process Safety Management Procedure which is distributed through out the site. In addition, the Augusta Plant personnel sit on the sites safety committee. This team promotes both process and personal safety. The team typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n1.5\tProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Augusta Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific operating areas within the Augusta Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. These documents are readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented, where necessary, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Augusta Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Augusta Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe Augusta Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n1.6\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Augusta Plant has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate control"

These analysis methods are recognized as appropriate for determination of the hazards of the process being evaluated.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process does not eventually deviate significantly from the original design, the Augusta Plant periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and recommendations from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\n1.7\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe Augusta Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of"

In addition, the Augusta Plant operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n1.8\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Augusta Plant has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive initial training which educates them on Environmental Health and Safety procedures along with departmental specific requirements. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a top level operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This certification training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n1.9\tContractors\n\nThe Augusta Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Augusta Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  The Augusta Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n1.10\tPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Augusta Plant conducts pre-startup safety reviews for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the review is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and supporting systems are operationally ready.  A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n1.11\tMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Augusta Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Augusta Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n1.13\tSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Augusta Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a conf"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n1.14\tManagement of Change\n\nThe Augusta Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change.\n\n1.15\tIncident Investigation\n\nThe Augusta Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to The Augusta Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n1.16\tCompliance Audits"

      "SummaryText": "To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Augusta Plant periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team, which includes corporate EHS personnel, develops findings that are forwarded to The Augusta Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n  \n1.17\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Augusta Plant will continue to manage hazards to ensure continued safe operations. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to this EPA RMP-covered process as well as OSHA PSM-covered processes at the Augusta Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Augusta Plant has safety features on the Regulated Substance, to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in these processes, except when otherwise noted: \n\n(1) Release Containment/Control\n\n* * Process relief valves that vent to prevent overpressure damage to equipment \n\n* Process tank relief valves/rupture discs that discharge to prevent overpressure damage to equipment \n\n* Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature, high pressure)\n\n* Curbing or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n* Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective"

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, plant evacuation plans and accounting for plant personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Augusta Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or facilities.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Augusta Plant is coordinated with the Richmond County Fire department and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Augusta Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The Augusta Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve local emergency response organizations. The Augusta site also hosts plant tours with local responders to inform them of the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\n1.19\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Augusta Plant constantly strives to improve the safety of its operations through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.  The Augusta Plant resolves all findings from Process Hazard Analyses, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of reviews, changes and improvements are ongoing efforts at the facility and will be implemented during the next 5 years:\n\n* Review/revise the operating procedures \n* Perform piping and equipment inspections \n* Review/revise emergency training procedures"
