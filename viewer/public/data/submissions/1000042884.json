The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\r\n\r\nAntonio Leal, Water Plant Superintendent, is the responsible official at the Edinburg Water Filtration Plant. The Water Filtration Plant is located at 500 E. Mahl, Edinburg, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building sits on the south side of the plant and consists of a ten by ten-foot room with two, 1-ton Chlorine cylinders next to the building and facing north. One cylinder is operational and the other used for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply.
