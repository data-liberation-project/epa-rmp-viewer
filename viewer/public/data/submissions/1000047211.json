The facility has a gross output of 723.3 MW, with a net output of 665 MW. The boiler utilizes Low NOx burners and overfire air in conjunction with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) module for NOx control. Anhydrous Ammonia, as a vapor, is injected into the SCR module for conversion of the NOx emissions into nitrogen and water. Additional emission control equipment associated with the pulverized coal-fired boiler include baghouse for Particulate control, activated carbon injection for Mercury control, and a Spray Dryer Absorber / Dry Flue Gas Desulfurization unit for SO2 control. The Spray Dryer Absorber operation utilizes calcium hydroxide for SO2 removal.\r\nThe facility also operates a 285 MMBtu/hr #2 fuel oil fired Auxiliary Boiler used to assist with startup of the coal-fired boiler and emergency operations. The Auxiliary Boiler is limited to 500 hours of operations per years. The Auxiliary Boiler does not utilize any RMP/PSM r"
