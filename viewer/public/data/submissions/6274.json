FMC employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is an approximately 7 acre complex located on the west side of Rochester.  A highway embankment 25 to 30 ft. high on the east side of the facility will impede the spread of an ammonia cloud so the topography is considered to be urban.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and distributed as a fertilizer material to our farmer customers.  The maximum quantity stored in the single 30,000 gal. tank is 140,196 lbs. or 25,500 gal.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at 1.16 miles from the tank.  Due to the location of the tank in relation to the highway emabankment the greatest impact would be to the businesses and residences directly accross the road from the facility.  \n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .56 miles from the tank.  Again, the buildngs accross the road would be impacted the most.\n\nFMC has instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana State Chemist into the plan.\n\nThis facility has not had a release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is in place and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  All new employees will receive this training.  All emergency response agencies have received training in the hazards associated with responding to a release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIt is the policy of FMC to remain proactive in the area of accident prevention and minimization of loss in the event of a releas"
