Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local LEPC so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\nFacility information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The maximum quantity stored would be 375,000 pounds in the facility's two tanks and nurse tanks.\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 100,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 2 miles. The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 180 inch transfer hose, with 40 pounds released over 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .32 miles.\nThe accidental release program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with NSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\nThe five-year accident history: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property dama"

Our emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local LEPC for coordination in the community response planning.\nPlanned changed to improve safety: Safety improvements is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaulations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. In accordance with Illinois Department of Ag regulations, fold down platforms, break-aways, replacement of excess flow valves are being addressed and will be completed prior to Fall 2004.\n"
