Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Food Lion has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.\n\nCorporate Commitment to Safety:\n\nFood Lion is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining a\"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n\nIt is the policy of Food Lion to:\n\nProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\nComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\nProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\nEnsure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a safe manner.\n\nEducate and/or train all employees in safe work practices, and ensure that each employee fully understands his or her job, equipment, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk to himself or herself and their co-workers.\n\nEncourage all employees to \"Think Safety,\" so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\nThe Center's  aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as po"

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\nFood Lion has prepared a Center safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the Center. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated Center personnel to carry out these programs.\n\nThe first duty of each Food Lion employee is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n\nCenter Description:\n\nFood Lion Distribution Center # 2 coupled with its normal activities, also operates as a  cold storage distribution Center in Disputanta, Virginia.  The Center is primarily responsible for storage, processing and resourcing Food Lion grocery stores. The Center is located in the rural area of the city of Disputanta, VA.  At any give time approximately 500 employees including truck drivers may work at the Center.   Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) is located on site, in various locations and quantities and will be used as a refrigerant, replacing the current Freon system currently used at the Center.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia will be utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration Process,\" approximately 14,040 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.

The Center\u00bfs machine room houses the compressors, pilot receiver, and a High and Low Temperature Recirculator.  A condenser is also located on the roof of the Center.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1), the worst-case release scenario involves a failure within the process system. This scenario involves a vessel rupture that results in a total of 2,007 pounds of anhydrous ammonia being released in a 10-minute period.  This release amount is based on the High Temperature Recirculator\u00bfs normal operating level of 10%.  Although the High Temperature Recirculator is capable of holding a higher capacity of ammonia, this would exceed administrative procedures, which limits the liquid level in the High Temperature Recirculator to exceed 10 %. \n\nConsidering that a \"catastrophic\" possibility does exist for this vessel to release the entire contents, engineering controls incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release. No passive or active mitigation systems were considered for this scenario.  Using ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) the distance to the endpoint for such a release would be 1.6 miles.  \n\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the loss of anhydrous ammonia through a safety relief valve that is installed on one of the process system's vessels containing liquid ammonia. Such a release would be vented through the relief valve vent stack that opens to atmosphere.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release, based on ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) is 0.08 miles.  The potential receptor impacts are discussed in Section 3.2 and shown on the map in Appendix B of this document.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nFood Lion is equipped with an emergency information system.
