(Air Liquide) El Segundo Hydrogen facility (Hydrogen Facility) is located within the Chevron El Segundo refinery complex in El Segundo, CA.  The Hydrogen Facility steam methane reforming process is considered the covered process, as defined under the Federal and state accidental release prevention regulations, as a flammable mixture process having an inventory in excess of 10,000 pounds.\r\nThe Hydrogen Facility steam methane reforming process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using refinery and natural gas feedstocks. The hydrogen reforming and purification is performed at elevated pressure. High pressure purified hydrogen is transported to other refinery units via intra refinery pipeline.   The El Segundo Hydrogen Facility is designed for continuous safe operation.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nAir Liquide El Segundo Hydrogen Facility is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to California and Federal accidental release prevention regulations and OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.   The Hydrogen Facility steam methane reforming process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  The flammability of the process makes it necessary to put in place safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human error and to reduce the potential threat to personnel, nearby commun"

This system is comprised of a group of corporate procedures and standards under the life safety program.  Procedures in place include:  energy control; safe work; hot work; confined space entry and process line break.  Facility personnel are trained on these safe work practices to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nAir Liquide uses outside contractors to support maintenance activities.  Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP.  Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors:  (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency prior to their beginning work. Contractors ae prequalified and periodically re-evaluated to ensure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the Hydrogen Facility covered process.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nAir Liquide's accidental release prevention program activities helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.

The Chevron Fire Department EAP is reviewed annually.  The Hydrogen Facility employees are trained annually to first responder awareness level to be ready in the event of accidental releases of a regulated substance.   The EAP provides details for emergency health care and the safe evacuation of facility personnel, contractors and visitors.  The EAP describes communicating with Chevron Refinery Fire Department, the El Segundo Fire Department UPA and other outside agencies in the event of a loss of containment of the Hydrogen Facility flammable covered process.   \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe El Segundo Hydrogen Facility resolves all findings of its PHA and other hazard reviews some of which result in modifications of the process.  For example, recently the Hydrogen Facility disconnected and removed liquid pentane steam methane reformer feedstock system from service reducing the Hydrogen Facility onsite flammable substance process inventory by 30,000+ pounds."
