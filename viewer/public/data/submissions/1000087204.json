The summary below discusses the process safety system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAir Liquide has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled.  The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and continues to undergo periodic PHA's and PHA re-validations at least every five years.  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards.   The PHA team will review findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item tracking system. \n\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action.  These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process.
