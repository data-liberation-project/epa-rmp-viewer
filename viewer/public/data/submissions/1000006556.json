The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, the program prevents accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoids physical property damage.\n\nOur safety program is applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combinations of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents by focusing on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and continually improved.  All rules are communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. \n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers, that are used to change the state of NH3 from a gas to a liquid and is a closed loop system.  The motor and compressor are separate entities, and can be worked on should repairs be needed.  The ammonia is used in the freezing of vegetables.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed in accordance wit"

      "SummaryText": "h OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.110 and EPA Risk Management Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Requirements\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity Audits\nHot Work Permits\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nEmergency Planning and Response\nCompliance Audits\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOn September 3, 2008 at 8:27 p.m. a safety flow switch malfunctioned, indicating no water flow, and shut off Compressor CP106.  The pressure on the return line then increased (normal pressure is 52 PSI) and continued to build and exceed 150 PSI.  This caused a relief valve to actuate and alleviate the line pressure.  The leak was ventilated and some liquid ammonia that gathered on the roof was subsequently absorbed with floor dry.  \n\nTotal elapsed spill duration was estimated at 15 minutes.  Release amount is estimated at 500 pounds.  \n\nAlthough the safety system performed properly, due to the atmospheric conditions, ammonia that was ventilated to the roof sunk in the air and entered through the facility's windows.  The plant's Emergency Response Team and the Waseca Fire Department responded.  The ammonia level, recorded at 8:35 p.m., was less than 7 PPM (OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit is 50 PPM).  23 employees were transported to the Emergency Room and received oxygen as a treatment.  All employees were released after receiving oxygen.  Bird's Eye Foods reported the incident to the Minnesota Duty Officer and The National Response Center.\n\nAs a result of the incident, Birds Eye Foods has responded by initiating administration and engineering controls on the ammonia system.  As an additional process control and mitigation system, a spill container with a small vent was installed on the roof over the relief line.  This preventative measure will ensure that any future ammonia discharged "

Birds Eye Foods has also re-trained all ammonia operators, reviewed and revised all standard operating procedures, and revised maintenance procedures.  Relief valves are now annually inspected for proper operation in addition to the mandatory 5-year replacement rule.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Waseca facility's emergency response program is in accordance with OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Waseca Fire Department and annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan are conducted at the facility."
