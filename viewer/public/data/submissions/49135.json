      "SummaryText": "Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC, referred to as HLBE herein, is a newly constructed facility.  Since HLBE is a new facility, the reports and information relevant to this Plan are recently developed.  All included reports and information were reviewed and approved by HLBE management prior to the start up of the facility.  There has never been a change in management; therefore, the new management was implemented with the construction of the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nHeron Lake BioEnergy, LLC, is committed to worker and public safety and has invested significant resources to prevent accidents.  These resources include personnel training as well as considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\nIt is HLBE's policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responsders, as necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nHeron Lake BioEnergy, LLC ethanol plant is located in Heron Lake, Jackson County, Minnesota.\n\nHLBE manufactures fuel grade ethanol from corn operating 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  The substances regulated under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia, Propane, and Natural Gasoline, known as Denaturant at the facility.  With the amount of Anhydrous Ammonia stored on-site, HLBE has determines that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be about 5.6 miles. The radius of impact from a worst-case release of Propane is 0.7 miles.  For the Denaturant, the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be 0.7 miles.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA:\n\nA release of 168,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which would create a toxic vapor cloud, is the worst-case scenario at the facility.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release of the entire Anhydrous"

      "SummaryText": "Ammonia tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the facility.  There are approximately 766 residential receptors within the 5.6 mile radius.  Other public receptors include a school, residences, and a small recreational area.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Heron Lake Memorial Field, Duck Lake, and Heron Lake.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR PROPANE:\n\nA release of 120,000 pounds of Propane, which would create a vapor cloud explosion, is the worst-case scenario at the facility.  This scenario is based on the release of the entire Propane tank.  The vapor cloud explosion endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility/  There are approximately 9 residential receptors plus HLBE personnel within the 0.7 mile radius endpoint.  Environmental receptors include the shorlines of Heron Lake.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS RESULTS FOR DENATURANT:\n\nA release of 600,000 pounds of denaturant, which would create a vapor cloud explosion, is the worst-case scenario at HLBE.  A release of the entire denaturant tank would be a worst-case scenario for the facility.  The vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 mile radius from the center of the facility.  These receptors include residences.  Environmental receptors within the radius include Heron Lake Memorial field and the shorlines of Heron Lake.\n\nA Process Safety Management Program has been implemented for Heron lake BioEnergy, LLC, since the facility qualifies as a Level 3 Program.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nSince the facility is a newly constructed ethanol facility, Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC is subject to RMP upon delivery of anhydrous ammonia, propane, and denaturant.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\n\nHLBE has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health & Safety Plan.  An SPCC will be prepared and implemented in accordance with the applicable regulatory stan"
