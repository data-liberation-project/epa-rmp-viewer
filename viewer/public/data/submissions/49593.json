However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Kane gas processing plant is located approximately 3 miles east of Kane, PA on state highway 6.  The plant processes about 10 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehyrdrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed to produce a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are removed are fractionated into propane and a butane/gasoline mixed product.  Total liquid production is about 210 BPD with total propane and butane/gasoline mix storage capacity of 3571 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, hydrate suppression, and utilizes a refrigerated process for hydrocarbon removal.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such propane, natural gasoline.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps::\n\nThis facility is constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for gas processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program.  Written programs and procedures  cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific steps include:\n\nThe Kane plant includes the following safety features:\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms;\n\n2. Process safety relief valves;\n\n3. Automated plant shutdown system (the plant will be automatically shutdown should key process variables vary from specified ranges);\n\n4. Manual val"

Appropriately placed fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires;\n\n7. Excess flow valves on product storage;\n\n8. Breakaway connections on product loading hoses to stop flow if a hose is pulled off;\n\n9. Automated call-out system to notify plant operator(s) of abnormal operation.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility and has not experienced any accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on  site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Kane Plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the McKean County Control Office.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned. However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
