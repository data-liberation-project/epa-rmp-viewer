      "SummaryText": "-INTRODUCTION-\n\nThe BASF Corporation, Kankakee, Illinois, facility considers protection of employees, the public and the environment to be its most important responsibility.  A key element of its protection program is the development and implementation of plans to prevent accidental chemical releases.  In addition, if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to respond in an organized and effective manner.\n\nThe BASF Corporation, Kankakee, Illinois, facility accident prevention and emergency response programs have been developed in accordance with federal and state regulations, industry standards, and coordination from Kankakee County emergency response organizations.  Although the facility's programs have been highly successful - the facility has never had a significant chemical release - the facility continually seeks ways to improve its prevention and response programs.\n\nThis document, the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the facility, was prepared to comply with federal regulatory requirements regarding the prevention of accidental chemical releases (40 CFR Part 68 Accidental Release Prevention Requirements).  The purpose of the regulation is to reduce the potential for an accidental chemical release and strengthen emergency response planning at the facility and within the community.  The RMP describes the incident at the facility which would have the most catastrophic effects (\"the worst case\") and several scenarios of lesser magnitude (\"alternative cases\").  Although it is highly unlikely for the worse case described in the report to occur, worst case information is provided to support conservative emergency response planning.  In this way, the community is well prepared to respond to the lesser magnitude scenarios which are more likely to occur.\n\nAreas that could be impacted by an accidental chemical release were identified using PHAST software.  PHAST is a very sophisticated, EPA-recognized program specifically designed for accidental chemic"

Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n-PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)-\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR for any new process or process modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that process safety management and accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n-MECHANICAL INTEGRITY-\n\nThe facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that the new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n-SAFE WORK PRACTICES-\n\nBASF Corporation requires its facilities to develop safe work practices (SWPs) to define controls and procedures that must be followed in specific non-routine work situations that, if not controlled properly, could pose unnecessary threats to BASF personnel, contractors, the plant equipment, or the public.  These situations include activities such as hot work (e.g., flame- or spark-producing activities), confined space entry, opening process equipment, etc.  In some cases, these safe work practices are also required by specific federal and state regulations.\n\nThese safe work practices apply to both BASF employees and contractors that work in covered process areas at the Kankakee Plant.\n\nAlthough there are numerous SWPs that the Kankakee Plant has developed to help ensure the safety of personnel, the min"

Production Area Entry Procedure\n\n-MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE-\n\nThe Management of Change (MOC) system is intended to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental impact of all modifications to processes, equipment, chemicals, organizations and procedures are identified reviewed, approved and communicated prior to the implementation of the change.\n\nThe MOC procedure does not apply to (1) repairs or replacement-in-kind (RIK), (2) changes in operating conditions that do NOT exceed previously defined safe operating limits, and (3) normal startup, shutdown, or clean-out activities covered by previously reviewed and approved operating, maintenance, or safe work practice procedures.  For example, to return a piece of equipment to its original design specification does not require MOC as long as the change does not alter the design or operation of a process. \n\n-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION-\n\nIncident investigation is the process of identifying the underlying cause of an incident and taking corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  The Kankakee Plant will investigate each incident, which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical.  The incident investigation will be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  Documentation of an incident and the subsequent investigation must be entered into the AIM's database as soon as practical after the incident occurs.\n\n-COMPLIANCE AUDITS-\n\nThe Kankakee Plant adheres to the BASF BMP-004 Audit Management Process to verify that the procedures and practices at the site comply with all requirements of regulation 40 CFR 68 and are being consistently followed.  \n\n-CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS-\n\nIn addition to the general accident prevention program described above, the Kankakee facili"
