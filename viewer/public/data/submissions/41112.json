It is the Company's policy to minimize\nnegative impact upon both groups by maintaining a constant vigil\non its operations, with planning and prevention being essential\ncomponents of its efforts.\n\nThe employee's appreciation of the dangers associated with\nanhydrous ammonia begins during New Employee Orientation and\ncontinues throughout the term of employment.  Empolyees are major\nstakeholders in safe operations and are actively involved in\ndeveloping and implementing the PSM Program.  Periodic, timely\ntraining emphasizing concepts needed to ensure personal safety and\nproper reaction to emergency situations further demonstrates the\nCompany's commitment to safe operations.  In-plant monitoring of\nkey areas provides a safe work environment along with adequate\nwarning of any threat to employees' safety; changes in operation\nrequire evaluation of relevant safety issues.\n\nThe public is well served through the Company's close involvement\nwith local emergency response organizations.  Plant management\nworks with incident response personnel as needed.  Public\nnotification procedures have been developed.\n\nThe Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been completed for\npresent operating conditions for plant personnel information only.\n\nEmployee awareness might be the single most important factor in\nminimizing accidental releases to the atmosphere, and the Company\nstrives to keep awareness levels at the highest by mandating\nperiodic employee training.  Staff are actively involved with\nprograms designed to protect the work environment - the PSM\nProgram, for example, provides a"

The Safety Committee has a long history of\nactive involvement on behalf of the employees and the employer.\nEquipment designs employ \"Best Engineering Practices\" and\nconservative safety factors.

There has not been a notable\naccidental release of ammonia during the past fifteen years.\nStill, plans to constantly review and improve performance are in\nplace.  A recent audit of the PSM Program identified several ways\nin which our operations could be improved, and the Company reacted\npositively to those suggestions.  Standard operating procedures\nare reviewed periodically.  Management of Change analyses precede\ninstallation of new equipment.
