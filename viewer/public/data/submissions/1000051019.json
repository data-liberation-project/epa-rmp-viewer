This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\n\n\nEmployees who enter Zybach Plant complete thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help keep operators' problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\n\n\nThe Zybach Plant, located in rural Wheeler County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from field gas.  The inlet gas stream enters the plant through pipeline(s) and flows through liquid separation equipment which separates raw condensate and produced water from the gas.  The separated gas stream from the liquids separation equipment flows through the molecular sieve gas dehydration desiccant beds, which removes the water from the gas before it flows into the cryogenic NGL recovery unit.  The NGL recovery unit lowers the gas temperature to begin processed recovery of NGL consisting of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes.  The separated NGL is stored in one (1) 45,000 gallon pressurized tank and exits the site via pipeline(s).  The residue gas stream from the cryogenic NGL recovery unit is compressed before flowing off-site through gas sales pi"

The facility consists of multiple small lube oil, waste oil, condensate and fuel tanks and their associated piping, valves, pumps, and compressors on site that support the compressor station as well as the NGL tanks.  As such, the Zybach Plant is classified as a Program 3 RMP facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5-year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n&#8195;\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nAs specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquids in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Zybach Plant, this would involve our 45,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (150,518 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade; calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,100 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1,050 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPAs RMP*Comp &trade;, which is known to be highly conservative and should over predict any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our 45,000 gallon NGL bullet tank due to a four inch puncture of the tank and a release of 98,200 pounds of"

As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted in conspicuous locations to provide constant reminders to the drivers about proper unloading techniques.  Barriers are in place to prevent trucks from hitting tanks.  Additonally, Zybach Plant has a driving plan that communicates safe driving practices to all plant visitors.  This alternative scenario also covers any process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds. \n\n\n\nMidcoast has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Wheeler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Zybach Plant.  Because the processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and are also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM), this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Zybach Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.

These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.). \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Zybach Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Zybach Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.

Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Zybach Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \n\n\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nContractors:  Zybach Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  Zybach Plant has established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices:  Zybach Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.
