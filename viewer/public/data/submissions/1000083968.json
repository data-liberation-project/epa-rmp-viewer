      "SummaryText": "RMP 2014 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR PEDDIE CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC.\n\n\n\nPeddie Chemical is a small business which is a distributor for janitorial cleaning chemicals, janitorial equipment, paper products, and industrial chemicals.  We do not manufacture any chemicals on site.  Our products are packaged before arrival at our facility.  The regulated substance that we handle is chlorine.  The maximum inventory at any one time is sixty (60) 150# cylinders of chlorine gas (9000#).  The cylinders are received by ground transportation in containment racks and are removed from the truck by forklift and placed in our warehouse.   Upon receiving an order for a cylinder(s), the cylinder is placed on the Peddie Chemical truck for delivery to the customer.   We are not responsible for  connecting or disconnecting cylinders for our customers.  If a customer receives a cylinder that later develops a leak, the customer will call us to report the problem.  If the problem occurs when the office is closed, we contract with Infotrac for emergencies.  Infotrac's 800 number is printed on each invoice.  If the problem occurs during business hours, a trained Peddie Chemical Co. employee would assist the customer.  We have personal respirator equipment and the Chlorine Emergency Kit \"A\" for handling small or minor leaks.  If the situation requires attention in which our employees are not trained, we would then call Allied Universal Corporation to assess the situation and remove the cylinder.  \n\n\n\nPeddie Chemical Company is required to comply with the rules and reulations of OSHA 29 CFR, DOT 49 CFR 172.704, EPA 40 CFR Part 68 and Florida State EPCRA.  This facility is operated in accordance with the recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.  There have been no accidents to report for the last five years.  \n\n\n\nOur facility's Emergency Response Plan is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  We are coordinated with Homeland Security, the S"

Although our employees are trained to handle minor leaks in cylinders, we are a Non-Responding Facility and would depend upon local response agencies in the event of a major chemical release.           \n\n\n\nWe will continue to seek training from various sources such as OSHA consultation services, the Chlorine Institute, and Allied Universal Corporation to ensure the safety of our employees and the community."
