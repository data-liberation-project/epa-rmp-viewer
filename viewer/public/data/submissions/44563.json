Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at the City of Sweet Home Wastewater Treatment Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the affects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Sweet Home "

The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine that is expected to be present in this facility is <4,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequences analysis for our facility, we have used the lookup tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Wastewater Treatment Plant's chlorine supply system.  The scenario involves the release of 4,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 600.  A distance to endpoint of 1.6 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 499 within this distance.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative Case Analysis:\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario involves a catastrophic release from the piping from a chlorine ton container to the chlorinator.  The scenario involves the release of 10 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 1 and a distance to endpoint of .1 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 6.\n\n\n\nThere are no flammables Worst Case or Alternative Case Analysis for this facility.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  One process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification req"

The methodology used to carry out these analysis is the What-if Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operations involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are properly trained in the procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification of process conditions, are promptly made aware of, and offered, training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews related to new processes and to modifications of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits:\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\n\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.
