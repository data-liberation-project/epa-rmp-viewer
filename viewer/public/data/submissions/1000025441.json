Martinelli & Company utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a juice making facility in Watsonville, CA.  Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\n\n\nThe S. Martinelli & Company facility has a fixed refrigeration system consisting of reciprocating compressors, glycol chillers, evaporative condensers, pressure vessels, room coils and diffusion tank. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves for high pressure situations.  There is a ammonia detector in the mechanical room for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\n\n\n\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2.    Description of Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used for room cooling and glycol chilling as part of the juice making process.  The refrigeration system is a single stage vapor compression cycle.    The refrigeration system consists of the following equipment: two compressors, two surge drums, two high pressure receivers, three low pressure receivers, one evaporative condensers, two glycol chillers and a diffusion tank.  There are also automatic controls for the system.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Saf"

      "SummaryText": "ety Inspection Checklists, describe equipment details. A complete set of system drawings are included in RMP along with drawings showing the location of the facility, overall site plan, and equipment layout.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may cause suffocation, as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain, and serious skin burn. A Material Safety Data sheet (MSDS) for ammonia is included in Appendix C. Written in both Spanish and English, the MSDS details the chemical properties and health hazards of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nS. Martinelli & Company maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. Incident Investigation Program is inplace to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release. A Risk Management Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with RMP.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system.  Ammonia detection is installed in the mechanical room.  Personnel will automatically be notified if the detector exceeds set point.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day.  All rel"

      "SummaryText": "ief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The Hazmat Team Chief will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.  \n\n\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nAccording to S. Martinelli & Company Personnel, since startup there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n6.    Planned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA and safety inspection are listed as Hazard Mitigation Recommendations in RMP. All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
