The Facilty Policy\n\nThe owners, management, abd employees of Cross Plains Grain & Peanut, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  local firedepartment, the local emergency planning committee, or other authorities, to mitigate and release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is storage to farmers.\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received,stored, and distributed for direct applicatin as fertilizer\nfor crop production nutrients.\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 133,000 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage\n tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum would be 133,000\n pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85 percert capacity as limited\n by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\n ppm) is 2.4 miles in a rural area.\n     b.  The alternate release scenario,  based on the most likely poteneial incident, is a \n release from a break in a hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to\n 200 ppm) is .6 miles in a rural area.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program.\n\n  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", publishes by The American National Standards\nInstitute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S.Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.
