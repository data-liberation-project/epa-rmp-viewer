      "SummaryText": "The Naval Station Norfolk, VA, is the largest Naval Station in the world. It is located 18 miles from the Atlantic Ocean and lies approximately 90 miles southeast of Richmond. The base is home to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Distribution Norfolk, Virginia. The DLA Distribution provides standard packing operations, specialized storage operations, cold storage warehousing as well as hazardous material packing and shipping. The majority of their workload comes from supplying the Navy's Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets, Atlantic bases, and numerous shore establishments. The DLA Distribution also serves as a supply point for a portion of the Navy that supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and provides humanitarian efforts in the United States, the Caribbean, and other countries.\n\nThe DLA Distribution cold storage facility is located in building CEP-156 on the southwest portion of the Sewell's Point Area of the Naval Base Norfolk.  Since the last RMP 5-year update submission on 10 August 2006, there have been some modifications. These modifications include the reduction of the amount of ammonia in the system as a result of removing the ammonia equipment/piping in Rooms 100 and 200.  Since the submission of the original RMP, the calculated maximum quantity has been revised to 9,850 lbs of ammonia at CEP-156.  Because the 9,850 lbs maximum quantity of ammonia is near the 10,000 lbs limit, the facility has chosen to remain a registered RMP facility. Therefore, the Cold Storage Warehouse is subject to the requirements of Section I 12(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. \n\nThe prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration process mirrors the OSHA PSM requirements and consists of a combination of engineering controls and administrative procedures. An example of this would be the safety relief valves on the compressors, which are designed to release if the pressure reaches an unsafe level. Since the original RMP, the ammonia monitoring system has been "

The 2005 PHA for DLA Distribution's ammonia refrigeration process revealed no significant additional safety issues that need to be addressed and only minor corrections were made to information provided in the previous PHA.  The 2010 PHA Re-validation identified twenty-six (26) additional recommendations.  All twenty-six (26) recommendations have been completed by DLA Distribution.\n\nA RMP compliance audit was conducted on 22-24 April 2009.  After a review of their current operations, DLA Distribution was found to be in compliance with current RMP regulations.  \n\nOn 6 July 2010, a team consisting of HDR|eA?M (HDR), Professional Safety Associates (PSA), and ENGlobal finalized a report of their safety and engineering evaluation of DLA Distribution Norfolk, Virginia, Cold Storage Plant, Building CEP-156. The main purpose of the safety evaluation was to determine if the ammonia chiller plant was being operated to ensure the protection of life, health, property and the environment as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's RMP.  \n\nIn accordance with the Emergency Response Program, employees of CEP-156 are not the first responders in the event of an ammonia release. The Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department is notified if an ammonia alarm goes off at 35 ppm within the facility. The Naval Station Norfolk Fire Department has the proper equipment and training in place to respond to an ammonia emergency or release at the Cold Storage Warehouse.  The Fire Department personnel periodically review the emergency response procedures and they are continuously trained a"
