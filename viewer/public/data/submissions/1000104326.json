      "SummaryText": "e Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant is coordinated with the Midland Fire Department. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant.\n\n* No changes are planned."

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Fire eyes\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n*Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases.\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\n*Atmospheric relief devices. \n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for th"

Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 1 facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant.  The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Taylor-Leiker Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Feat"
