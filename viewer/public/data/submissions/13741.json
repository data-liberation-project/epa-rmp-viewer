This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass loading/unloading and storage of propellants used in the aerosol and foaming industries.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane and Butane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.  Butane is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 399750.00 lb. while Propane and Butane are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 335500.00 lb. and 323750.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Normal Butane.  In this scenario 145000 lb. of Butane is rel"
