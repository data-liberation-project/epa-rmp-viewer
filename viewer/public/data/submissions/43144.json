Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Peterson's North Branch Mill in Cambridge, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee,\npublic, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive\naccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nWe coordinate our response efforts with the Cambridge Fire Department, which provides additional\nemergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, twenty-nine 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in\nCambridge, Minnesota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored 85% standard maximum storage\ncapacity is 50,150 gallons (258,071.9 pounds) including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The\nlargest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at  85% standard maximum\nstorage capacity.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
