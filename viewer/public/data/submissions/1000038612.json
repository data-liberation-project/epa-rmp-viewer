      "SummaryText": "The Cargill Meat Solutions facility in Columbus, Nebraska is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" found in Title 40 part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule. The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity.\n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years. The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity. The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement. The RMP will be made available to the public. The purpose of this project was to compile an updated RMP.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that a vessel failure would result in a release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp. The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 1.2 miles. It was further determined that within 1.2 miles of the facility there is a population of 1,624 people. There were no public receptors identified within 1.2 miles of the facility other than the residences and the Loup River Canal area.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia resulting from a failure during normal operation"

      "SummaryText": ". This is the same vessel as examined in the worst-case release. However, for the alternative release scenario the quantity released is based on the more realistic normal operating inventory of the vessel rather than the largest quantity that may ever be present in the vessel. In this scenario, 28.9 pounds of ammonia are released over a 10-minute period. The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.1 miles. The population within 0.1 miles of the facility was determined to be zero. There were no public or environmental receptors identified within 0.1 miles of the facility.  Other alternative release scenarios considered included a transfer hose release, piping failures, and other relief valve failures in open or in a relief condition.  Also considered for alternate release scenarios were cracks and leaks in pressure vessels or pumps and plug and drain failures.  These scenarios were determined to have less impact or be less likely to occur than the selected scenario.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses data and information concerning the facility and the facility's implementation of the risk management program are included in the risk management plan documented in this report.\n\n\n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this facility has not had any accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan in place to provide a limited emergency response to a release situation. A hazmat team is available on site to respond to emergency releases. The facility also coordinates Platte County Civil Defense and District 4 LEPC to respond to emergency releases. The facility is included in the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nThe Cargill Meat Solutions facility is continuously working to improve process safety at the facility. Fa"
