      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\nThe Tenaska Alabama Partners II, LP Central Alabama Generating Station in Autauga County, Alabama handles anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The toxicity of ammonia at high concentrations make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the personal health of our emplyoyees as well as nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe primary purpose of the generating station is to produce electric power from combustion of natural gas.  Fuel oil may be used as an alternative fuel.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to reduce the formation of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced during combustion.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored as a liquid under pressure in a single storage tank.  The ammonia is transported by pipeline, from storage and injected into the combustion system where it reacts with the natural gas combustion products to minimize NOx formation.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by EPA is the release of the full contents of the largest ammonia storage vessel within 10 minutes with simultaneous failure of all control and mitigation systems and at a time when weather conditions would cause the maximum downwind transport distance.  At Tenaska, the worst-case release would be a catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage"

      "SummaryText": " tank when filled to capacity.  This worst-case scenario would relese 78,800 pounds of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor within 10 minutes of the failure.  The distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14 mg/l ammonia for this worst-case scenario is 5.1 miles.\n\nThe more realistic alternative-case release would be the failure of a 2-inch diameter anhydrous ammonia fill pipeline.  This scenario would result in a total release of 36 pounds of ammonia.\nThe distance to the end-point concentration of 0.14 mg/l ammonia for this alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Tenaska generating station compllies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable ammonia storage and handling codes.  All employees involved with the operation or maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system are thoroughly trained using Tenaska's documented training program.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\nNo accidental releases of ammonia causing on-site or off-site injury or damage have occurred during the life of this facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\nTenaska's emergency response program is based upon an accidental release of ammonia.  We have discussed this program with the Autauga County Emergency Management Agency and the local Fire Department."
