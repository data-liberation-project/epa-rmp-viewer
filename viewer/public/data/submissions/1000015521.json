There have been no major expansions or reportable releases during this time. \n\n\n\nOur RM Program contains the following major steps:\n\nRegistration, Executive Summary, Management System, 5-year Accident History, Hazard Assessments, Process Hazard Analysis, Accident Prevention Program, and Emergency Action Program\n\n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \n\n\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Lyons Magnus are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training demonstrates this commitment.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale storage and processing of frozen fruits, syrups and canned products.  This activity is consistent with SIC 2037/ NAICS 311411 fruits frozen manufacturing. Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to use as a refrigerant. Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system.  The calculated inventory of ammonia at our facility is over 10,000 lbs. in 5 independent refrigeration processes. Only Plant 5 is > 10,000 lbs, Plant 4 is between 500 and 10,000 lbs., and 3 smaller systems are less than 500 lbs.. The safety systems include Redundant Electronic Control Systems, Safety Relief Valves connected to Ammonia diffusion tank, NH3 detection"

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \"The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived there from for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\"\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  To perform the required offsite consequence analyses for other substances we have used.  Details are not provided in the Executive Summary as required in recent rulemaking.\n\n\n\nAlternate case scenario has also been evaluated and included. \n\n\n\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with 2001 Ca Mechanical code.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLyons Magnus maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\n\n\n \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our pro"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Lyons Magnus maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nLyons Magnus has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLyons Magnus carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel or Refrigeration Contractors with a strong background in maintenance practices.  Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Lyons Magnus to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLyons Magnus conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLyons Magnus promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. Any incidents that release a reportable amount of Ammonia require updating the 5 year Accident History and filing a revised RMP with the EPA.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLyons Magnus truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nAt Lyons Magnus Hot Work Permit procedures are in place and enforced.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Lyons Magnus has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.Five-year Accident History\n\nLyons Magnus has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period at our previous Cold Storage facility. Any reportable release requires updating the Accident History within 6 months.\n\n\n\n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nLyons Magnus has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is regularly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. Any changes in Emergency Contact information is reported within 30 days.\n\n\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. This includes additional labels of hazardous piping, identification of ammonia equipment, additional NH3 detection, external emergency controls, and seismic changes.  These changes should be implemented in 2015. We have also coordin"
