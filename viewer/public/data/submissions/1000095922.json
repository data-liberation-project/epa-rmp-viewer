Nevertheless, Rio Vista continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Rio Vista's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Rio Vista's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nRio Vista has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Rio Vista has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Rio Vista now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Rio Vista employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Rio Vista will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
