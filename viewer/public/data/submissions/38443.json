KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Taft Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and ships and stored until it is loaded on to barges or ships for distribution or injected into the pipeline for delivery at another facility.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Taft Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Propane is stored at the facility; however, it is used strictly as a fuel and as such is exempt from RMP reporting.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for b"

These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Taft Terminal is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots.\n?Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a backup flare in the unlikely event of the main flare going out.\n?Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system and the flare system by having a backup power generator.\n?Emergency shutdown buttons at the barge and ship loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the ship/barge crew in case of an ammonia release.\n?Surge bladders on the ship/barge loading lines to absorb the shock during sudden closure of the valve due to emergency shutdown.\n?A fire water deluge system on top of the largest ammonia tanks.\n?Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition monitoring system if the threshold for ammonia is exceeded.\n?Fire water"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the St. Charles Parish Hospital Ambulance Service, the Louisiana State Police, and the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Taft Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, con"

The terminal coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the parish on an ongoing basis."
