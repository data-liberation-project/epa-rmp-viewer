      "SummaryText": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities that process more than a threshold quantity of certain listed hazardous substances to develop and implement a risk management program, and to submit a summary of their risk management program to the EPA. The facility is covered by the rule because it uses anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory threshold. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity. Initially, the summary document, called the Risk Management Plan (RMP), had to be submitted to the EPA by June 21, 1999.\n\n\n\nThe facility is resubmitting an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the regulatory requirement to fully update the RMP at least once every five years. The purpose of this project was to prepare the RMP update for the Dodge City, KS facility.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on the FAB Controlled Pressure Receiver. The FAB controlled pressure receiver is the largest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration process. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumes that 48,347 pounds of ammonia are released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's general guidance document for risk management programs, and confirmed by EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 2.4 miles. It was further determined that within 2.4 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 10 people. The public receptors identified within 2.4 miles of the facility are residences, correctional facility, recreational areas, commercial/industrial areas, rivers, and schools. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia from a pressure relief valve on the SLA High Side Accumulator. For the alternative release scenario, it was assumed that the v"

There is no residential population within the calculated distance to endpoint. There were also no other public or environmental receptors identified within 0.2 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuation, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe updated report includes updated prevention program review dates and other activities associated with the prevention program."
