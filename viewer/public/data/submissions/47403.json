It is the policy of PXP that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, PXP strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  PXP has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., personnel training, safety consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  The company?s philosophy is to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as non-regulated substances. \n  \nThe company activates its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environmental are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is located, approximately 12 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 1.5 miles northeast of Vandenberg Village.  The nearest public road is Harris Grade Road, approximately 0.25 miles to the west.  The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private property.  The facility is fenced an"

The Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is a relatively small industrial operation, occupying The Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant is a relatively small industrial operation, occupying approximately 20 acres and consists of a Program 3 process.  The facility receives incoming crude oil and gas from an offshore platform (including some gas from onshore fields) and then utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids for product.  The incoming oil is processed in the oil treating portion of the facility where water and other contaminates are separated from the crude oil before it is shipped via pipeline to a refinery for further processing.  The incoming gas is treated by removing water, hydrogen sulfide, and other heavy hydrocarbon components.  The hydrocarbon liquids which are separated out are sent to pressure vessels for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors.  The dry natural gas from the process is sold as a product.  \n\n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  There are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the federal threshold quantities.\n\n1.4  Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n1.4.1  Worse-Case Release Scenario- Flammable\n\nThe worse-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is often less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  \n\nThe worse-case release scenario model"

Per 40CFR68.25(b)(1), the greatest amount held in a single vessel shall be used to determine the worst-case release quantity.  The worse-case release scenario redone for the June 2004 update did not identify any off site impacts and no residential, environmental, or public receptors. \n\n1.4.2  Flammable Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a release of a flammable mixture which results in a vapor cloud fire.  The alternative release scenario also redone for the 2004 update did not identify any off site impacts and no residential, environmental, or public receptors.\n\n1.5  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is subject to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions) Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\nCompliance with PSM?s comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable materials.  The objective of the company?s PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, PXP has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following "

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.  PSM is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment. \n\n1.6  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to implementing the PSM elements, the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant utilizes specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases of regulated (and other) substances.  Control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant include:\n\n?Relief and/or safety valves\n?High temperature alarms and/or shutdowns\n?Flame detectors \n?Combustible Gas Detectors\n?Smoke Detectors\n?Hydrogen Sulfide Monitors\n?Fire Protection System\n?Emergency Shutdown Systems (ESD)\n?Leak Detection System \n\n1.7  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents with off-site impacts involving a regulated substance as defined in the regulation at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant in the past five years. \n\n1.8  Emergency Response Program Summary\n\nPXP developed written emergency response procedures to address all elements that may be encountered during planning, response or follow-up of an emergency at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.

In addition, the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms. \n\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), and the emergency response element of PSM.  The basic concepts of these emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n1.9  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a requirement of Santa Barbara County, PXP has performed a Best Available and Safest Technology (BAST) audit of the Lompoc Oil & Gas Plant.  The BAST requirement states that production operations (oil & gas) use the best available and safest technologies wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment.  The results of the audit indicate that ?the facility is in compliance with the letter and spirit of the BAST regulation.?  The audit findings and recommendations are to be reviewed by the Santa Barbara County Systems Safety and Reliability Review Committee for comment."
