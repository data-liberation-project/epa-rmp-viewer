The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies set in place that Hoosier Energy is committed to providing a safe environment for its employees, contractors, visitors, neighbors, and surroundings.  This includes the prevention of accidental releases of any substance as well as the regulated substance: Sulfur Dioxide.  Hoosier Energy has several policies in place to provide guidance and training for maintaining a safe environment. In the event of a release or emergency, Hoosier Energy has established a Standard Operating Procedure for emergency responses. Hoosier Energy has dedicated bulletin #24 in the Manual of Administrative Bulletins to Corporate Safety and Health Policy. The plant has additional policies in place to provide safety and training. Additional training and safety procedures have been established in response to bringing Sulfur Dioxide to the plant site.\n\n2. Facility Information\nThe Frank E. Ratts Station consists of two nearly identical 116 MW coal-fired units placed in operation in 1970. The Station is located approximately three (3) miles northeast of Petersburg, IN on State Highway 57. Each unit has a Brown-Boveri turbine generator, a Riley Stoker wall-fired dry bottom boiler, and a cold side Belco Pollution Control Corporation electrostatic precipitator. The units were equipped with a Low NOx Burner System supplied by Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation (FWEC), two rows, four burners per row. \nIn an effort to further reduce emissions from the plant site a new emission control technology (MOBOTEC) is being tested on a trial basis to determine if the proper reduction of emissions can be obtained.  The new technology will consist of a fan system which will create a pattern in the furnace to reduce NOx by lowering the flame temperature and distributing it.  The other phase of the project involves injecting limestone dust into new ports in the furnace, which utilizes a chemical reaction to reduce the sulfur dioxide.  The increase in "

      "SummaryText": "particulate loading will be collected by conditioning the flue gas prior to the Electrostatic Precipitator.  The chemical, Sulfur Dioxide, will be vaporized and injected to condition the flue gas. Ammonia will also be vaporized and injected in separate ports to further condition the flue gas. The sulfur dioxide will be consumed at approximately 113 lbs/ hr. \n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case scenario we modeled is for the release of three of the SO2 cylinders. The cylinders of Sulfur Dioxide are located in an enclosed room. The room is the fan inlet to the boiler so if there is a leak as long as the fans are operating the gas will be sucked into the boiler and burnt. Since the fan room is common to both units the SO2 gas would be sucked into the either Unit 1 or Unit 2 furnace.  In the event the furnace is not operating the gas would be partially contained in the enclosed room. Natural draft would pull the gas out of the room and disperse it up the stack. We modeled the release of three of the 1-ton cylinders as they will be connected to a common manifold. The release of 6,000 lbs of Sulfur Dioxide would disperse approximately 1.6 miles. However with the enclosed room and the fan draft or natural draft the possibility of the gas escaping is very unlikely.  Thus, we are submitting data showing the gas will be contained and not dispersed.  An affected area of 0.1 miles and no residents would be affected. The plant site sits on a river which the public has access to and travels on. A leak would not disperse to the river, but up the natural draft or fan draft into the furnace. \n\n4. Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative Release Scenario would consist of a connection to the manifold leaking or the piping leaking. This scenario is most unlikely to happen, however the leak would be in the fan intake room and sucked into the furnace and burnt.  A leak of the connections would result in the same scenario as any other leak with the gas being sucked into the"

Thus, as with the worst case scenario the affected distance would be less than 0.1 miles and no affected residents. \n\n5. Five Year Accident History\nThe Ratts Station has had no reportable accidents in the past five years. \n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\nThe emergency response to a Sulfur Dioxide release will be to notify authorities through the 911 system. The plant supervisors have been trained to notify plant personnel and other on site personnel of the evacuation or shelter in place response. Public notification will be to utilize the Reverse 911 system for residential population. \n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvements and training will be an ongoing process. Several policies were updated to cover the Sulfur Dioxide being brought on to the plant site. Process control equipment changes and technology will be evaluated as needed."
