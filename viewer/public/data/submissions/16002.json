If an accidental release would occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of  the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity of the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and utilized in the batch operation for production of ammmonium phosphate fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 50,000 pounds in our 16,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a delivery truck holding 40,000  pounds.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank when being filled from a tanker truck released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximun quantity released would be 40,000 pounds which represent the volume of the tanker truck.  Ammonia is only ordered as needed.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.6 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from discharging ammonia from a break in the reactor or transfer hoses.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 mile.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American Health Standards Institute, Inc.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no acidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, no off-site consequences.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has 1.) provi"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance of the equipment to insure safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at the time."
