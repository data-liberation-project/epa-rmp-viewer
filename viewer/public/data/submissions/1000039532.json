As part of our continuous improvement efforts, the Facility reviews the effectiveness of these procedures on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nWe have developed and implemented an Emergency Response Program.  The program is documented in the Site's Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The purpose of the Emergency Response Program is to specify how Facility personnel will respond to emergencies of: fire, ammonia release, other chemical release, bomb or other criminal activity threat, severe weather, severe injury or illness, and power outage. \n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe only regulated substance triggering the need for this RMP is ammonia.\n\n\n\nVentura Foods, Ontario Facility, operates a closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  Because the anhydrous ammonia inventory exceeds the federal and state thresholds, a Risk Management Plan (RMP) is required. The Facility recognizes that this system presents certain risks to the safety of its employees and neighbors, as well as to the environment, and that procedures are required to identify and analyze those risks, and then to use that analysis to minimize the risks.  In addition, the Facility recognizes that, as an operator of this system, we have obligations.  \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Steps\n\n\n\nThe key components of the "

To implement this policy, the Facility has identified potential hazards and implemented operating procedures and other controls (engineering and administrative). We periodically evaluate the effectiveness of these controls in a manner specifically designed to enable continuous improvement of the ammonia refrigeration management program.\n\n\n\n? The Facility has prepared and adopted a Contractor EHS Management Program.  Key to this program is the reinforcement of the need for requisite contractor qualifications and training, as well as improved company procedures to track and document contractor qualifications and performance.\n\n    \n\n? As part of its implementation of the RMP, the Facility has Mechanical Integrity procedures to ensure that identified risks associated with ammonia refrigeration equipment are properly assessed and managed as part of regular maintenance practices pursuant to manufacturer and industry standards.  As part of its continuous improvement efforts, the Facility will review the effectiveness of these procedures on an annual basis. \n\n \n\n? VF has trained and educated all departments of the Ontario Facility in their respective responsibilities for risk identification and reduction.  In particular, the partnership between the Maintenance Department, EHS Department and Management has been emphad to ensure cohesive and effective implementation of all EHS program requirements.\n\n\n\n? The Facility has reviewed and revised its hazardous material release reporting program (an important sub-part of its Emergency Action Plan) in order to ensure timely and accurate reporting to all responsible agencies.\n\n\n\n? As part of the development of the RMP, the Facility has re-evaluated likely areas of risk and revised this RMP to ensure that risk identification, and associated hazard reduction planning, is both expansive and regularly updated.

Training is one of the keys to proper employee and contractor compliance with RMP requirements.  Consistent with fact, the Facility has revised and renewed employee and contractor training as part of the RMP improvement and implementation process.\n\n\n\n?
