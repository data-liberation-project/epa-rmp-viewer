General accidental release and prevention policy of The Dannon Company.\n\nIn this yogurt processing facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\nthe environment.  \nIt is our policy at The Dannon Company to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nThe Dannon Company, Inc., 1300 Petersmith Street, Fort Worth, Texas, operates a refrigeration\nsystem utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a\nthermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to\nmaintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of\nevaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and\nexpansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle\nis a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, press"

The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a\ndesired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\n\nThe Dannon Company facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain processing, storage room\nand product tank temperatures required for the processing and storage of our product. There are\napproximately 350 employees at this facility, including hourly and salary personnel, that\nmanufacture and prepare shipment of refrigerated dairy products via truck approximately 24\nhours a day, seven days a week.\n  \nThe refrigeration system contains 65,000 pounds of aggregate ammonia. The potential hazards\nthat could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment\nfailure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \n\n\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n3. Worst case  and alternate case release scenarios including administrative and\nengineering controls to limit/ prevent accidental release.\n\nWorst case scenario depicts continuous source leak from the High Pressure Receiver (HPR)\nlocated inside the screw machine room.  This vessels normal operating level is 16,000 pounds of\nliquid ammonia,  approximately 35% of it's total capacity. Although the high pressure receiver is\ncapable of holding 45,000 po"
