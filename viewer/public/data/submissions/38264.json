This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulationsin order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This RMP is also being filed with the local Administering Agency, Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations, California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.   \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSwim Chem's swimming pool maintenance facility is located at 4444 Auburn Blvd., Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, and maintains an inventory of chlorine for repackaging in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located in a commercial/residential area just south of Interstate 80.  There are 16 full-time employees at this site.  Chlorine is receive"

Liquid chlorine is withdrawn under pressure from a ton container to fill 20-lb. capacity transfer cylinders which are transported by Swim Chem employees to private swimming pools where the employees inject gaseous chlorine into the pools for maintenance of pool water quality.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Swim Chem that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Swim Chem has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Swim Chem are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nSwim Chem has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its repackaging process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Swim Chem's operations.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program will be used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention s"

It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies.  First Responders have participated with Swim Chem personnel in response drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which Swim Chem committed to accomplish have been completed.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
