The operation is 24/hours a day, (7) saven days a week with a total number of about 250 emplyees.                                                      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Extremely Hazardous substance stored at this facility. It is used in the refrigeration process. The freezer refrigeration system holds approximately 7,000 lb. of Anhydrous Ammonia, with the medium temperature system(dairy, produce, and receiving dock) system holding approximately 4,000lb. The (2) two systems are not connected.                                                                      The worst case scenario involving Anhydrous Ammonia would be an increase in system pressure resulting in a blow-off of pressure from a relief valve or a malfunctioning relief valve leaking pressure. There is a possibility of a pipe which holds Anhydrous Ammonia breaking do to human error, or some other factor which would release product until the system shut down. Approximately 1,000 lb. of Ammonia could be released if one of these scenarios would occur.                                                                                The potential for a release of this amount is highly unlikely due to the alarms and safety systems installed at this facility. The refrigeration systems have ammonia sensors, audible and visual alarms and emergency shut-down switches located outside the machine rooms near exit doors. The freezer refrigeration system has an automatic dialer, which calls refrigeration technician if there is a problem.                                           A release of 1,000 lb. of Anhyrdous Ammonia in a urban area would give .2 mile vulnerability zone. "

The primary emergency responders for a spill or leak are the Sheboygan County Haz-mat Team, Sheboygan Police Department, Sheboygan Fire Department, Orange Cross Ambulance and Kuhlman Refrigeration Contractor. The Sheboygan Fire Department has met with us to determine ways to minimize an event at the facility and have gathered additional information and factors to be taken into consideration should a spill occur. We do have chemical monitoring equipment at our facility such as: PH meters, Anhydrous Ammonia sensors and digital dialer. Personnel protective equipment includes Positive Pressure Respirators, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, Fully Encapsulated Suit, Boots and Gloves, Helemets and Eye Protection.  We do have a Posted  \"Ammonia Leak Action Plan\", in place, for both the Freezer Facility and the Produce, Dairy and Banana Rooms as follows:  What Constitutes A Problem With Ammonia?  Medium Temperature Area:  Ammonia by nature is a self alarming chemical as it is an irritant and at insignificant amounts causes discomfort to ones nasal passages. Installed in the Dairy cooler, Wet & Dry Produce Coolers, Banana Rooms, Receiving Dock and Machine Room is a manning Ammonia Detection System. The alarm system activates at 25 PPM which is within the limits of being able to work in that area for an (8) eight hour day. Freezer Facility: Installed in the Ammonia Machine Room, Receiving Dock and the Freezer Penthouse is a Manning Ammonia Detection System. The alarm activates at 25 PPM which is within the limits of being able to work in that area for an (8) eight hour day.  When Alarm Activates What Must I do?  Medium Temperature Areas:  When an alarm activates; A) Notify your supervisor immediately; B) if possible warn other employees in"
