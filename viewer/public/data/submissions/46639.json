To ensure\nefficient and effective management of our operations, we have developed a risk management program.  Our\nrisk management program manual, in its entirety, describes the specific responsibilities and activities for \nimplementing the risk management program.\n\nThe DWTP stores and uses chlorine to disinfect the community water supply.  The DWTP maintains\napproximately 4,000 pounds (two 1-ton containers) of chlorine on-site for use in its chlorination process.\n\nThe DWTP has not had any accidental releases of chlorine since it began operation.  The DWTP regularly \nconducts safety meetings to review and reinforce the proper management of our chlorine and chlorination\nsystem.  \n\nWorst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenarios were evaluated and distances to endpoints\nwere determined, public and environmental receptors were identified, and potentially affected populations were\nestimated.  The DWTP used the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance to determine the distances\nto endpoints.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the catastrophic release of the entire contents of the two 1-ton \ncontainers on-site.  For this to occur, the 1-ton containers would literally have to burst and instantaneously\nvaporize all of the liquid chlorine.  This worst-case release scenario is extremely unlikely.  Catastrophic\nvessel failure is a rare event.  In the event a worst-case release occurred, the release would potentially affect\nresidences, businesses, and a park in the surrounding community.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario was selected based on past history, probability of occurrence, and the ability\nto empact public and environmental receptors off-site.  While the DWTP does not have any history of \naccidents, the most likely cause of chlorine leaks is container va"

While this is not as unlikely of a \nrelease scenario as the worst-case release scenario, the DWTP takes precautions to minimize the occurrence\nof chlorine leaks.  Pipe breaks occur as a result of stressed or detoriated piping or poorly mated connections.\nThe DWTP has installed PVC piping which is resistant to corrosion by the chlorine gas and examines all\nchlorine piping regularly.  In the event that a pipe break occurs, the release would potentially affect residences\nand the surrounding community within 0.3 miles of the DWTP.\n\nThe City of Three Rivers believes that a comprehensive prevention program is essential to the prevention of\naccidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  The DWTP includes seven basic elements in its prevention \nprogram; a safety program, a hazard review program, written operating and maintenance procedures, a\ntraining program, incident investigation procedures, and a compliance audit program to ensure effectiveness\nof the risk management program.\n\nThe DWTP maintains complete and accurate written information cincerning process chemicals, process \ntechnology and process equipment, which is essential to an effective RMP.  The safety program consists of\nwritten information compiled for the chlorination process and up-to-date safety information, enabling the\nDWTP operators to identify and understand the potential hazards involved in the covered process.\n\nThe City of Three Rivers believes that a thorough hazard review is key to understanding how to operate \nsafely on a continual basis.  The DWTP has a hazard review process to determine, identify, and evaluate\nthe types of hazards or potential failures associated with the chlorination process.  The chlorination process\nis carefully managed and consistently conducted in a safe manner.\n\nWritten operatin procedures developed for the DWTP provide the safest and most appropriate step-by-"

The written operating procedures give operators clear instructions for\nsafely conducting activities involving the chlorination process.  These operating procedures include guidance\nfrom manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors of the chlorination process equipment. \n\nIn addition, the DWTP has implemented a maintenance procedures program that includes written procedures\nand schedules for maintenance and equipment inspections and tests to ensure that maintenance operations\nare conducted in a safe manner and implemented to maintain the mechanical integrity of the chlorination\nequipment.  Preventative maintenance and inspection of equipment is critical to safe operations.\n\nThe DWTP's training program is in place to ensure that its operators understand how to safely operate the\nchlorination equipment and to understand why safe operations are necessary.  The objective of this training is\nto train operators so that fewer accidents occur, equipment damage is minimized, and operational efficiency\nis improved.  The City of Three Rivers believes that its training program is the key to ensuring that the rest of\nthe Prevention Program is effective.\n\nEvery employee working with the chlorine will be adequately trained to ensure safe handling, storage, and use\nof the chlorine.  All personnel working at the DWTP receive taining on the operation and maintenance \nprocedures of the chlorination process.  Training consists of one-on-one training, on-the-job training, and\nclassroom training.\n\nThe DWTP has developed incident investigation procedures to investigate major and minor accidents that \noccur within the plant or across the fenceline that resulted in or could have resulted in a chemical release,\npersonnel injury, property damage, or environmental damage.

The\nDWTP uses the compliance audit program to verify that the practices and procedures developed are \nadequate and are being followed.\n\nThe City of Three Rivers DWTP has an Emergency Action Plan to ensure that the system for notifying employees,\nthe surrounding community, and the proper response authorities of in the event of an accidental release of \nhazardous chemicals is in effective and in place.  The DWTP operators are not trained nor equipped to respond,\nother that minor response, to a hazardous chemical release.  However, in the event that a release occurs that\nrequires any response other than a minor response, which can be safely performed by the City of Three\nRivers operators, the porper emergency response crews will be contacted.\n\nThe DWTP has implemented a management program, which describes the management responsibilities for\nimplementing the risk management program.  The management program was developed to ensure that the\nelements of the risk management plan are integrated, implemented, continuously improved, and that the\nresponsibility for the overall program and for each RMP requirement is clearly defined.\n\nThe City of Three Rivers' DWTP takes a very responsible attitude towards safety.  The DWTP has rigorously\nimplemented the risk management program.  The DWTP has continued its commitment to ongoing safety\nthrough the implementation of revised and updated operating and maintenance procedures and installation of\nupdated release detection equipment."
