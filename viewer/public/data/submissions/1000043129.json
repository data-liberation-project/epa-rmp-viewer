Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, exceeds the threshold quantity set by EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to manufacture hydrogen gas.  Hydrogen is used by our customer in their manufacturing process.  Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is mixed with steam and sent to the reformer furnace.  In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1500 degrees F, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon d"

Backup is provided by two storage tanks; (1) 20,000 gallon and (1) 15,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tank(s).  The regulated process at this facility is the hydrogen production (reformer) plant and the backup system.\r\n \r\nHydrogen is the only regulated substance handled at this facility in an amount exceeding the threshold quantity.  The combined maximum amount of hydrogen and hydrogen-containing flammable mixtures at this facility is 21,660 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year accident history:\r\n\r\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of, flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the Hoeganeaes Security and Safety Department for fires related to the flammable process.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \r\n \r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe fa"
