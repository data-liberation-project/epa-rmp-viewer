As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances and one toxic substance are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate, and hydrogen sulfide). There is approximately 1,920,000 lbs of flammable product stored in the storage process vessels on site. The facility does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels. However, the facility does remove and compress the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in the raw well head gas into an approved injection well outside of the plant boundary but on Steel Reef owned property (total of 1,384 lbs of H2S on site).\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulti"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, credit for administrative controls for maintaining a maximum of 90% level in the tank were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 mile, calculated using EPA's RMP*Comp software. No public and no environmental receptors were identified within the 0.50-mile radius, based on local operator reviews and knowledge. Past surveys included a residence; however, this location has since been abandoned and demolished.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the facility. Steel Reef has and maintains an operations management system (OMS) that covers all of its operating activities in the corporation. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant's PSM and accidental release prevention programs. These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.

These initiatives include facility safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, as well as equipment design basis and configuration information. Personnel from Steel Reef's corporate operations support team, Steel Reef Safety Team, and in conjunction with facility personnel, are assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the gas plant's operating procedures, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. Steel Reef primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study technique to perform these evaluations on its gas plant. The analysis is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs. Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary or would improve hazard management. The PHA team findings are addressed locally and by the company's Operations and Engineering teams for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, Lignite Gas Plant's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to specific process or equipment parameters that exceed the established safe upper and lower limits.  Operating procedures are readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lignite Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n"

The ERP changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and training affected personnel in the changes. \n\n\n\nThe overall ERP for the Lignite Gas Plant is coordinated with the Burke County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responder for plant emergencies is the Burke County Sheriff's Department and the Lignite Volunteer Fire Department. The Lignite Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Steel Reef's updated ERP will be finalized within next month followed by ERP Training.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Lignite Gas Plant will be the subject of a HAZOP study in 2020. Recommendations from the study will be handled in accordance with the procedures described above.\n\n"
