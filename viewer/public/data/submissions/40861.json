      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nWater District No. 1 of Johnson County operates a water treatment plant, which draws water from both the Missouri and Kansas Rivers.  The Hansen Water Treatment Plant consists of Facility No. 1, which is a 55 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant; and Facility No. 2, which is a 110 million gallon per day, lime-softening plant.  Facility No. 2 contains two separate chemical process areas.  In addition to the plant, there are two intake and presedimentation facilities, one at the Missouri River and one at the Kansas River.  These facilities will be covered in three separate Risk Management Plans.  One plan will cover the facilities at the Hansen Water Treatment Plant, and there will be a plan for each of the intake facilities. \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Section 112r regulated substances maintained at the Kansas River Intake and Presedimentation Facility, which will be referred to herein as the Facility.\n\nFacility Description\nThe Facility maintains only one regulated substance on site: chlorine.  Chlorine storage is 6,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.  The storage and management of chlorine is addressed in this RMP.  \n\nThe Facility is located at 8715 Holliday Drive, Kansas City, Kansas, which is in an urban area. \n\nProcess Hazard Assessment\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine system beginning with the unloading of the container and ending with the chlorine in solution.  A checklist and a modified \u00bfWhat if\u00bf analysis were used.  In the checklist analysis, general questions regarding the storage and use area, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorine system, were answered.  Following the checklist, each valve, line, and piece of equipment was assessed from the cylinder to point of chemical injection using a system flow diagram.  The valves and other points in the system where the chemical could be released are numbered on the flow diagram. The assessme"

      "SummaryText": "nt is formatted in accordance with those numbers.  Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system.  \n\nPrevention System\nThe Facility has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element of the chlorination system routinely.  There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the system.\n\nAs each cylinder is changed, the valves and flexible whip connection of the chlorine system are tested for leaks.  There are standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation.  Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  The system is equipped with chlorine detectors and alarms that indicate leaks.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nAny response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere requiring Level A personal protection or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by Haz-Mat Response Inc., an emergency response company located in the Kansas City area.  A copy of the relevant sections of Water District No. 1's Emergency Operations Plan is included.   \n\nAccident History\nThe Facility has had no chlorine releases in the past five years."
