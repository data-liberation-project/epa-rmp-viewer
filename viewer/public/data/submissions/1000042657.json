The city of Nashville's Department of Water and Sewerage Services (Metro Water Services) Risk Management Plan is a combination of technology, procedures, training and management.  Each element of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Risk Management program is addressed.  The approach is to prepare a plan tailored for each facility to increase knowledge, prevent accidents, and to respond to emergencies.\r\n\r\n2.  The Central Wastewater Treatment Plant has been in existence in its current location almost fifty six (56) years.  The plant is currently rated to treat a maximum capacity of 330 million gallons of wastewater each day.  It is now under expansion and several major expansions have been completed.  The facility is located in the downtown section of Nashville and encompasses approximately 160 acres.  The purpose is to treat the sewage from the south, central, and east sections of the city.  The water received at the plant as sewage is treated to remove the contaminants by a multi-step process known as activated sludge treatment.  The material removed from the water is called sludge or biosolids.  Each month the plant disposes of approximately 2,800 dry tons of biosolids.   The clean, clear water is then returned to the Cumberland River.  The final phase of treatment is chlorination, to disinfect the water and dechlorination to reduce the impact of the chlorine on the Cumberland.  The chlorine facility includes piping, valves, pressure gauges, evaporators, and chlorinators for chlorine.  It also has piping, valves, pressure gauges, evaporators, and  sulfinators for the declorination agent (sulfur dioxide).  Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are hazardous because they are respiratory irritants when inhaled.  Liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide are stored and used from ninety (90) ton rail cars.  Usually, two rail cars of each chemical are on site.  The amount of chemicals used"

The chlorine facility is normally guarded 24 hours a day seven days a week.  It is also monitored remotely from the plant control room.  The plant is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week and the operators visit the chlorine site at various times during the day.  Various types of safety equipment, alarms, sensors, and monitors are in place at this facility.     \r\n\r\n3.  Off site consequence analysis has been completed for each chemical.  Both the worse case and alternative release scenarios have been calculated using RMPcomp. The details of the analysis can be found in the obtained in the Metro Water Services Central WWTP RMP documentation.\r\n\r\n4.   The accident release prevention program for the Central Wastewater Treatment Plant includes the following:\r\n\r\na. Extensive operator training.\r\nb. Preventive Maintenance Program for the chlorine equipment.\r\nc. Use of state of the art process and safety equipment.\r\nd. Use of specific operating procedures written and reviewed by plant personnel.\r\ne. Scheduled performance reviews for hazards in the procedures and equipment.\r\nf. Implementation of a compliance inspection program.\r\n \r\n Presently, specific accident prevention measures include the following:\r\n \r\na. The site is monitored from the control room by two closed circuit cameras.\r\nb. Electronic leak detectors are in place which provide automatic shut off of the chemicals and audible and graphic alarms in the  control room and on site.\r\nc. Breathing air tanks and self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are available in the event of leaks and for personnel protection during connection/disconnection.\r\nd. Leak repair \"C\" kits with both chlorine and sulfur dioxide gaskets are on site at the facility. \r\ne. The building is marked with universal fire code hazard symbols.\r\n\r\n5.  No off site accidental releases have occurred at this plant in the last"
