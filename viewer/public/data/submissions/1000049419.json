      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nPurolite has developed a Risk Management Program and an Emergency Action Plan to address the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR 68.  Purolite is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  Purolite's staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and using 20% Oleum.\n\n\n\nPurolite has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the 20% Oleum system. Purolite's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nPurolite is located at 3620 G Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the county of Philadelphia. The primary activity at the Facility is the use of 20% Oleum to manufacture ion exchange resins.  Purolite's manufacturing process utilizes sulfonators, reactors, and dryers.  The 20% Oleum is stored in 8,000-gallon and 4,000-gallon vessels.  The maximum quantity of 20% Oleum in both vessels that is handled in this process is 177,045 pounds.  \n\n\n\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary and can be found in the Hazard Assessment report. \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of 20% Oleum has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Purolite has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-cr"

In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event, including the following:\n\n\n\n- Modeled using the highest temperature in the past three years.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a 20% Oleum release:\n\n\n\n- Containment area\n\n- Storage vessels are located inside building\n\n- The history of Purolite (i.e., no applicable releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely using 20% Oleum.\n\n\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Plan, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Purolite to manage process safety issues associated with the use of 20% Oleum. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n\n\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of the 20% Oleum is 177,045 pounds.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  As a result, the 20% Oleum covered process is subject to EPA RMP Program Level 3 and OSHA PSM. \n\n\n\nThe 20% Oleum Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\n\n-Process Safety Information\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n\n-Operating Procedures\n\n-Training\n\n-Mechanical Integrity\n\n-Management of Change\n\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n-Compliance Audits\n\n-Incident Investigation\n\n-Employee Participation\n\n-Hot Work Permit\n\n-Contractors\n\n\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program.

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of 20% Oleum at Purolite's facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPurolite employees are not First Responders.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Purolite will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. Purolite has filed a TRI Program to help coordinate with local responders.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPurolite is continually looking to improve the safety of its employees and the community by implementing any reasonable safeguards to reduce the risk of a potentially hazardous release. The facility currently meets and exceeds all requirement of 40 CFR 68 under the Clean Air Act and will continue to comply with any and all federal, state, and county regulations. \n\n\n\n8. Flammables: Worst Case\n\n\n\nThe use of flammable materials at Purolite is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\n\n\n9. Flammables: Alternative Release\n\n\n\nThe use of flammable materials at Purolite is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable\n\n"
