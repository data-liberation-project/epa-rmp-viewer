(Facility ID: 100000195362)\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n\n\nThe Mid-Missouri Energy, Inc. (MME) Ethanol Plant is located near Malta Bend, Saline County, Missouri.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel-grade ethanol from grain. Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquefaction of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture. Denaturant is added to the ethanol at the end of the process so the ethanol cannot be consumed.\n\n\n\nMME has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 0.5 miles.\n\n\n\nPrior to 2020, MME had a large 18,000-gallon ammonia tank on-site, which would have also been regulated by RMP.  However, this system has been decommissioned and MME has transitioned to a smaller 1,000-gallon tank.  This tank has less than 10,000 pounds of regulated substance and is therefore not required to be reported under the RMP regulations.  In the event the larger system is reinstalled, the RMP will be updated accordingly. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nMME is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nMME's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and den"

A release from one of these tanks would not be able to migrate off-site, and a fire resulting from a release could be quickly extinguished.  \n\n\n\nAdministrative controls for the denaturant includes following good engineering practices for maintenance of the systems as designed and installed. Also, administrative controls include following written operating procedures and to utilize specified personal protective equipment (PPE) for tasks when the potential for exposure exists. MME conducts employee training as part of facility activities. Lastly, operations at the tank farm can be overseen from the Control Room. \n\n\n\nFacility personnel at MME are not trained to be first responders to large incidents on-site. MME has coordinated with the Malta Bend Fire Department as well as the Marshall Fire Department for emergency response procedures.  MME has also contracted with a private hazmat company (Hazmat Response) based in Kansas City, Missouri. If a release were to occur the following response practices are to be implemented: \n\n\n\nIncidental Releases (Small Discharge Scenario)\n\n\n\nA release is an incidental release and does not require immediately notifying the Plant Manager or the EH&S Manager if the following is true:\n\n\n\n* The released hazardous substance can be absorbed or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees or other trained persons present.\n\n* The release is either inside or outside facility buildings, within secondary containment, on an impervious surface and does not reach pervious surfaces (i.e., soil) or stormwater drainage.\n\n* The released hazardous material is less than 25 gallons.\n\n* The release would not have posed a threat to human health and the environment if the release had not been immediately controlled.\n\n        \n\nIn response to an incidental release, the following steps will be taken:\n\n\n\n1.

The supervisor or assigned trained personnel will clean-up the spill.  Employees or trained personnel cleaning up the spill will be attired in the necessary protective equipment (i.e., goggles, rubber gloves, boots, etc.).

The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the radius.\n\n  \n\nAlthough MME has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\n\n\n\nSince MME qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\n\n\n\nSince the facility also qualifies as a Program 3, Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) were required.  The ARS is the release of 1000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.06 miles from the center of the facility.  There are no public receptors within these radiuses that would be affected by the alternative releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant in the past five years that: Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the continuation of safe conditions. Updates to "

      "SummaryText": "OSHA regulations, as well as other regulatory updates, are received by email and postal mail to be evaluated by staff regularly. MME conducts monthly safety meetings where recommendations for improvements are discussed and implemented. Additionally, the facility was recently inspected by the EPA in March 2016.  MME has completed all of the recommended improvements to the safety program based on this inspection.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\n\n\n\nMME is registered with the Saline County, MO LEPC and does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high-level emergency response, MME would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \n\n\n\nAs explained above, MME is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel would respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility. \n\n\n\nMME has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. An FRP & SPCC Plan was also prepared and implemented for the denaturant and final product storage in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes. The following list provides a facility organizational chart with respect to RMP responsibilities. \n\n \n\nNAME            \n\n1) Shawn Davis\n\n2) Tyler Edmundson\n\n3) Area Supervisors\n\n4) Onsite Personnel & Contractors    \n\n\n\nTITL"
