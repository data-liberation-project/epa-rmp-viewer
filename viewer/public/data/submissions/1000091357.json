The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank.  The worst-case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.

(Facility ID: 100000195362)\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\r\n\r\nThe Mid-Missouri Energy, Inc. (MME) Ethanol Plant is located near Malta Bend, Saline County, Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel-grade ethanol from grain. Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquefaction of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance under the RMP program is Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considered a flammable mixture. Denaturant is added to the ethanol at the end of the process so the ethanol cannot be consumed.\r\n\r\nMME has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 0.5 miles.\r\n\r\nPrior to 2020, MME had a large 18,000-gallon ammonia tank on-site, which would have also been regulated by RMP.  However, this system has been decommissioned and MME has transitioned to a smaller 1,000-gallon tank.  This tank has less than 10,000 pounds of regulated substance and is therefore not required to be reported under the RMP regulations.  In the event the larger system is reinstalled, the RMP will be updated accordingly. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\n\r\nMME is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nMME's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. The two ethanol tanks, two final product tanks, and den"

MME conducts monthly safety meetings where recommendations for improvements are discussed and implemented. Additionally, the facility was recently inspected by the EPA in March 2016.  MME has completed all of the recommended improvements to the safety program based on this inspection.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nMME is registered with the Saline County, MO LEPC and does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high-level emergency response, MME would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \r\n\r\nAs explained above, MME is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel would respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility. \r\n\r\nMME has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38. An FRP & SPCC Plan was also prepared and implemented for the denaturant and final product storage in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.

If the supervisor decides the release does not constitute a threat to human health or the environment and does not require assistance by personnel outside the immediate area of the spill, then clean-up will begin.\r\n2.\tThe supervisor or assigned trained personnel will clean-up the spill.  Employees or trained personnel cleaning up the spill will be attired in the necessary protective equipment (i.e., goggles, rubber gloves, boots, etc.).  If necessary, clean-up will be preceded by an attempt to stop the discharge, restricting traffic through the spill area, and limiting migration of the release by laying berms of absorbent materials.\r\n3.\tThe supervisor or trained personnel will absorb the released material with appropriate disposable materials.  The plant has speedi-dry, sand, and spill kits readily available. \r\n4.\tThe contaminated absorbent will be containerized, labeled, and disposed of properly.\r\n5.\tMaterials such as gloves that were contaminated as a result of the release will also be containerized, labeled, and disposed of.  These materials are typically considered regulated waste and cannot be disposed of with the facility's other waste.  Also, liquid waste can never be poured down a drain.  \r\n6.\tThe EH&S Manager or the Plant Manager will ensure no waste incompatible with released materials is treated, stored, or disposed of at the facility until the clean-up is complete.\r\n7.\tThe EH&S Manager or the Plant Manager will ensure emergency equipment listed in this Plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations at the facility resume.\r\n8.\tThe EH&S Manager or the Plant Manager will check for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment before operations resume.\r\n\r\nMedium Discharge and Worst-Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nA release is co"

      "SummaryText": "nsidered non-incidental if it has one or more of the following criteria: \r\n\r\n* The released substance cannot be absorbed or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees or other trained persons present.\r\n* The release is either outside facility buildings on a pervious surface or inside and may reach pervious surfaces (i.e., soil), or stormwater drainage.\r\n* The released material is more than 25 gallons.\r\n* The release may pose a threat to human health and the environment if the release is not immediately controlled.\r\n\r\nThe following describes procedures for non-incidental hazardous releases:\r\n\r\nUpon detection of the release, the discovering employee will immediately notify a supervisor.  If the supervisor assesses that clean-up efforts would require the assistance of personnel from beyond the immediate area of the spill, then the supervisor will notify the EH&S Manager or the Plant Manager and the Control Room that there has been a large release.  The supervisor will also relate the extent of or potential for migration of the spill to the environment.  The supervisor may attempt to stop the flow of the product if doing so poses no personal threat or harm.  Once notified, the EH&S Manager or the Plant Manager will act as the Coordinator for managing the release and will then take the following steps:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe Coordinator may decide to evacuate the building or facility, in which case an announcement will be made over the radios.\r\n2.\tThe Coordinator will assess the secondary containment, decide whether the product can be reclaimed, and decide whether the emergency response contractor and MoDNR 24-hr spill response hotline (573-634-2436) need to be notified.  If deemed necessary, the Fire Department (911), Police Department (911), and/or the local hospital will also be notified.\r\n3.\tThe Coordinator may direct the use of the onsite heavy equipment to create soil berms/swales halting the movement of the spill and the placement of available spill response mate"
