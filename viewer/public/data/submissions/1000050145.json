      "SummaryText": "Since Hawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938, the company has become a critical source of chemical products for communities and businesses across the upper midwest.  For example, nearly all municipal and industrial water treatment facilities in the region rely on Hawkins for disinfectants and other treatment products, equipment and expertise.\n\n\n\nHawkins, Inc. is based in Roseville, Minnesota with branches that meet local needs in seven neighboring states.   The company's primary business is to repackage, custom-blend and distributed products for the water disinfection, pharmaceutical, food, computer and other industries.  The Risk Management Plan that Hawkins staff has filed for this facility is a planning and prevention tool; it helps us to better identify hazards and communicate with others.\n\n\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response policies: Hawkins' management has set a goal that \"Zero Can Be Done\"regarding accidents and injuries. Support for this goal is manifested in a number of ways such as:  \n\n- A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental department staffed with trained professionals.\n\n- Training programs in chemical safety, accident prevention and emergency response.  \n\n- Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences. \n\n- Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations. \n\n- Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping of materials.\n\n- Audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The Hawkins Water Treatment Group - Columbia Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes a number of materials used to protect\n\npublic health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses. The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n\n\nPrevention Program: Accident prevention is achieved through han"

      "SummaryText": "dling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage. This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to\n\ncontain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport. It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and equipping them with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation. Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program. We also\n\nfollow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding\n\ncommunity..\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History: As a result of our diligence, there has not been an accident involving chlorinein the past 5 years.  The facility did have a sulfur dioxide leakin in 2013 as result of a fuse plug failure on a 150 pound cyclinder.  The cyclinder placed into a recovery vessel for return to the packager/manufacture.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response: In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release, Hawkins Water Treatment Group\n\nemployees are trained to investigate the situation and if needed:\n\n1.    Call the local fire department for hazmat assistance.\n\n2.    Evacuate to a safe distance.\n\n\n\nRepresentative of the Boone County Fire Protection District has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site. In order to help assist the local fire department, Hawkins has a special recovery vessel on site in which a leaking 150 pound or smaller cylinder can be inserted to contain any further release. Planned Changes: While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than continued compliance to industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Zero Can Be Done\".
