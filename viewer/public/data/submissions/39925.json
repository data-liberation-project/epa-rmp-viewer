This commitment extends to the processes covered by the requirements of EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Florence, Alabama facility of Sara Lee Foods (Sara Lee Florence) has developed management systems to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. These management systems comply with the various applicable governmental regulations. The systems were developed through systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nSara Lee Florence has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nSara Lee Florence plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, management systems at the Florence facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  \n\n2   Background Data\n\nSara Lee Florence manufactures pork sausage and a variety of other meat products marketed under familiar brand names such as Jimmy Dean, Bryan and State Fair.

This process is a Program 3 process as defined by the risk management program rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n5   Release Scenarios\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, SLF evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate-case scenario were developed.\n\n6   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, SLF has implemented precautionary measures. These precautionary measures comply with OSHA\u00bfs PSM regulations and were evaluated and engineered for potential anhydrous ammonia releases.   Examples of some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, manual and automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, SLF has trained approximately 35 employees to respond to potential ammonia releases.  These trained employees comprise the facility\u00bfs Process Safety Team.\n\nSLF has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures incorporate safety measures.  Safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed annually by a highly qualified SOP review team. \n\nSLF encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of monthly Process Safety Team meetings.  Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees following written management of change procedures established by SLF.\n\nSLF understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases. Therefore, SLF has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is managed and documented to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.

Low temperatures are required in the food processing areas of the plant within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  These low temperatures ensure quality in the final products.
