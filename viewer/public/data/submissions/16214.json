Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.FACILITY INFORMATION:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of dry fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 250,000 pounds in 2 tanks.  The capacity of these tanks is 30,000 gallons.\n\n3.THE WORST-CASE release scenario would be the release of the contents of the storage  tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model is 1.16 miles.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 3 inch transfer hose, with 13319 pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is .28 miles.\n\n4.THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past"
