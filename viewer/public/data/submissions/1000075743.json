Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent \r\npotential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Canadian Valley Complex has safety features on many units to help:\r\n(1) contain/control a release\r\n(2) quickly detect a release, and\r\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\r\n\r\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: Release Detection\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n4.

This \r\ncommitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and \r\nconsidering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Company \r\npolicy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\nHowever, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take \r\nactions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Canadian Valley Gas Plant, located in Calumet, Oklahoma, U.S.A., operates a variety of \r\nprocesses to produce Methane, Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) and Condensate petroleum products from \r\nnatural gas.  The Canadian Valley Complex has regulated flammables, including, but not limited to:\r\n- Methane\r\n- Ethane\r\n- Propane\r\n- Isobutane\r\n- Normal Butane\r\n- IsoPentane\r\n- Pentane\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nFollowing is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Canadian Valley Gas \r\nPlant.  Processes at the Canadian Valley Complex which are regulated by the Environmental \r\nProtection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the \r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. \r\nThis summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place \r\nto implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Canadian Valley Complex encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety \r\nmanagement and accident prevention.
