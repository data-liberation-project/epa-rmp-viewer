      "SummaryText": "This terminal handles propane, which is considered by EPA to be a hazardous substance. The same properties that make propane valuable as fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to reduce the threat to the health of employees and nearby members of the community as well as the nearby environment. It is the terminal?s policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner in propane is handled: on the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, on the safe handling procedures used at this terminal, and on the training of the terminal?s personnel.\n\nThis terminal has implemented all 14 elements of OSHA?s 29CFR1910.119 Process Safety Management. The emergency response program is based on NPGA?s LP-Gas Safety Handbook, NFPA-58, and on pre-planning with local emergency responders. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of local fire authorities and notification of potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThis terminal?s primary purpose is to distribute propane to retail and wholesale customers, who use the propane as fuel. Propane is received by rail car and by truck transport and stored in pressurized storage vessels. It is distributed by truck to the customers. The terminal has equipment for unloading rail cars and trucks and it has equipment for loading trucks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, authorized management, and authorized contractors.\n\nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest allowable amount would release propane. NFPA-58 and company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the terminal?s vessels to 85% at 60 F. For worst case modeling purposes, it is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor which finds an ignition source and, per EPA guidelines, 10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. The distance to the endpoint of 1-psi overpressure is 0"

      "SummaryText": ".48 miles.\n\nAn alternate release scenario is that of a hose failure in the terminal?s loading or unloading areas. In this case, the tank?s excess flow valve would stop the flow into the hose, so that only the contents of the hose would be released. The calculated distance to the resulting endpoint is 0.21 miles, which has the possibility of extending beyond the terminal?s boundary.\n\nThe terminal complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulation. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFP-58. All terminal operators and drivers have been thoroughly trained using NPGA?s guidelines and company policy.\n\nThis terminal has no history of accidents or releases.\n\nThis facility was constructed in 2002."
