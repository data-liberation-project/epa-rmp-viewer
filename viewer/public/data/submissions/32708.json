The seals and all controls associated with this pump are checked to make sure they are operable.  Upon verification of the three units, ventilation, leak detectors, and scrubber, the system is then activated to verify operation.\r\n\r\nAlternative systems are in tact if failure of engineering or administrative controls were to occur.  In the event of a failure of the ventilation system, should there be a leak in the feed room or tank room, the caustic scrubber would still be activated automatically.  Upon investigation of these units, if it is found that the ventilators failed to shut down, the ability to manually override them and to manually shut them down by turning off the power in the motor control center room is available.\r\n\r\nIn the event that there is a malfunctioning leak detector, a number of things could occur.  If a leak detector has a weak cell or a bad battery, these two scenarios will activate the alarm system.  Upon investigating the alarm, the operator can determine whether it is a true leak or a malfunction of the system using a portable gas monitor.  If it is determined that the leak detector has malfunctioned, the system does have the ability to lock that particular unit out of the sequence.  This does not disarm the other five units that are in place.  The likelihood of having all six malfunction is remote.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason, the caustic scrubber pump would not run automatically, there is a manual override available to kick the pump on.  If the caustic pump will not run automatically or manually and it has been verified by using portable leak detectors that there is a leak of such magnitude that plant personnel cannot handle it, an emergency call will be initiated to the Division of Fire and to DEEM to request assistance with the leak.\r\n\r\nOperations and procedures are very similar for sulfur dioxide"

Sulfur dioxide leak detection is utilized, and there are two leak detector systems located in the sulfur dioxide storage room and one in the feed room.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a sulfur dioxide leak in the feed or tank room, the following systems will be activated.  If a leak detector detects sulfur dioxide gas, the ventilation systems and the alarm systems will be activated.  The alarm system consists of both an audible and visual alarm inside and outside the building, and on the main computer.  The ventilation systems will shut down when the leak detectors are activated.  Following the ventilation shutdown, the scrubber system will immediately be activated, thus removing the contaminated air from the feed or storage room via intake piping.  Sulfur dioxide gas will settle to the lower portions of the room, where the air intake piping is located, allowing it to be picked up and pulled into the caustic tank room where it is passed through the caustic solution.  This caustic solution neutralizes the sulfur dioxide gas that is in the air and returns the scrubbed air back into the sulfur dioxide room.\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Summary\tcont:\r\n\r\n\r\nTown Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant has a comprehensive and thorough emergency response plan.

Notify Plant Operations Supervisor Senior and then the Solids Process Supervisor.\r\n\r\n2. Plant Operations, Solids Process Supervisor, or their designee along Plant Operator on duty will investigate the leak.  A minor leak is a release of less than 10 lbs while a major leak is a release of more than 10 lbs.\r\n\r\n3. Minor leak - Plant Operator on duty and Supervisor or designee to repair.\r\n\r\n4.

The EPA defines a worst-case release as the following:\r\n\r\n* The release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure, and\r\n\r\n* The release that results in the greatest distance to the endpoint for the regulated toxic substance.\r\n\r\nOnly passive mitigation measures were considered for the off-site consequence analysis for both scenarios (No active mitigation measures were considered).  The only passive mitigation at Town Branch applicable for these scenarios was enclosure of the toxic gases in the building.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine at any given time is no more then 20 tons and no more then 8 tons for sulfur dioxide. The largest quantity of both chemicals were determined by taking into account administrative controls rather than absolute capacity of the pipes.  Town Branch uses administrative controls that limit the quantity of chlorine and sulfur dioxide that can be stored in a pipe at any one time.\r\n\r\nThe toxic worst-case release for chlorine via a pipe leak at Town Branch, using only passive mitigation measures is 8,000 lbs with a release rate of 440 lbs/min.  The duration of the release is 10 minutes with wind speed calculated at 1.5 m/sec.  Considering these factors, the maximum effected radius or distance to the endpoint is calculated at 2 miles (based on EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables for Chlorine Gas).

Town Branch Waste Water Treatment Plant is located in Lexington, Kentucky, 301 Lisle Industrial Avenue and is operated by the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government - Division of Sanitary Sewers. The primary function of this facility is the treatment of wastewater, in doing so chlorine is used for disinfection purposes and sulfur dioxide is for the neutralization of chlorine in plant effluent.  The probability of a release at this facility is classified as low to medium.  The chlorine storage building with a full scrubbing facility should prevent any major release from leaving the area.  Should a leak of a chlorine cylinder or sulfur dioxide cylinder occur, the onsite personnel (LFUCG employees) and surrounding population would be immediately vulnerable to exposure.  In the event of a release, there may be possible human health impacts to on-site employees.  A residential area to the North as well as property and the environment would be affected.  Contamination near the facility is possible.  A worse case release could affect an area over 2.0 mile radius and impact a sizeable residential and institutional population.  The Lexington Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) Division of Sanitary Sewers has invested ample and considerable time in devising and implementing accidental release prevention programs and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nTown Branch Wastewater Treatment Plant applies a holistic and proactive approach towards risk management.  The LFUCG has devised a reliable maintenance program, identifying management policies, preventive maintenance practices, plans, and procedures to identify and minimize risk at the plant.
