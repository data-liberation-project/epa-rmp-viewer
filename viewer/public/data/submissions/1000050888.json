The previous submittal was completed using the 2004 RMP*Submit and a diskette, which allowed the submitter to document one Program under section 7 for similar processes. For that submittal, one Program was completed for the Chiller Group A, B, anc C ammonia processes. For the 2010 correction, the software does not appear to allow for one Program when there are multiple processes; therefore, the answers provided for process #78244 were repeated for processes 78242 and 78243. There is no new equipment or processes associated with this submittal.\r\n\r\nA correction was made to the RMP in December 2011 to address the sulfur dioxide incident that occurred on February 2011 and to reflect the change in the emergency contact.\r\n\r\nThe RMP was updated in September 2012 to address the installation of a fourth ammonia refrigeration system (Chiller Group D), which has a maximum intended inventory in excess of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nA correction was made to the RMP in February 2013 to reflect the change in the RMP Responsible Person and to correct the ammonia inventory for Chiller Group A.  This revision also addresses minor changes to this document based on The Wine Group's review.\r\n\r\nThe RMP was updated in November 2013 to meet the five year revalidation requirement.\r\n\r\nThe RMP was updated in July 2015 to address the changes to Chiller Group A.\r\n\r\nThe RMP was updated in February 2016 to address the changes to the sulfur dioxide process.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.

In the case of an ammonia related or sulfur dioxide-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated. If an ammonia or sulfur dioxide release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system. In the event that an ammonia or sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and The Wine Group, Inc. Maintenance Manager and Safety Representative (Supervisor). The Supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility is located at 17000 E. Highway 120 in Ripon, California, which is on the 120 Highway and approximately 5 miles east of Highway 99. The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with farmland and residential areas.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems:\r\nThe primary business of The Wine Group, Inc. is the production and processing of grape juice, wine, and distilled spirits.  In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 140,356 pounds of ammonia in its four independent ammonia refrigeration systems."

The refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment (compressors, evaporative condensers, pressure receiver, chillers, and suction accumulator, and Glycol Circulation System and Tank Jacket Heat Exchangers/Coolers), cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to wine product and/or glycol.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems:\r\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) is used to preserve wine and is injected directly into the wine and into the wine storage tank headspace. The sulfur dioxide is located at a single filling station with a maximum of one (1) active one-ton cylinder at the filling station and five (5) one-ton cylinders in storage adjacent to the filling station. The one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinder at the filling station is connected to a fixed-piping system by flexible hoses. The piping system provides a way to transfer the sulfur dioxide to smaller dispensing cylinders (6 pound, 25 pound, and 100 pound capacities). Operators fill the dispensing cylinders at the filling station and then inject SO2 from these smaller cylinders into the wine or into the tank headspace as needed. The facility uses a 100 pound cylinder fixed to a portable dispensing cart to add SO2 to the headspace of wine tanks.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and th"

Such RMP accidents would involve serious accidents with either onsite deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. The Wine Group, Inc. (Franzia Ripon) realizes that the community may also be interested in smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet such criteria. We have been diligent in reporting releases of hazardous materials and internally investigate and correct the causes of such releases.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Systems:\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history showed that there have been no RMP reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia that over the past five years (February 2011 - February 2016) that meet specific EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History (see above definition).\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide Systems:\r\nBetween February 2011 and February 2016, the facility had one RMP reportable incident that meets the above definition. On February 23, 2011, approximately 5 pounds of gaseous sulfur dioxide was released through a transfer hose failure, resulting in the injury of one employee. No other onsite impacts occurred, no off site impacts and no environmental or property damage occurred. Off-site responders were notified but did not respond. The results of the internal incident investigation showed that improved/upgraded equipment and revisions to maintenance, training and operating procedures were needed.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn case of an ammonia or sulfur dioxide emergency, the facility plans to evacuate all employees and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).

The Health and Safety committee as well as regulatory requirements have minimized chemical exposure risks to employees and the public through ongoing internal risk reduction efforts.  For example, as a result of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), vehicle barriers were recommended to be installed around the ammonia processes and detailed procedures were documented.  \r\n\r\nOther improvements will be made when identified and approved by Management."
