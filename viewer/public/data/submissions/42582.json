The facility is operated to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and is designed and operated in accordance with NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code requirements.  In addition, FNA operates the facility in accordance with our internal standards that employ good engineering practice and industry accepted principles and codes.  FNA has instituted operating and training procedures that are designed to provide a safe work environment and protect our neighbors.\n\nFNA operates a propane storage facility located at Highway 71 South in Jackson Minnesota.  The facility has one Risk Management Plan (RMP) covered process, involving propane.  The primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute propane to wholesale customers.  All propane is delivered to the facility by truck or pipeline and offloaded into storage tanks.  Propane is distributed from the storage vessels via transports to wholesale customers.  No other RMP regulated substances are maintained at the facility.  \n\nFor evaluation of the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp \u00bf software was used to calculate the radial distance to the overpressure endpoint.  The following prargraphs provide details of the worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n\nIn accordance with RMP guidelines, the worst case scenario for the facility is a vapor cloud explosion of the largest propane storage tank.  In this scenario, 108,120 pounds of propane is released.  The release quantity is limited to 85 percent of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  The release and resulting explosion is estimated to reach 1 psi overpressure approximately 0.40 miles from the center of the facility.  No mitigation systems were considered in the analysis.  The system is equipped with safety devices to prevent accidental releases, i"

      "SummaryText": "ncluding automatic shutoff valves, that respond to excess flow and fire exposure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on a pull-away incident caused by a propane transport truck driving away while still connected to the loading or unloading system by a 2-inch hose.  This system is equipped with manual and automatic shutoff systems to allow safe remote shutoff.  The quantity of propane released in the incident was estimated assuming a liquid full hose and assuming that shutoff was not immediate.  This incident was used in an attempt ot obtain a release quantity sufficient to predict an off site impact in a vapor cloud explosion.  No mitigation systems were considered in the analysis.  The predicted release quantity is 244 pounds of propane, and the distance to reach 1 psi overpressure is 0.03 mile from the center of the facility.  \n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out in 40 CFR Part 68. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, 1998 Edition. The elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility include process safety information , process hazard analyses, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation and contractor safety.\n\nFNA, Jackson, Minnesota has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the previous 5 years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during the period.\n\nFNA maintains a written emergency response plan based on OSHA's Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of propane.  The plan includes evacuating the area, notification of local emergency response agencies, and providing technical assistance when needed.  The facility's plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the process that would require modification"

Our employees perform incidental response, which is limited to actions that can be safely taken to stop or prevent a minor release of propane.  In the event of a major release or incident such as a fire, FNA's policy is to depend on the Fire Department to respond with the appropriately trained personnel.  The facility has coordinated emergency response with the Jackson Fire Department and has written procedures in place in the event of an emergency.  FNA constantly reviews propane operations and procedures to improve safety."
