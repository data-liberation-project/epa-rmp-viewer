The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the local emergency planning committee improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) although unlikely, is more probable than a worst-case release scenario and (2) could result in a potential off-site consequence.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule requires specific requirements for the worst case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Mead-Escanaba.  These requirements are:\n\n One worst case scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 2 or Program 3 processes  (i.e., one scenario representing both chlorine and chlorine dioxide)\nOne alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substance in a Program 2 or Program 3 process (i.e., chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ammonia)\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analyses performed by Mead-Escanaba.\n\n1.3.1  Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic substances is rupture of an 10,0"

Some environmental receptors are located within this distance (e.g., national forest and state park).\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine (1-ton cylinder) is a failure of a \u00bc\u00bf tube on a vacuum regulator valve.

This scenario assumes that the solution is released through the hole for 30 minutes before the workers detect the release and isolate the line.  The released chlorine dioxide solution forms a pool and the chlorine dioxide evaporates from the pool, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.1 miles.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Mead Paper Division-Escanaba Mill (Mead-Escanaba) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Mead-Escanaba has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Two components of this system are a Process Safety Management (PSM) program that helps manage the risk and that complies with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals; and a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Mead-Escanaba.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.    \n\nThe process safety and risk management program at Mead-Escanaba consists of three elements:\n\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5\n\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3.

In fact, Mead-Escanaba has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguard against release of a hazardous substance and resultant injuries or damage from such a release.\n\nMead-Escanaba limits the use of hazardous substances.  Prior to using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead-Escanaba, consideration is given to the potential for this substance to adversely affect employees, the public, as well as the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\n\nMead-Escanaba prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at Mead-Escanaba, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nMead-Escanaba limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Mead-Escanaba trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release should one occur.  In addition, Mead-Escanaba works with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur. \n\nThe safety program at Mead-Escanaba consists of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP rule.

Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n4. Operating Procedures.  Mead-Escanaba process engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:  \n\nsteps for safely conducting activities\napplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\nsafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\n\nMead-Escanaba personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the Mead-Escanaba processes and as a training guide.\n\n5. Training.  Mead-Escanaba trains employees to perform their assigned tasks in a safe and effective manner.  The Mead-Escanaba training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material.\n\nThe operators are consulted after training sessions to evaluate the e"

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Industry standards are followed at Mead-Escanaba to help ensure safe handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia via Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank design and construction are consistent with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by Mead-Escanaba.\n\nChlorine.  Chlorine is supplied in DOT-approved 1-ton cylinders.  Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is absorbed into process water for use in the water treatment unit.  The length of piping containing chlorine is kept to a minimum to reduce the likelihood of a release.  If release occurs downstream of the regulator at the cylinder, the regulator will close and only the quantity in the piping will be released.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in most areas containing chlorine.  Employees who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for chlorine developed by Mead-Escanaba.       \n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Mead-Escanaba facility and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a chlorine dioxide solution (1.2 wt%) is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequenc"
