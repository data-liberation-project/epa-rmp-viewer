      "SummaryText": "The Rochester Meat Company, located at 1825 7th Street NW, is a production facility offering a wide range of meat products. Rochester Meat uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Ammonia System falls under the EPA Rick Management Program due to the system quantity in excess of 10,000 lbs. The Rochester Meat refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 0 psi to a high side of 185 psi. Due to the ammonia system expansion done in 2003 the systems maximum intended inventory is 17,400 pounds.\n\nProcess:\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Rochester Meat facility is a two stage system. Consisting of a high side and a low pressure side. The low side is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side is intended to refrigerate the product. The Ammonia Refrigeration system is protected by built in safeties to prevent a run away system.The built in safeties include Safety Relief Valves, Engine Room Ventilation, and system interlocks for pressure, temperature and liquid levels.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nAlthough the worst case scenario is required by EPA it is an unlikely event. Design, construction, operation and government regulations are such that a catastrophic failure is extremely remote. Rochester Meat follows all codes in accordance with ASME, and Pressure and Vessel Codes.\nThe worst-case scenario release to toxic endpoint was determined using the RMP Comp guidelines for anhydrous ammonia. The scenario was based on the following criteria:\nVessel: Control Pressure Receiver\nAmount Released 4,250 Lbs.\nDuration of release 10 minutes\nRelease Rate 425 lbs/min\nAtmospheric Stability F\nTopography Urban\nBased on RMP Comp the toxic endpoint for this worst case scenario is 0.30 miles down wind.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe alternative worst case scenario release to toxic endpoint was"

In implementing their PSM program, Rochester Meat Co. has established written Standard Operating Procedures and Safe Maintenance Procedures to operate and maintain the ammonia refrigeration system.  Rochester Meat Co. has also outlined and implemented a training program to assure that well trained refrigeration operators and trained HAZMAT responders can safely and properly operate the ammonia system. Also Rochester Meat Co. has held tabletop and scenario drills with the Rochester Fire Dept. to coordinate efforts to minimize an offsite consequence that should occur.\n\nRochester Meat Co. is very dedicated to aligning their of the ammonia system to meet all of the regulations under the OSHA and EPA rulings regarding Anhydrous Ammonia. Rochester Meat Co.  has had their PSM program audited by the state OSHA and has received and Award Merit for their outstanding efforts in implementing their PSM program.  Rochester Meat Co.  is the only meat manufacture in the state on Minnesota to have received this award."
