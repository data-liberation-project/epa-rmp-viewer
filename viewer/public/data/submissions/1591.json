Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company in Goodridge are strongly committed to employee, public and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably,\nif such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and\nmitigate the effects of the release.    We are also coordinated with Goodridge Fire Department which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities includes support services  for crop production.  We have Anhydrous\nAmmonia  stored in one 30,000 gallon tank at our facility located along Highway 219 in Goodridge\n(Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 27,000 gallons (138,942 lbs.) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 90%.\n\n  3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we utilized RMP Comp \nprovided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The following paragraphs provide details\nof the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (120416 lbs.) in gaseous form over 10 minutes.   At Class F\natmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s windspeed  and an rural topography, the maximum distance of 12.0\nmiles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Figure 2).\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves"
