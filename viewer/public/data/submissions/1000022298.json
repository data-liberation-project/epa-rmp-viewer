These chemicals and their maximum intended inventory levels are: anhydrous ammonia, 20,000 pounds; 37% formaldehyde  60,000 pounds,  12% oleum, 12,000 pounds and hydrochloric acid (37% solution), 66,800 pounds hydrogen, 17860 lbs, 23% ammonia (ammoniate) and dimethyl amine  12,000 lbs.  \nAnyhdrous ammonia and hydrogen are gases delivered by truck and  maintained in  pressurized  tanks, 12% oleum is a solution stored in a 2000 gallon vessel while hydrochloric acid solution, aqueous ammonia , and 37% formaldehyde are  liquids that are stored in an atmospheric  tanks 60 % dimethyl amine is stored in drums and processing vessels   In addition to minimizing the inventory of these and other chemicals that are needed for our production operations, we also try to remove the chemicals from our site when they are no longer needed for a production campaign.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-case release scenarios have been modeled for, 37% hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, 12% oleum, aqueous ammonia, hydrogen and dimethyl amine.  An alternative release scenario has also been modeled for each substance as well. Some  of the releases have off-site impact. \n\n Anhydrous ammonia  For the worst-case scenario the pressurized tanks  leaks and releases 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia id  (the entire contents of the pressurized tank) in 10 minutes.

Employee input during all stages and phases is critical.\n\nProcess Safety Information:  MSDSs are furnished by our customers, and they usually contain toxicity, PEL, physical, reactivity, and corrosivity data.  The R&D Department reviews this and other (i.e., thermal and chemical stability) information obtained from customers, and if the information is inadequate, testing of the reaction mixtures or compounds is performed.  The Engineering Department generates a P&ID for each project so that the R&M Department can install the equipment as designed.  The Engineering Department has determined the electrical classification for the various buildings and purchases equipment which meets these requirements.  The Engineering Department designs the general ventilation systems for the production buildings and designs the local ventilation systems throughout the plant.  Design Codes and standards that are used are a combination of Albemarle, Tyrone Plant requirements,  ASME Boiler Codes, NFPA Codes, and other applicable codes and standards.  The Engineering Department reviews the process and generates a short process description and block flow diagram.  It also reviews proposed chemical usage and determines the maximum inventory levels.  The Engineering Department reviews process chemistry and determines the corrosivity of raw materials and reaction mixtures.  They then select the proper equipment which will withstand the corrosive effect of the various chemicals or mixtures.  The Engineering Department develops relief system design using a computer program and often customer recommendations.  The R&D Department develops material balances for the reactions.  The Engineering Department generates a list of safety systems and engineering controls (i.e., interlocks, pressure relief devices, computer alarms and controls) which are used during a project.\n\nProcess Hazard An"

Administrative control of the projects is maintained by the use of a Production Batch Record for each batch that is produced, Production Shift Supervisor Checklists for each shift, and Production Coordinator weekly production reports.  Facility siting concerns are reviewed using a checklist developed by the Engineering Department.  Human factors are covered during the PHA.  The Production Department has established Standard Operating Procedures for corrective action systems for both ISO 9002 and 14001.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Production Coordinators write Batch Records for each project.  The batch records are used as operating instructions for production operators.  The Production Department  develops procedures for emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup after an emergency; these are included in the batch records.  The R&D Department also generates limits for temperature and pressure that are incorporated into the batch records.  The Safety Department reviews the MSDS for each raw material and product, and the information is put into a batch record safety sheet which uses a standard format to make it easier for operators to locate needed information.  Raw material and product specifications are developed to maintain materials quality control.\n\nTraining:  The Production Project Coordinator conducts initial training for Production and R&M employees before each project starts.  Refresher training is conducted prior to successive production campaigns.\n\nContractors:  Contractors use Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency evacuation procedures and safety permits, and Albemarle, Tyrone Plant informs contractors of work and unique process hazards.  Contractors attend Albemarle, Tyrone Plant safety training programs and also ha"

The Engineering and Safety Departments conduct periodic evaluations of the safety programs and performance for each contractor company.\n\nPreStartup Safety Review:  A series of checklists are developed and implemented to ensure that all appropriate items are reviewed before projects are started.  The Production Project Coordinator develops a list of recommendations from the PHA, and the recommendations are resolved before the project is started.\n\nMechanical Integrity:  The R&M Department has developed Standard Operating Procedures for Preventive Maintenance, and personnel are assigned to conduct the various PM items.  The PM system is also a part of the ISO 9002 and 14001 systems, and these systems are each audited two times a year by third party auditors.  The R&M Department conducts an annual shutdown each year in which additional equipment is inspected and/or tested.  Certain equipment may also be inspected and/or tested by contractors.  The R&M Department has developed and implemented a quality assurance program for various types of equipment to ensure that replacement parts meet initial design requirements (replacement in kind).\n\nHot Work Permit:  The Safety Department has developed and implemented a Hot Work Permit which is used by all Albemarle, Tyrone Plant and contractor employees.  Other permits (i.e., Line Breaking, Confined Space, Lockout/Tagout, Safe Work, Elevated Work) are also implemented.\n\n\nManagement of Change Procedure:  Standard Operating Procedures are developed and implemented to describe when this procedure applies.  If a change is needed for a project, the Project Coordinator initiates an MOC Procedure, and the MOC is reviewed by the appropriate personnel.  The hard copy of the MOC is maintained in Production, and the MOC is also tracked in our computer network.\n\nIncident Investigation Procedure:  The Production Shift Supervisor generates the initial incident report following any accident, incident, or clos"

These suggestions are added to a computer tracking system where the are monitored until they are resolved.  Information is shared with appropriate employees at the plant and at other company locations.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response:  The Safety and Environmental Departments have developed several emergency response plans for the site.  Training and drills are conducted to ensure the plans are understood and followed.\n\nAudits:  Process Hazard Analyses are conducted prior to each new campaign, and at least every five years for repetitive projects which last more than five years.  Batch records are continuously reviewed and updated to ensure they are accurate and the production employees are following them.  The Corporate Safety Department conducts a compliance audit at least every three years to certify compliance with the PSM standard.\n\nTrade Secrets:  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant does not claim any trade secrets.    \n\nEmergency response program\n\nSeveral plans and procedures address emergency planning and response for the entire plant as well as procedures for handling localized releases.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated to reflect any facility changes, and is coordinated with the Blair County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Annually, all employees receive training in their duties under the plan, and the evacuation plan is practiced at least once each year.  Each shift has a trained Emergency Response Team, that is equipped to respond to fires, spills and releases, and medical emergencies.  Each Team is comprised of employees and is led by its shift supervisor, who assumes the role of Incident Commander during any on-site emergency.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant emergency response personnel receive appropriate training (i.e., confined space rescue, SCBA, fire fighting, spill response); some members are also certified in CPR and first aid response.

After the drill is completed, it is critiqued; the findings and recommendations are used to help design future drills and training exercises.  Using this approach, each Team addresses specific response areas that need improvement.\n\nAll production and maintenance employees are also trained to respond to spills and releases, and all employees receive training in the use of hand held fire extinguishers to extinguish incipient stage fires.  In addition, the facility is protected with a foam sprinkler system, and is also equipped with several outdoor fire monitors and wheeled fire extinguishers that may be used in the event of a larger fire.  In addition to this emergency response training, all employees are instructed to activate the fire alarm and to evacuate the facility in the event of an emergency.    \n\nWe also utilize the emergency fire and medical response services provided by the City of Tyrone emergency response personnel; response time to our facility is about five (5) minutes.  We provide periodic orientation and informational tours for off-site response personnel.  These training sessions are often conducted in conjunction with the addition of new equipment and/or a new chemistry to the facility.  Albemarle, Tyrone Plant Emergency Response Teams also conduct training and emergency response drills in conjunction with the City of Tyrone and Blair County response organizations.  The 1993 Blair County mock drill was conducted at Albemarle, Tyrone Plant; it involved a spill from a bulk tank and a fire.  In 1996, Albemarle, Tyrone Plant participated in a chlorine release drill with Tyrone fire companies; this scenario is similar to the chlorine worst-case release scenario identified in this plan.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nSeveral changes are being planned to help improve safety.
