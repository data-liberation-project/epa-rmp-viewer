Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nThe Wacker Chemical Corporation, Polymers Division (Wacker) plant, which is located on Highway 95 in Calvert City is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Under RMP, the Calvert City plant is classified as two sources:  \n\n\n\n1.    The main plant stationary source on Highway 95 and\n\n2.    The storage, pipeline, and barge unloading source at the Tennessee River. \n\n\n\nThe largest quantity raw material feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of Wacker's VAE Emulsions and Sekisui Polyvinyl Alcohol.  Ethylene and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) are also used in the production of VAE and EVCL Emulsions.  VAM, VCM, and ethylene, in the quantities handled at this facility, are considered hazardous by EPA under the Risk Management Rule.  \n\n\n\nWacker is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky, and local rules and regulations.  The Wacker Site Manager at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.  \n\n\n\nAs a site that is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemical emergencies.  Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications.  Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation.  Trained and qualified employees work with sophisticated control systems that include instrumentation, alarms, and shutdowns to keep our processes operating in safe limits that minimize adverse impacts on the"

Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our Polymers Safety Process (PSP) contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures, and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard and operability (HAZOP) methodology.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that Wacker employees must follow under the contractor safety program.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees.  Wacker shares emergency response resources on the plant site with the Sekisui PVOH plant and Evonik.  Wacker, Evonik and Sekisui participate in a partnership among the Calvert City area industries named the Calvert City Industrial Mutual Aid Program or CIMAP.  This organization collaborates with community emergency responders and citizens to form a strong Local Emergency Planning Committee or LEPC.

The RMP covered processes are the Dispersions unit and the VAM storage and distribution unit.  \n\n\n\nIn the Disperions unit, VAM, ethylene, and/or VCM is batch polymerized in water to form a co-polymer emulsion product.  A number of other chemicals that are not covered by the RMP regulations, may be used to adjust emulsions product properties for specific end uses.  Emulsions products are used in many applications including adhesives, latex paints, and paper coatings.  \n\n\n\nThe VAM storage and distribution area at the main production facility receives VAM from tanks at the Tennessee River and stores it on site to continuously supply the dispersions production facility and the Sekisui PVOH production facility.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this stationary source are:\n\nA?Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 433,000 pounds.  \n\nA?Ethylene with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 237,000 pounds\n\nA?Vinyl Chloride with a maximum quantity in an individual process of 150,000 pounds\n\n\n\n3.

This protection starts with the facility design and construction.  Wacker meets or exceeds all design and construction codes when implementing new projects in the plant.   A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of process equipment, tanks, vessels, and piping.  These checks are done using non-destructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \n\n\n\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance.

Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \n\n\n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.  Process areas are covered by fire sensors and flammable vapor sensors, fire sprinkler systems, monitor nozzles, dry chemical extinguishers, etc.  Containment dikes around storage tanks and process areas are curbed to contain small spills and direct them to drains to the plant's chemical sewer and the wastewater treatment plant.  \n\n\n\nEach process design is subject to detailed process hazard reviews during design, construction, and start-up.  All process changes must be reviewed and approved under a detailed Management of Change procedure before any changes are made.  At periods not to exceed five years, Operational Plant Hazard Reviews (OPHR's) are conducted by multi-disciplinary teams.  \n\n\n\nThe elements of the prevention program are audited regularly at the plant and corporate levels.
