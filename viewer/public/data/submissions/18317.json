It is the intention of Davis Gas Processing management to provide safe and healthy working conditions and to establish and insist upon safe practices at all times by all employees. The prevention of accidents is an objective affecting all levels of our company and its operations. It is, therefore, a basic requirement that each supervisor make the safety of all employees an integral part of his or her regular management function. It is equally the duty of each employee to accept and follow established safety regulations and procedures. Every effort will be made to provide adequate training to employees. Employees are expected to assist management in accident prevention activities. Unsafe conditions must be reported immediately. Safety is everyone\u0012s business.\n\nSITE DESCRIPTION\nThe Irion County DGP Plant is located 10 miles North of Barnhart, Tx. On Hwy. 163.\nThere is a  Propane storage tank for refrigeration, which stores 142 barrels of product. The Tank is painted, welded steel, above ground, horizontal pressure vessel. The  tank operates up to 200 psig and is protected by a pressure relief valve. Liquid flow into this tank is determined by the process operations. Liquid flow out of this tank goes to tank truck loading and is manually controlled. Operating personnel on a daily basis visually inspect this tank.  If a spill occurred at this tank, the contents are so volatile that they would evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree. The ground would freeze and contain the propane as it evaporated.\nThere is also a Natural Gas Liquid Storage Tank which is mainly condensate from the plant, that stores 1,200 barrels. The other Natural Gas Liquid Storage Tank stores 240 barrels, both tanks are a  painted, welded steel, above ground, vertical vessels. The tanks  are protected"

If a spill occurred at these tanks, the highly volatile contents would extensively evaporate before penetrating the ground to any significant degree.\n\nPURPOSE AND GOALS FOR THE IRION COUNTY DGP PLANT\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ACTION PLAN\nEmergency Response And Action Plans (ERAP) were developed by Davis Gas Processing  for its Irion County DGP Plant located in Caldwell County, Texas.  The ERAP was developed to assist the Irion County DGP Plant Foreman in his responsibility to provide skilled and compliant emergency leadership in the event of emergency situations.\nThe ultimate goals of the Irion County DGP Plant ERAP are as follows:\n\t1.\tTo provide Irion County DGP Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to avoid process emergencies by predicting and recognizing potentially hazardous situations.\n\t2.\tTo provide Irion County DGP Plant employees with emergency prevention training that will allow them to recognize and assess the consequences of personal actions when working  with equipment containing pressurized,  very cold, highly volatile,  and flammable substances.\n\t3.\tTo assure that Irion County DGP Plant  employees will respond in a safe, prompt, and compliant fashion in the event of unintentional releases of hazardous chemicals in and from the Irion County DGP Plant.\n\t4.\tTo guarantee that all Irion County DGP Plant visitors  will be effectively warned to recognize, avoid, and to escape hazardous situations and guarantee that they will be accounted for and removed from the Irion County DGP Plant in the event of a site emergency.\n\t5.\tTo document that Irion County DGP Plant emergency response efforts were effective,  prompt,  and  professional.\n\t6.\tTo document that Irion County DGP Plant emergenc"

New and change in status employees have been trained when assigned to perform any duties that involve the handling of hazardous chemicals.  This facility has an Emergency Shut-Down Procedure that describes the steps to be taken in order for normal operations to be stopped and utility service to be cut off as personnel evacuate the premises during emergency situations.  The Foreman is responsible for accounting for all employees, personally or through a designee, by having all employees report to predetermined, designated rally point and conducting  a head count. Rescue and medical duties will be performed by EMS personnel from the Mertzon, Texas Fire Department. The employees of the facility will be notified by verbal notification if  an evacuation is necessary.  All personnel have been trained in the safe and orderly emergency evacuation of the premises. The training includes, but is not limited to, the Emergency Shut-Down Procedures, escape routes, exits, and rally points. Training was and/or will be provided for employees when:\n1.  The plan was initiated\n2.  Responsibilities change\n3.  Employees are hired or transferred.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \n The worst-case scenario would involve some sort of mechanical object (e.g. plane, vehicle) to hit or rupture the storage tank of  the  Propane or Natural Gas Liquids Tank.\nThe Propane Storage Tanks contains 25,200 lbs."

No public facilities or other housing is in the exposed radius.\n\nThis facility  has  had no accidents in the last 5 years involving a regulated chemical, that has involved death, injury, or emergency response. Our facility has procedures coordinated with the local response agencies encase of  an accidental release.\nThis facility follows the rules and regulations of  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency(EPA),  and the Texas Railroad Commission(TNRCC).This facility has labeled all their storage tanks with identifying signs and NFPA labels which enable the fire department easy identification of the products health, flammability, and reactivity.  By following these rules and regulation we are involved in an extensive training program for our employees. This facility  has an ongoing safety training program for their personnel. This program involves all the regulated training programs plus any on the job situations that our employees might encounter."
