In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with\nour Local Fire Company(s),  Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate\nauthorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any\nrelease and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422910, Farm Supplies Wholesalers, \nhowever we are also engaged  in providing agricultural inputs that include the receiving,\nstorage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The\nNAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and reloading is # 493130\nfarm product warehousing and storage.  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only\nproduct subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we\nalso handle Propane  for  both agricultural uses and home heating, which is under\nconsideration as a listed substance.  We include Propane (as well as all crop protectents and\npetroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only\nthe Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.    \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm\nfiel"

The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage\nvessels at the location described is  76,500 Lbs. The maximum on site vessel size is 18,000      \nGallons, storing   76,500  Lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be\nthe off-loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving\nand reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the\n2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a full time employee on site, therefore item number\n1.11 is Zero.  \nOur facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected  at various times of day and night\nthroughout the year.   Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing\ncalculation.\n\nWorst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is considered to be the release of the total contents of\nour largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85 %\ntank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 ppm)  miles based on EPAs RMP -Comp Program (Version 1.06), as\nwell as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to\nthe County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.   \n\nAlternative release scenario:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the\nsite.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose. \nTransfer hoses are protected by manual,  self closing excess flow , and pull away valves\nso our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose\nused (off loading transportation equipment).
