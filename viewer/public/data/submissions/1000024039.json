The maximum quantity on-hand exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 ( r ) of the Clean Air Act. \r\n\r\nThe City of Vinita and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. \r\n\r\nThe VWTP supplies drinking water to its customers and rural water districts.  Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before distribution and to maintain a chlorine residual to protect the water quality.  The chlorine supply is pulled from the ton container under a vacuum.  The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere in case of piping failure.  This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, which eliminates all pressure piping in the system.  At the chlorinator, the gas is converted to a solution, thereby minimizing any potential hazards.\r\n\r\nThe impact areas for both the worst case and alternate release scenarios were based on the results from RMP*Comp.  The worst case release scenario considered a one-ton release within a 10-minute period.  This resulted in a 1.3 mile radius impact area, with an estimated population of approximately 140 persons.  No active or inactive mitigation was considered in this scenario.  \r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario was based on a gas release created by a valve breaking from the one-ton container since the rest of the system operates either under a vacuum or in a solution.  A valve break at the container resulted in a release rate of 15 lbs/min of Cl2.  The impact area of this release was determined by RMP*Comp to have a radius of 0.1 miles.  Employees of the water plant would be the most likely effected by a chlorine leak at the plant.  The VWTP c"

However, consistent maintenance and regular training sessions will minimize the potential for a toxic release.\r\n\r\nThe VWTP has not had any reportable accidental chemical releases within the last five years.  If a release were to occur, then the chlorine gas detectors would notify plant personnel of the presence of chlorine gas.  Plant personnel would then call 9-1-1 to notify the fire department.  Next, personnel would contact the Vinita Emergency Response team.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required.  The fire department and emergency response team would work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of the release as drilled in accordance with the Vinita/Craig County Emergency Response Procedures manual.\r\n\r\nThe chemical feed system in place at the plant was installed in 1997 and updated in August 2011.  The system is in good working condition.  At this time, no improvements are planned."
