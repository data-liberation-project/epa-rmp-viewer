The Regulated Process\nThe only use for nitric acid at the Arkadelphia Facility is for Graphite Foil Production.  Nitric acid is stored in the segregated, locked and restricted nitric acid storage room.  The nitric acid is contained in a 6000 gallon aluminum tank, with a sidewall thickness of 5/16\".  The nitric acid tank is located inside an acid resistant coated secondary containment sump that is capable of holding 2.62 times the tank volume.  Nitric acid is supplied to the Graphite Foil Production by ~ 100' of 3/8\" PTFE tubing.  The total combined volume of the nitric acid delivery line at any one time is ~ 2 gallons. \n\n1.3. Offsite Consequences Analysis\n\nTwo offsite consequences analysis were conducted.  They include two nitric acid release scenarios.  The first is the EPA prescribed and unlikely \"worst case release.\"  The second is the more probable \"alternative release scenario.\" The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\"\n\nThe regulatory \"lookup\" tables in the \"RMP Offsite Consequences Analysis Guidance\", as presented in the USEPA supplied software package \"RMP*Comp\" , were used to determine the distance theoretically traveled by the released gas under specific atmospheric conditions before the concentration of the gas decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" specified at 40 cfr 68 Appendix A.  This endpoint is described by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected under each scenario.  The population residing in the resulting circle was estimated from the most recent U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census data using the Block Group Uniform Density Method as contained in the LandViewbIII Environmental Mapping Software obtained from the Bureau of the Census.  Included along with the population estimates are estimates of the number of institutional features and specified environmental receptors falling within the two circles.  Details of the Offsite Consequences Analyses effort and results are described in Section 3 of this Plan.\n\n1.3.1. Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario at the SGL Carbon Corporation, Arkadelphia Facility involves the failure of a 6000 gallon >98% White Fuming Nitric Acid storage vessel, the largest single storage vessel on site.  The scenario followed the conditions prescribed by EPA at 40 cfr 68.22 and 40 cfr 68.25.  EPA set this condition to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequences analyses in such a manner to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  The conditions were selected in order to provide very conservative results, i.e. large distance to endpoint, and may be unrealistic.  The Offsite Consequences Analysis yielded a distance to the endpoint of 0.3 miles. The analysis of the demographic data representing a circle around the facility with a radius equal to the endpoint distance yielded a population estimated at 3 including three manufacturing facilities, but no institutional facilities or environmental receptors.

Alternative Case Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario involved a faulty hose used to transfer received shipments of nitric acid from a delivery vehicle to the nitric acid storage tank.  The annual average temperature was provided by NOAA data from Hot Springs, AR. Other meteorological conditions assumed were those as contained in the \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\" This serves to describe a more plausible failure of containment occurring during more likely atmospheric conditions. The Offsite Consequence Analysis yielded a distance to the endpoint of 0.2 miles.  The analysis of the demographic data representing a circle around the facility with a radius equal to the endpoint distance yielded a population estimated at 1 including one manufacturing facility and no institutional facilities or environmental receptors.  A detailed discussion of the analysis of this scenario is contained in Section 3.5 of this Plan.\n\n\n1.4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBased upon the offsite consequences analysis and the requirement a PSM Program under the OSHA regulations at 29 cfr 1910.119, The SGL Carbon Corporation, Arkadelphia Facility's Accidental release Prevention Program is based upon the Level 3 Program requirements of 40 cfr 68.\n\n1.4.1. General facility Wide Release Prevention\nThe facility has an emergency response plan, which has been coordinated with the Arkadelphia Fire Department.  The Arkadelphia Fire Department is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This emergency response plan includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.  Internal emergency response drills are conducted quarterly  by the facility.  The Arkadelphia Fire Department has a standing invitation to participate in these drills.  Emergency operations and response procedures are evaluated as part of these drills.  Besides the specific emergency response program elements, "
