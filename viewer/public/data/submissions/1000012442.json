It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.  Numerous safety devices have been designed into the facility.  Safe work practices and training of all personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response personnel are trained to OSHA HAZMAT standards (40 hour) and also receive industrial fire brigade, first aid and CPR, and incident command training.  Our emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local Fire authority.  A detailed response plan identifies what we believe to be credible leak scenarios and actions to be taken to minimize any potential environmental or health issues.\n\nThe regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary function of this facility is the manufacturing of ultra-high purity polysilicon.  The only material handled at the facility that is above the EHS Threshold Quantity is Trichlorosilane.\n\n The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes.\n\nFive year accident history\n\nThe facility is a newly constructed facility and has had no accidents to date. \n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur emergency response personnel are trained to OSHA HAZMAT standards.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside age"

The employees will receive annual refresher training in their role in the plan.  Periodic drills will be conducted to review the effectiveness of our team and procedures.\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nThis is a new facility and is equipped with the safety measures required by all applicable laws and regulations as well as the relevant recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n"
