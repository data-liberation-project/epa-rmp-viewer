Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, ASV Wines - Pond has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 ASV Wines - Pond, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that ASV Wines - Pond has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                 | Process Chemical               | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration          Anhydrous Ammonia                12,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

The facility has four ammonia refrigeration systems that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\nProcess 1\n\n(6) Storage Tanks\n\n\n\nProcess 2\n\n(1) Wine Chiller\n\n\n\nProcess 3\n\n(1) Wine Chiller\n\n\n\nProcess 4\n\n(1) Wine Chiller\n\n(1) Glycol Chiller\n\n\n\nThe wine and glycol chillers are equipped with shell & tube heat exchangers and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The storage tanks are supplied by a liquid recirculator as required for a pumped overfeed system.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration machinery is contained within each outdoor machinery area. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nP1 Machinery Area\n\n(1) Reciprocating compressor\n\n(1) Oil separator\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(6) Storage tanks\n\n\n\nP2 Machinery Area\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(1) Oil separator\n\n(1) Shell and tube wine chiller\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n\n\nP3 Machinery Area\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(1) Oil separator\n\n(1) Shell and tube wine chiller\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n\n\nP4 Machinery Area\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(1) Oil separator\n\n(1) Shell and tube wine chiller\n\n(1) Shell and tube glycol chiller\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n(1) Thermosyphon vessel\n\n(1) Diffusion tank (all processes are piped to this diffusion tank)\n\n\n\nProcess 1 pumped overfeed system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is pipe"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each storage tank, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the storage tank.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nProcesses 2 thru 4 flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from each high pressure receiver is piped to each heat exchanger where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nEach system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\n\n \n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at ASV Wines consists of vessels, equipment, and valve which are inter"

It is believed that a leak from one system would impact the ability to operate another. Therefore, the ammonia refrigeration systems are treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nASV Wines - Pond has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the ASV Wines - Pond facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nASV Wines - Pond has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nASV Wines - Pond's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Em"

Nevertheless, ASV Wines - Pond continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved ASV Wines - Pond's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that ASV Wines - Pond's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nASV Wines - Pond has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for ASV Wines - Pond employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program ASV Wines - Pond will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
