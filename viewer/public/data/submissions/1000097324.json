Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Jasper Wyman & Son C&D Division are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Processing and storage of fruit (Blueberries).  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for  Industrial Refrigeration                                       .\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 46,251 lb.\n\nThe Jasper Wyman and Son, Inc. (Wyman's) Deblois facility maintain three separate anhydrous ammonia (NH3) refrigeration systems known as D1, D2, and D3.\n\n\n\nIn February 2020, American Refrigeration Company, Inc (ARC) of Andover, Massachusetts performed calculations based on system piping and vessel measurements to determine the estimated charge of NH3 for each system and its individual vessels.\n\n\n\nThe D1 refrigeration system has an estimated charge of 5,196 pounds (lbs.) of NH3 throughout the system. ARC pumped down the D1 system by closing the main liquid ammonia shut off valve (i.e., King valve) which causes most of the D1 ammonia to be drawn back into the D1 High Pressure Receiver (HPR).  The largest single vessel in the D1 system is the (HPR) with 4,987 lbs. of NH3.\n\n\n\nThe D2 refrigeration system has an estimated charge of 9,066 lbs. of NH3. ARC pumped down the D2 system by closing the King valve which causes most of the D2"

The largest single vessel in the D2 system is the HPR with 8,857 lbs. of NH3.\n\n\n\nThe D3 refrigeration system is the largest charged system at the facility with an estimated charge of 31,989 lbs. of NH3.  The largest single vessel in the D3 system is the HPR with 7,320 lbs. NH3.  However, the AeroFreeze Systems tunnel freezer air unit coil system contains an estimated 9,695 lbs. of NH3.\n\n\n\nCES reviewed the ARC survey in order to facilitate an Offsite Consequence Analysis which is required under the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, which implements Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments for certain toxic substances such as NH3. \n\n\n\nCES used the EPA's RMP*Comp program to perform offsite consequence analysis to help determine risk to nearby populations and to assist Wyman's in confirming or implementing steps to manage the risk as described in the RMP rule.  CES selected the largest on-site NH3 vessel, the D2 HPR (8,857 lbs.), for modeling Worst Case Scenario for the facility.  The D2 HPR is located (see drawing).\n\n\n\nFor an Alternative Scenario 1, CES selected process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, and drains or bleeds for modeling the scenario.  The model assumes the loss of 4,500 lbs. from D3 System piping and automatic activation of emergency exhaust ventilation, if indoors.\n\n\n\nFor an Alternative Scenario 2, CES selected a vessel leak for modeling this scenario.  The model assumes the loss of 1000 lbs. from D1 System vessels and automatic activation of emergency exhaust ventilation, if indoors.\n\n\n\nFor an Alternative Scenario 3, CES selected process piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, and valve seals, and drains or bleeds for modeling the scenario.\n\n\n\nThe model assumes the loss of 2000 lbs. from D3 System piping and automatic activation of emergency exhaust ventilation, if indoors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nJasper Wyman & Son C&D Division maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined) and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on January 8, 2016.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Jasper Wyman & Son C&D Division maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is annually reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nJasper Wyman & Son C&D Division has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
