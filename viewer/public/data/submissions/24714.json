      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe MEP Pleasant Hill, LLC, Aries Power Project (Plant) maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the RMP rule threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  The Plant will store the anhydrous ammonia in a 18,190 gallon tank with an administrative policy to not fill the tank beyond 80% capacity (i.e. 75,670 pounds).\n\nAnhydrous ammonia will be used at the Plant as an air pollution control system additive, to minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion turbine flue gas emissions.  The Plant is a combined cycle plant, consisting of two combustion turbines with heat recovery system and a common steam turbine generator.  Each combustion turbine is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. The anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan.  \n\nThe Plant is also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (codified in 29 CFR 1910.119) because it stores greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  As such, the facility is required to prepare a PSM plan.  The requirements of a PSM plan and RMP prevention program are essentially equivalent, and this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM plan.\n\nPLANT DESCRIPTION\nThe Plant is located in Cass County, Missouri, at 25111 E. 175th Street, Pleasant Hill.  The facility is located approximately 1.5-miles west of downtown Pleasant Hill and 1-mile east of the intersection of State Highway BB and E. 175th Street.  The property immediately surrounding the power plant is unimproved or used for agricultural purposes.  The topography is generally hilly with small pockets of woodlands along fence rows and hollows. \n\nAMMONIA SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nAn ammonia unloading and storage system is composed of four (4) major components: a tanker truck unloading station, ammonia storage tank, ammonia vaporization skid, and SCR equipment.  The tanker truck "

      "SummaryText": "unloading station is designed to provide a safe means of linking the ammonia delivery truck to the storage tank for the transfer of ammonia.  One 18,190-gallon horizontal tank is provided for anhydrous ammonia storage. The tank is situated in a concrete secondary containment berm.  A pressure regulator on the vapor outlet line of the storage tank maintains an outlet pressure of 30 - 60 PSIG at a flow rate of 25-244 lbs/hr to the SCR systems.  In the event that the ambient temperature outside the tank falls below a temperature that will generate enough heat to provide the 25-244 lbs/hr flow rate the SCR system requires, an ammonia vaporizer skid provides additional heating to keep an adequate vapor supply at the top of the storage tank.  Ammonia vapors drawn from the tank are regulated for pressure, mixed with air, and injected into the combustion turbine flues within each respective ammonia injection grid.  In combination with the catalyst in the SCR unit, nitrogen oxides are reacted and emissions of the pollutant are reduced.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was identified as the loss of the entire 18,190-gallon tank in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development.  The ammonia would be released as a gas.  As allowed in 40 CFR Part 68.25 (b)(1) of the RMP rule, administrative controls such as the company policy to fill the tank to a maximum of 80% liquid by volume, were taken into consideration in the evaluation of the mitigation of this release.  The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The area of potential impact was determined using RMP*Comp, modeling software provided by the EPA. \n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 4.9 miles under the specified weather conditions before dispersing in "

Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.  \n\nThis type of rapid release would occur only if the ammonia tank were breached.  The likelihood of such an incident occurring is miniscule.  Anhydrous ammonia tanks are installed with multiple safety systems to precisely prevent the release of an entire tank in a single event.  There have been no incidents of ammonia tank breaches reported in the nationwide EPA - Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office database.  \n\nAlso, in the event of a release, it is highly unlikely that the ammonia would disperse in a radial pattern given the weather conditions in Kansas City.  During a release, it is expected that an ammonia plume would disperse in the direction of the prevailing wind at the time of the event, as opposed to covering the entire area defined by a circle with a radius of 4.9 miles.      \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe alternative release scenario is, by definition, a more likely release scenario than the worst case.  Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves, ammonia vapor leak detection system and alarms and water fogging system are considered in the analysis.  \n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the storage tank and the vaporizers.  As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow rate that would not cause the tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut.  The leak was assumed to continue until the sounding of the ammonia vapor detector alarm, at which time the operator would be alerted to check the ammonia system. The main isolation valve "

If the ammonia vapor concentration proved unsafe for facility response, the Pleasant Hill Fire Department would be called to respond to the emergency.  The estimated worst case time from leak detection to complete response for the Fire Department in the alternate release scenario is 45 minutes.  \n\nThe results of the Off-Site Consequence Analysis using RMP*Comp, indicated that the ammonia would travel approximately 0.3 miles (1600 feet) under the specified weather conditions before dispersing to the toxic end point concentration. Within this radius from the ammonia tank, an estimated 10 persons could potentially be affected in addition to plant employees and contractors.  Maps of the area and a list of the types of receptors in the potential impact area are provided in the Off-Site Impact Analysis Section.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA process hazard assessment was performed on the ammonia system using a Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) type safety review.  The ammonia tank and associated systems were reviewed for compliance with the American National Standards Institute standards for ammonia (ANSI K-61.1 - American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section VIII, Division 1.  Compliance with code requirements regarding the storage tanks, unloading station, piping system, vaporizers, air dilution equipment and ammonia injection grid as well as operational practices and protocols associated with anhydrous ammonia management were assessed.  A copy of each HAZOP is provided in the Process Hazard Analysis Section.  \n\nDuring the HAZOP analysis the entire system was methodically assessed/evaluated.  Points in the system where ammonia could potentially be released were identified.  Potential failure points, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each elemen"

Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section.  The Hazard Assessment will be reviewed in detail when the systems installations are complete and will be reviewed at a minimum of once every five (5) years.\n\nPREVENTION SYSTEM\nThe Plant has operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system.  The Plant Engineer maintains an Operation and Maintenance manual prepared by the ammonia system manufacturer.  Plant personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the system.\n\nThe ammonia systems are visually inspected once per shift on a 24-hour per day basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia system have been incorporated into the plant's operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  Personnel will receive training prior to being allowed to work on the ammonia system.  Additional training materials from the Ammonia Institute will be used to conduct personnel training.  The facility will coordinate an ammonia emergency response training exercise with the Pleasant Hill Fire Department and local hazardous material response team.  \n\nThe ammonia tank and vaporizer skid are located within a concrete berm to contain potential spills and leaks.  This equipment is located outdoors to better ventilate the area.  Four ammonia sensors are installed within the containment area that will indicate leaks.  A water fogging system has been provided to cool the tank and piping in the event of a fire.\n\nThe ammonia storage tank is equipped with a temperature indicator, liquid level indicator, liquid level transmitter, pressure indicator, pressure transmitter and"

      "SummaryText": " four (4) vapor relief valves each capable of venting 33% of the maximum tank capacity.  Liquid outlets from the tank are equipped with excess flow check valves that will prevent the tank from emptying in the event of a piping breakage.  The vapor outlet from the tank to the SCR system is equipped with an automatic block valve and regulator assembly that shuts the flow of ammonia vapors in the event of an ammonia leak or plant failure.  Hydrostatic relief valves are located throughout the piping network to prevent piping from being damaged when isolated and filled with ammonia.  Multiple manual shut-off valves are located throughout the system to facilitate direct response in case of an incident.\n\nUnloading of ammonia from tanker trucks will be attended by the delivery driver and a Plant operator during the transfer event.  The unloading station consists of a liquid fill line and vapor return line between the storage tank and tanker truck to properly equalize pressure during unloading.  Both lines are equipped with quick disconnect fittings and check valves that allow a safe disconnect in the event the truck pulls away from the unloading station prematurely.  Both lines are equipped with emergency shutoff valves that will allow the operator to manually stop the flow of ammonia.  Each emergency shutoff valve has a remote cable so that they can be operated at a safe distance from the truck.  The station is equipped with a level indicator that displays the level of fluid in the storage tank to prevent overfilling.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nThe Plant's Emergency Response Plan was modified to address ammonia incident response.  Plant personnel will be trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by shutting off key emergency valves.  The Pleasant Hill Fire Department will perform any response requiring entry into a dangerous atmosphere or situation.
