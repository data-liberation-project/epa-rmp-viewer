An outline of the RMP Program is provided in Table ES-1.  The disinfection process using chlorine is covered under this regulation at the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans (S&WB) Algiers Water Purification Plant (WPP).\nTo meet the regulation requirements, this report contains useful information on the chlorine system.  The technical information contained in this report may be used as a reference in initial and recurring operator training.  Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nTable ES-1\nOutline of RMP Program\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nWorst-Case Scenarios\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n5-year Accident History\nMANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nDocument Management System\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nSafety Information\nHazard Review\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMaintenance\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audit\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are also included in the report.  These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\nPrint outs from the RMP*Submit 2004, which summarizes the RMP in the format required by the EPA, are included in Section 12 of this document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for inclusion in a public access database.  The RMP is intended to inform the public of Algiers WPP\u00bfs proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nES.1 Hazard Assessment\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the chlorine system, as well as a 5-Yea"

The physical data will provide useful information in the inevitable event the plant process is modified, thereby requiring revisited dense gas dispersion modeling.  It is also imperative that plant operators and managers are aware of the potential health hazards and exposure limits associated with chlorine.\n\nES.4.3 Process Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information was meticulously compiled on each system studied. Basic specifications on each process are included in this document for easy reference. Details such as Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are provided in this section. Used as a training reference, together with the Process Schematics, the reader will readily understand the function and operation of the plant chlorine system.\n\nES.5 Hazard Review\nThe Hazard Review conducted for the chlorine system in 1999 has been reviewed and updated.  Progress made to date on the 1999 recommendations is also provided.\nRecommendations\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement.  Rule 40 CFR 68.50 requires the S&WB to ensure that problems identified are resolved in a timely manner.  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with responsibility for each assigned to the appropriate personnel.  \nRecommendations from 1999 that are still in the process of being completed include the following:\n?Install gas filters before the chlorinators.\n?Consider the installation of ceiling mounted room heaters rather than portable space heaters\n?Evaluate feasibility of hiring an additional Health and Safety Officer to assist with the training, regulatory compliance, and health and safety concerns\n\nES.6 Op"

They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine gas system. Procedures include Start-up, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation. Also included are Troubleshooting Procedures.\n\nES.7 Training\nTraining is required by the EPA to be included in the RMP Program. A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required documentation.  \n\nES.8 Maintenance\nBasic chlorine system maintenance procedures have been developed with associated documentation forms and are available at the facility for operators\u00bf use. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, as well as to the off-site public.  In the event of an inspection or compliance review, state and federal regulators will request to see documentation and record keeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nES.9 Incident Investigation\nAn Incident Investigation Program has also been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving the chlorine system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learns from the incident and takes action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nES.10 Compliance Audits\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document.

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Algiers WPP falls.  Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Algiers\u00bf Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I.  The Algiers Water Purification Plant is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program III.  Algiers Water Purification Plant is included in RMP II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Section 1.\n\nES.1.1 Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is defined as a 1-ton container (2,000 pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration. A passive mitigation factor is allowed for this process due to the building which encloses the chlorine system. This scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP*Comp software. The toxic endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 0.9 miles for RMP Comp at the 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n\nES.1.2 Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) of chlorine was also modeled using RMP*Comp. An estimation of approximately 348 pounds of chlorine gas released during 30 minutes was derived from the scenario of a flexible connection failure.  This release is contained within the chlorine storage room.  The Algiers WPP has a scrubbing system as a means of chlorine release active mitigation, which may be considered when modeling alternative release scenarios.  The scrubber is sized to neutralize the 2000 pounds of chlorine (the entire contents of a 1-ton container.)  As a result, the release would be entirely neutralized in the chlorine system room and the radius of impact would effectively be zero.\n\nES.2 Five-year Accident History\nNo major accidents resulting"
