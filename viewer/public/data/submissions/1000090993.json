This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The UGI Energy Services policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nUGI Energy Services operates the Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant located in Mahoning County, Ohio. This facility is a 200 MMscf/d Chilling and Expansion System consisting of a Molecular Sieve Dehydration System, Mechanical Refrigeration, Turbo Expander/Compressor and Demethanizer tower.  These systems are utilized to drop the temperature of the inlet gas and remove condensed Natural Gas Liquids (NGL's) from the inlet gas stream. The NGLs descend down the tower to the surge tank where they are pumped through the NGL pipeline. The residue natural gas comprised mostly of methane flows from the top of the tower and is recompressed for pipeline delivery.  NGLs may also be stored in tanks onsite when the NGL pipeline is not available.  This facility is classified as a Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five (5) years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant. Because plant processes are subject to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident "

      "SummaryText": "prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nUGI Energy Services actively encourages all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information. Employees are involved in maintaining Process Safety Management (PSM) rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nUGI Energy Services maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters. Employees within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using trained personnel, process controls, monitoring and protective instrument systems. The plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. UGI Energy Services primarily uses the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations. This technique is recognized as one (1) of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. UGI Energy Services assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates. The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant maintains written Operating Procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1)    Initial startup.\n\n(2)    Normal operations. \n\n(3)    Temporary operations.\n\n(4)    Emergency shutdown. \n\n(5)    Emergency operations. \n\n(6)    Normal shutdown. \n\n(7)    Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.
