      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nBridgeview Aerosol, LLC is a custom packager specializing in aerosol consumer, industrial, institutional, and commercial products. Included in these types of products are items such as spray paints, automobile maintenance products, household products, and industrial and institutional products.  The overall production process is a highly integrated operation involving management of incoming chemical and non-chemical raw materials; compounding, blending, mixing and storage of the chemical raw materials into packageable forms; packaging of these compounded materials into aerosol containers; and the temporary accumulation of these packages in warehousing areas prior to shipment.\n\nOur physical plant site consists of two buildings located on approximately 8.5 acres.  The main building, located centrally within the property, contains office, laboratory, warehousing, production, maintenance, and shipping and receiving areas.  The other building, designated Building 6, contains laboratory, warehousing, production, and shipping and receiving areas.  The plant site also has a propellant storage tank farm that contains 20 tanks; three underground storage tank fields containing 45 tanks; one aboveground storage tank area containing one tank; two tank truck off-loading areas; and a propellant off-loading area.  It is the propellant storage tank farm and the related process of packaging aerosol cans that is the subject of this Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe tanks in the propellant storage tank farm range in size from 1,840 gallons to 30,000 gallons.  The total capacity of these tanks is 189,000 gallons, but our internal operating guidelines limits the maximum amount to 170,000 gallons.  The materials stored are propane, butane, various blends of these two materials and difluoroethane.  Only propane and butane are stored in the 30,000 gallon tanks; all blends and the other propellant are stored in smaller tanks.\n\n\nAPPROACH TO SAFETY\n\nAt Bridgeview Aerosol, we a"

We know that many of the raw materials we use are hazardous and that proper operating procedures and employee training programs will minimize the risks associated with those hazards.  We have established many operating procedures and have enacted employee safety training programs, both on our own and in conjunction with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, as well as applicable state codes and regulations, that are designed to prevent system failures that could endanger our employees and the community.  We maintain an open dialogue with the local fire departments, in addition to an open door policy, that encourages cooperation and guidance.  To prevent unintended access by third parties, we do restrict access to the facility to employees, authorized contractors and authorized visitors.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs described earlier, we are committed to operating our plant safely.  In order to acomplish this, we have reviewed all standard operating procedures, including those required by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, as well as those that we developed in order to maintain our operation.  We train our employees in those procedures that they are expected to follow in performing their duties and provide review training at appropriate intervals.  We installed and maintain automatic devices designed to prevent and respond to the release of the materials involved in our operation.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOn March 6, 2006, an explosion with a fire ball occurred in one of our batch mixing tanks.  The fire ball consumed all available vapors and no extinguishing steps were needed.  The explosion and fire were caused by an unknown ignition source that ignited solvent vapors that occupied the vapor headspace of the mixing tank.

All safety measures were reviewed and no changes were made.  Work practices involving the affected mixing processes were extensively reviewed and it was determined that a static charge build up was the most likely cause of the ignition.  The incident did not involve the propellant storage area.  There were no off-site consequences.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, a fire occurred in one of our batch mixing tanks.  It was immediately extinguished by the employees that were working in the area.  The fire apparently was caused by a spark that ignited solvent vapors that were generated during the processing of the batch.  The spark was likely the result of a static charge build-up that was caused by the mixing of hydrocarbon solvent in the vessel.  No employees were injuried; physical damage was minor.  Operations continued the next day after cleanup of the affected area.  All safety measures were reviewed and appropriate changes were made.  The incident did not involve the propellant storage area.  There were no off-site consequences.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, a fire occurred in a 55 gallon drum that was used to collect off-spec aerosol cans.  It was immediately by the employees that were working in the area.  The fire apparently was the result of a spark caused by the improper placement of an aerosol can into the drum  that ignited solvent vapors that were present in the drum.  No employees were injuried; physical damage was minor.  Operations continued the same day after cleanup of the affected area.  All safety measures were reviewed and appropriate changes were made.  The incident did not involve the propellant storage area.  There were no off-site consequences.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, an explosion with a fire occurred in one of our batch mixing tanks.

Situations covered by our plan include fires, tornadoes, hazardous materials incidents, and personal injuries.  Actions to be taken in these situations include initial fire fighting measures, evacuations, hazardous materials containment procedures, and appropriate first-aid measures.\n\nAll employees are trained in the proper methods of plant evacuation in the event of a fire.  Members of the safety team receive additional training in order to assist  in plant response emergencies so that efficient plant evacuations can be effected and that equipment can be secured in apppropriate manners until professional help arrives.  Some safety team members, as first responders, also receive portable fire extinguisher training.\n\nAll fire alarms, whether remotely sensed or manually activated, are automatically transmitted to the local fire department for response.

However, if we become aware of a situation  that provides for additional operational safety and it requires changes to our overall operating plan, we will not hesitate to evaluate the proposal and make whatever changes that are necessary."
