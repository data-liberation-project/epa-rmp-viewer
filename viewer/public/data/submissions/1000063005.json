In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the PSM/RM programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs contain the following major elements:\n\n?     General Company Policy\n\n?     Employee Participation\n\n?     Process Safety Information\n\n?     Process Hazard Analysis\n\n?     Standard Operating Procedures\n\n?     Training\n\n?     Contractor Qualifications\n\n?     Pre Startup Safety Review\n\n?     Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n?     Hot Work Permit\n\n?     Management of Change\n\n?     Incident Investigation\n\n?     Emergency Planning and Response\n\n?     Compliance Audits\n\n?     Trade Secrets\n\n?     Hazard Assessment\n\n?     Management System\n\n?     Five Year Accident History\n\n?     Preparing a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\n\n\nThe Environmental, Health and Safety Manager is the program coordinator with overall responsibility to ensure that program goals and objectives are met and appropriate resources are available. The Environmental, Health and Safety Manager will review and update"

      "SummaryText": " the program as necessary. Copies of the written program may be reviewed through employee communications processes, safety training/audits, and system audits.\n\nIf you feel that any improvements can be made to the PSM/RM programs, please contact the Environmental, Health and Safety Manager. We encourage all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our PSM/RM programs. We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system which obtains clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of the facility and the public.\n\nThe RMP identifies possible worst-case scenarios which could pose health risks to employees and outside receptors if a Formaldehyde release were to occur. At Kronochem, the failure of one of the main storage tanks in the tank farm would be considered a worst-case scenario if a failure were to occur. This vessel has a volume of 300 m3 with a maximum of 55% Formaldehyde at any one time. Based upon a maximum fill capacity of the tank of 90%, the total amount of Formaldehyde that could be released in a worst-case scenario would be making a total release 642,000 lbs of Formaldehyde.  With a release of this magnitude, the Toxic Endpoint is approximately 1.6 miles, which means the vapor would travel approximately 1.6 miles before reaching the 0.012 mg/L level, which is considered a safe level. The probability of a failure in this vessel system is very low due to the PM program by Kronochem staff and licensed contractors, the automated level control system, and the daily operational inspections. Furthermore, significant alarms would notify personnel of such a failure and corrective action would be possible to minimize the release.\n\n17.3 General Company Policy\n\n"
