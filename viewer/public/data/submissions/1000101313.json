These safe work practices used include (1) lockout procedures for control of hazardous energy, (2) entry/exit control procedures for maintenance, laboratory, contractor, and support personnel, (3) line breaking/opening process equipment procedures, (4) a hot work permit program to control possible ignition sources, and (5) a permit-required confined space entry procedure. These procedures are used by all personnel involved in both user and non-user maintenance activities.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):\nThe site's management of change program is intended to review and evaluate changes to process chemistry, operating conditions or limits, equipment, and procedures before changes are made so as to prevent unexpected adverse impacts. The management of change program uses a quantitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change. This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action. Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes that are not suited to the service as it exists in the process. Another feature of the management of change program is that it verifies and documents that procedures, records, and equipment information are updated and that personnel affected by the change are informed of and trained in the change.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nAll incidents that result in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a release of a hazardous material, a fire or explosion in a covered process area, major property damage, adverse environmental impact, or serious personal injury must be reported and promptly investigated. By investigating accidents and near-misses, important lessons are learned. Corrective actions can then be implemented to prevent similar events in the future. Incident investigations are docum"

This review provides additional verification that construction is in accordance with design specifications and that systems are operationally ready. Applicable checklists are used to verify various aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of equipment fabrication and installation and serves to assure that other accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nThe LeMoyne site assures the mechanical integrity of critical operations equipment such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and safety systems through its mechanical integrity program. The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity (MI) program include: (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Maintenance personnel receive training in (1) overviews of the process and its hazards, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner. Equipment deficiencies, once identified, are corrected prior to further operation of the equipment, or a management team will determine and prescribe how the equipment may continue safely in operation.
