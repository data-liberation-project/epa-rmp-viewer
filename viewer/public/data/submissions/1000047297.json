Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Tyson Foods Inc to implement a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68. Included in this process is the implementation of OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of implementing these programs is to prevent the release of anhydrous ammonia. By doing so we protect employees and guests on site while protecting the general public off site. \n\n\n\nAs part of these programs, Tyson Foods has developed an emergency response plan that includes a well trained response team that coordinates closely with local fire department and other off site emergency personnel.\n\n\n\nII. The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nAmmonia for refrigeration-amount of regulated substance-(45,553 pounds).\n\n\n\nTyson Refrigerated Processed Meats, Portwall is a food manufacuring facility located in a heavy industrial section of Houston Texas. \n\n\n\nThe food production process at this facility requires very low temperatures to process and maintain the finished product. The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia to provide the proper temperature in the production areas, coolers and blast freezers. \n\n\n\nIII. General accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention.\n\n\n\nA. Tyson Refrigerated Processed Meats, Portwall Facility  has designed and implemented a preventative maintenance program to reduce the potential for release of ammonia from the refrigerations system. This program complies with the requirements of OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. The key concept of this release prevention program is employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment and appropriate training of all Tyson Team Members.\n\n\n\nIV. Five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThere have not been any releases of anhydrous ammonia at this facility "
