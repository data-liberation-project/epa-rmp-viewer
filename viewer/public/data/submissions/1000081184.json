The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Chlorination and Sulfonation Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* specific chemical inventories.\n \nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  \nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and other chemicals used in our process.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant also maintai"

The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenarios (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine or sulfur dioxide would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "City of Buena Vista\nWastewater Treatment Plant\nRisk Management Program\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe City of Buena Vista has a long-standing commitment to operating our facilities in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment.  A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant system to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination and sulfonation processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\nProgram Level: 3\nRegulated Substance:"
