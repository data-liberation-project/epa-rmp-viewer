The employees receive periodic refresher training and participate in annual emergency response exercises.\n\nDeltech Resin Company manufactures synthetic resin at the facility.  It uses Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomer \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf CAS# 26471-62-5) for manufacturing urethanes.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is a regulated substance under the \u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfAccidental Release Prevention\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bf regulation, under the Clean Air Act, Section 112 (r) (7).  Deltech procures, stores and handles TDI only in 55 gallon drums to minimize any potential release of TDI.  \n\nDeltech Resin manufactures acylic polymers. They are regulated as \"reactive Hazards\" under the NJ TCPA program as their heat of reaction exceed 100 cal/gm.\n\nThere has not been any accidental release of TDI since Deltech acquired the facility in 2005.  \n\nThe preventative steps taken at the facility to minimize accidental release of TDI and any consequences of a release include:\n\n1.\tThe facility does not handle TDI in bulk.  TDI is only handled in 55-gallon drums.  \n\n2.\tTDI is stored in a separate room in the warehouse.  The room is separated from the flammable material in the warehouse with a fire door and fire wall.  \n\n3.\tThe TDI room is provided with a sprinkler system.  \n\n4.\tThe TDI room is equipped with a TDI monitor with alarm to detect any spills of TDI in the room. \n\n5. Acrylic polymerization reactors are provided with rupture disc. T6 line discharges to a foam over tank in case of rupture of the disc.\n\nDeltech Resin Company has a Combined Emergency Response Plan (Plant Operation #59) to respond to any emergency at the facility.  A copy of the plan has been distributed to all local emergency responders and plant emergency response members.  All new employees are provided with initial orientation training.  Annual refresher training is provided to all employees.  In addition, the emergency response team participates in annual emergenc"

These items have included the procuring TDI monitors, minimizing the TDI inventory, having a separate room for TDI storage with fire doors and walls, obtaining a sprinkler system and a TDI monitor for the TDI storage room, installing alarms for the processes using TDI and training employees in safe operation and emergency response.  We believe that as a result of these items, TDI operations at the facility are safe."
