[68.155(a)]\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled? [68.155(b)]\n\n\n\nPropane is the regulated substance that is managed at the Airgas USA, LLC fill plant in Memphis, TN.  Propane is delivered to this location via third party and placed inside a stationary bulk storage tank. Propane is transferred from the bulk storage tank into propane cylinders that are manufactured to DOT specifications.  The Memphis fill plant distributes the full propane cylinders to Airgas retail stores for distribution to customers.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps? [68.155(c)]\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to propylene and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n2.5.4 The five-year accident history? [68.155(d)]\n\n\n\nThe propane system is a newly covered process and has not been involved in an accidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or death within the past 5 years.  In addition, an accidental release has not lead to a resp"

[68.155(e)]\n\n\n\nEmployees of the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 228 and Appendix Tab 312 for additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Planned changes to improve safety? [68.155(f)]\n\n\n\nImplementation of the RMP processes produced many changes that improved safety.  Please refer to the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log for additional information. During the Process Hazard Analysis, which included a thorough review of process equipment and procedures, a number of action items were identified to improve the overall safety for this facility.  Future improvements will be summarized on the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log.\n\n"
