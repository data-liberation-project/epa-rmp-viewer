      "SummaryText": "We have never had a major release with the ammonia-If it does happen the employees are trained on what to do and who to call. Sometimes it could be a vavle that wasn't shut off completely and the employees are trained to wear their proctecting attire and try and fix the problem. If it is a major leak their are told to stay away and contact the proper authorities.  The primary activity at this plant is custom application of chemicals and fertilizer on farm ground. Most ammonia is sold to farmers in nurse tanks holding 3600# in the months of June and July. Worst case would be if something would happen to the large tank holding 40,000#. If we lost the whole tank in 10 minutes with the wind blowing 1.5 mph it would travek 1.10 miles. Depending won which direction the wind is blowing it could affect anywhere from 20-300 people. In the winter months we inspect the tanks for worn hoses, water tank leakage and safety equipment. We also inspect the tanks durning the summer as we refill them. The employees are also given a review on all safety requirments. We are included in the ER Plan for the city and the county. If the worse case senerico would happen we are to call 911 and the residents would be notitied by TV and by vehicle. The fire department would automatically respond. It is a pre planned exercise in the ER Plan for the city and county iof Dignton. Contact person is Delmar Dunham ER Plan coordinator for the city of Dighton and Lane county."
