      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\n2005 Update\n\n\n\nChemical storage and use at the Water Reclamation Plant remains the same and has not had any changes made to it since the last RMP submition in 1999.  The plant is currently in the process of a major expansion and upgrade.  The expansion will increase wastewater treatment capabilities by approximately 25%. The upgrade will replace the existing pumping station and preliminary treatment.  It will also expand the sludge thickening and storage capacities.  None of these changes or additions will alter the use or storage of chemicals.  As a part of the plant upgrade, a chlorine gas scrubber system will be installed to evacuate and neutralize any leaks which occur inside the storage building.  This would be considered a mechanical mitigation.  When the system is installed the WRP's RMP and PSM will be reviewed and updated.  Since chlorine cylinders will still off-loaded outside of the building the \"worse case scenario\" will remain unchanged.  \n\n\n\nThe Purpose of the Risk Management Plan\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities, which use potentially hazardous material, to assess the risks of any accidental release and develop a plan to minimize these risks.  These regulations are referred to as the Risk Management Plan and are found in section 112r of The Clean Air.  It is the intent of these regulations to reduce the number of offsite injuries and death that could occur from the accidental release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\n\nWhat this Regulation Covers\n\n\n\nThe Rochester Water Reclamation Plant is the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) which treats the wastewater from the City of Rochester and its residents under the authority of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  As a wastewater treatment plant the Rochester Water Reclamation Plant uses chemical that are common to the industry, including chlorine.  Chlorine is regulated under the risk management plan when used in quantities greater "

Chlorine is stored in one ton (2,000 pound cylinders).  \n\n\n\nChlorine\n\n\n\nThe Water Reclamation Plant is required by its NPDES permit to continuously disinfect its discharge from April through November of every year.  Chlorine has been used for many years as an economical safe, effective agent for disinfection.  To ensure that disinfection is not interrupted when changing chlorine cylinders, it is common in the wastewater industry to have multiple cylinders connected at one time.  Once a cylinder is exhausted the system automatically switches over to the back-up cylinders, thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply to meet the continuous disinfection.  Because more than one cylinder is hooked up at a time, the process is considered to have greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine in it at one time.  Thus the Risk Management program rules apply.  \n\n\n\nOther Alternatives\n\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to obtain chlorine in smaller 150 pound cylinders, this size is impractical for use at the Water Reclamation Plant.  The use of 150 pound cylinder at the Water Reclamation Plant would exhaust more than one cylinder every day.  Although the use of these smaller cylinders would eliminate the need for complying with the Risk Management Plan it would create a greater hazard in the number of connections which have to be made.  Connecting and changing of cylinders is an operation that can potentially cause an accidental release.  Therefore, an appropriate sized cylinder is the safest all around alternative.  Chlorine is also available in larger rail car sized containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Not Regulated\n\n\n\nAlthough the Water Reclamation Plant uses other chemicals, none of them are used in quantities above regulated threshold quantities.  The Water Regulation Plant does neutralize the chlorine discharge prior to mixing with the receiving stream, the South Fork of the Zumbro River.  Instead of using a regulated chemical such as sulfur dioxide, the Wa"

This is a worst case scenario, which assumes the entire contents of a one ton cylinder escapes within a ten minute period of time.  This scenario assumes a worst case wind speed of 1.5 mile per hour, 25o C and a F stability.

This alternative scenario is calculated based on a release the release of the entire content of a chlorine cylinder over a period of eighteen minutes.  This is less than the rate of release for the worst case scenario because it takes into account the mitigating effect of the chlorine cylinders being inside.  This alternative scenario represent an accidental release that is more to occur than that of the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nOffsite Receptors \n\n\n\nIn the worst case scenario the 1.3 mile distance to endpoint would include a large residential area, several schools, public parks and business establishments.  The estimated population within that distance is 3,600 person using the Block Group Proportion Method.  This is the estimated population within the entire 1.3 mile radius around the facility.  Under either of the two scenarios the wind would limit the area impacted by a release to an actual area of less than 180o, , or half of the area of the entire circle.  In the case of an actual release it would be up to the emergency response to decide on the appropriate action to take.
