      "SummaryText": "KIK Georgia (KIK) produces household cleaning products and product bottles at its Hampton Georgia facility.  Its principal product is household bleach.  This Risk Management Plan is submitted for the chlorine that is stored and used at the facility for the production of household bleach (sodium hypochlorite).  Aqueous ammonia is also stored  at the plant, but is present in quantities below the RIsk Management Program rule applicability thresholds, and is therefore not included in this Plan.\n\nChlorine is received at the plant in 90 ton tank cars.  These tank cars are hooked up to the hypochlorite process directly and serve as the storage for chlorine used in the process.  KIK's siding can store up to 6 railcars, but routinely has 2-4 railcars on site at any one time, but only one tank car is in use at any given time.  The siding used for the chlorine tank car storage abuts the hypochlorite processing area, so that all pipe lengths for the chlorine process are relatively short.  An operator is on-hand at all times while chlorine is being used by the process, so response times to any release are within minutes.\n\nIt should be noted that KIK chose to not consider the potential release control that could be provided by the excess flow valves on the chlorine tank car outlets in its alternative release scenario. This choice was based on the fact that the maintenance and quality control of the excess flow valves is not under direct control of KIK, and excess flow valves have some history of failure in the field.\n\nKIK Georgia operates using a Process Safety Management Program for chlorine in accordance with OSHA 1910.119.  As such, the facility maintains training and maintenance programs to provide the maximum in release prevention for this operation.  The hypochlorite production process also uses a hypochlorite batch controller with alarm horns and an emergency shutoff of chlorine flows to prevent over chlorination of a hypochlorite batch.  This controller incorporates a red"

This plan has been coordinated with the Henry County Fire Department.  Elements of the plan include procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine release for on-site response, first aid, public notification and evacuation, coordination with the Fire Department, and reporting to the Environmental Protection Division.  Training for the Emergency Response Hazmat Team is conducted annually and drills are conducted quarterly.    \n\nThe KIK Georgia facility is committed to the protection of the health and safety of its employees, the neighboring community and the environment. KIK is diligent in maintaining programs and procedures that will aid in preventing and minimizing any potential future releases of chlorine from the site."
