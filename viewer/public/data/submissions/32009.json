The Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policy\nVan Diest Supply Company?s accidental release prevention policy is a unified approach that integrates technology, procedure, and management practices, while complying with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations for our anhydrous ammonia storage.  If an accidental release were to occur, Van Diest Supply Company is prepared and trained to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and to the environment.\n\nB.   A Brief Description of the Facility and the Substances Handled\nVan Diest Supply Company is a distributor and dealer of agricultural chemicals, and a dealer of fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application on the field.  Two 30,000 gallon vessels are used to store the anhydrous ammonia, with the largest amount in either vessel at any time 130,000 pounds (based on 85% fill limit).  There may also be up to 60 nurse tanks on site, with each nurse tank having a capacity of 6,200 pounds.  \n\nC.   The Accidental Release Prevention Program\nFor our ammonia tanks, Van Diest Supply Company implements the provisions of the ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia, K-61.1? published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and Handling of Ammonia?.\n\nImpact distances for any release will be limited by mitigation devices such as check valves, relief valves, and excess flow valves, as well as the training of our employees in our Emergency Response Program.\n\nD.   Five Year Accident History\nVan Diest Supply Company has never had an incident involving  ammonia which caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations. \n\nE.   Emergency Response Program\nVan Diest Supply Company has a written emergency"

Both of these have been coordinated with the Region V Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Van Diest Supply Company.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
