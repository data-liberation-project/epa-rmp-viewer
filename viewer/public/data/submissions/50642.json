      "SummaryText": "\nA.Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nBecause of the importance of good moral, a good employee relationship, high cost of injury and illness and the high cost of company property, Lanier Cold Storage requires that its management and employees follow all safety programs to ensure a safe and friendly work environment.  It is our belief that no work is so important to overlook the safety programs in place.  It is also our belief that all management is responsible for ensuring that any and all employees have a safe work place and to enforce all safety rules and regulations.  It is our belief that all employees are responsible for following the safety rules and regulations.  Therefore, by following these procedures Lanier Cold Storage will provide a safe and friendly work environment for its employees while also preventing damage to company property and will comply with all applicable safety and health regulations.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHAS Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAS Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant release of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handles\n\nThe Lanier Cold Storage facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product stored in frozen, refrigerated, or dry warehouse and then loaded and distributed by tractor trailer to various customers.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigera"

The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 47,000 pounds.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program #3 requirements of the EPAS RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for the use in the preservation and processing of perishable food products.  Through the use of single stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25 F and 25 F.  The higher the pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the recirculator vessel V-1 High Pressure Receiver.  A worst-case release from this vessel includes an estimated 5,846 pound of ammonia.  Assumed is that the release occurs through a 0.65 inch circular hole located at the bottom of the vessel.  For this Worst-Case Release Scenario, the distance from the source to toxic endpoint is 0.90 miles.  The worst case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon; Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the vessels; Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the vessels and vessels have design margins of safet"

      "SummaryText": "y of about 4 to 1.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is chosen as a pipe failure.  The potential for a pipe failure is possible given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility and, as such, represents a more realistic event than the catastrophic failure of a vessel.  Assumed is the failure of a 1 inch pipe connected to the V-1 High Pressure Receiver.  Using EPA suggested meteorological parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 miles.  The Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release; Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines; Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.  Vessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.  Active mitigation would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits the system to equalize to 50-60 psig.\n\nD.Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation\nOperating Procedures\nProcess Safety Information\nTraining\nContractors\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nHot Work Permit\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nPre-startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\n\nE.Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years\n\nF.Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the Hall County EMA.\n\nG.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on 06/14/2007.  Any recommendations from this analysis will be evaluated and imp"
