This facility was previously owned by ENI and operated under the names, EniChem Elastomers Americas Inc., EniChem Americas Inc., and Polimeri Europa.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulated flammable materials at this facility is 1,3-butadiene. One toxic material, dimethyldichlorosilane is maintained at this location above the threshold limit.\r\n\r\nThe process is a continuous batch reaction in which a styrene butadiene co-block polymer is produced. After the rubber is formed, the solvent is steam stripped and the polymerized material is carried to the finishing and packaging section in a water slurry. After the rubber undergoes a drying and cooling process, it is packaged in boxes, bags, or sacks. On site storage space is adequate for inventory and shipping of all product.\r\n\r\nLCY Elastomers LP has not had an accidental release since the plant began operation in 1992.\r\n\r\nAlong with the RMP regulations, LCY Elastomers LP is also regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations. This regulation duplicates many of the requirements promulgated by the RMP rule. LCY Elastomers LP risk management program involves the use of state of the art process control systems and equipment in the safest working condition. Personnel are also trained on emergency response procedures for handling situations that could present a hazard to equipment or personnel within the facility or outside the boundaries of company property. Procedures are reviewed on an annual basis and personnel receive both on-site and off-site training to prepare for incidents that presents a hazard. LCY Elastomers LP participates in the Baytown Community Advisory Panel, a group comprised of Baytown citizens and industry management. This group meets monthly to allow cit"
