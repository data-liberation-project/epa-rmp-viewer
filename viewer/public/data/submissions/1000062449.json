Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPacific Urethanes is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the community, and the environment. As part of this commitment, Pacific Urethanes has established a Risk Management Program to help the company identify and communicate risks associated with our operations. Reasonable controls have been installed to prevent accidental releases from occurring. Site specific plans for emergency response have been developed to reduce the effects upon our employees and the general public in the highly unlikely event of a release of hazardous materials from the facility. \n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\n\n\nPacific Urethanes has developed a risk management program to address the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program requirements (40 CFR 68) due to the onsite process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantity.\n\nThe regulated chemical, Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), with a CAS # 26471-62-5, is present at the facility in quantities above its 10,000-pound threshold.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nPacific Urethanes is dedicated to continuous improvement of its environmental, health and safety program. Pacific Urethanes' employees have been trained and provided with detailed information concerning their job duties and chemicals stored onsite. Employees have also been trained on the facility's Emergency Reporting Program.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no RMP applicable releases of toxic materials in the past five (5) years. \n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPacific Urethanes has developed an Emergency Reporting Program that has been coordinated with the City of Ontario Fire Department. The Emergency Reporting Program details roles and responsibilities, procedures, and corrective measures to be used in the event of an emergency that could threaten human health or the environment. \n\nEmployees have been trained and are fa"
