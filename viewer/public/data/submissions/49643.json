Chlorination processes include liquid chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe chlorination process accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine release. The first worst case scenario, defined by the EPA, states the owner or operator will assume that the\u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00bf is released as a gas more than ten (10) minutes. The alternative scenario is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario The Amerson Water Treatment Facility has no accident history, since it is a new facility. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decrease to a theoretical \u00bftoxic endpoint. This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects. The residential population within a perimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined to estimate the population potentially affected.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Amerson Water Treatment Facility Risk Management Program includes"
