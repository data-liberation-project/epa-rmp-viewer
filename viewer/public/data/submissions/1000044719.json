Holton Water Purification Works.  The Purification Plant exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program threshold quantity of 2500 pounds for chlorine.  The facility is located at 61 North Road in Hope, Rhode Island.  The facility is not subject to OSHA requirements and falls under Prevention Program 2.  \r\n\r\nThe original treatment plant was placed online in 1926.  The plant is capable of treating 144 mgd using liquid ferric sulfate as coagulant, lime for corrosion control, sodium silicofluoride for preventing dental caries and chlorine for disinfection.  The purification plant building consists of an administration area, the filter wing and the chemical and control wing.  The chemical and control wing and filter gallery have a combined area of 33,600 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe chemical storage in the chemical and control wing consists of bulk storage of 60 tons of quicklime and ferric sulfate, 7 tons of sodium silicofluoride, and 12 one-ton containers of liquid chlorine under pressure; only three of the chlorine containers are tied into the chlorination process at any one time.  \r\n\r\nIn the chlorine storage and feeder rooms there is a vacuum operated system with chlorine gas alarms and an automatic ventilation system; in addition, there are three chlorinators in the feed room beneath the storage room.  There are two scales with separate header manifolds with three one-ton cylinders on each scale and up to six full cylinders in storage.  There is a maximum inventory on site of 24,000 pounds. Chlorine detectors are located in the chlorine storage room and in the chlorine feed room located on the floor directly beneath the chlorine storage room.  Chlorine alarms are located at the central control board.   \r\n\r\nWorst"

      "SummaryText": "Case Release Scenario\r\nDuring peak demand, a maximum of three one-ton cylinders may be online per scale and would account for the maximum worst case release of 6,000 pounds.  The worst case release scenario is based on a chlorine gas leak from a broken header in the chlorine storage room.  With a release rate of 600 lbs/minute for 10 minutes in an urban setting the toxic endpoint is a radius of 2.3 miles.  Those affected by a chlorine release would include a population of 5,247.  Public and environmental receptors within the affected areas include schools, library, police/fire department, an elementary school, an early childhood center, commercial/industrial areas, treatment plant staff, recreational areas and the Scituate Reservoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical Prevention Steps\r\nUnder Prevention Program 2 the facility completes several review processes.  Examples include safety review, hazard review, operating procedure review etc.  Staff at the plant must complete specific training classes including multiple levels of HAZWOPER, ICS and OSHA Training.  Process controls include vents, manual and automatic shutoffs, alarms, pressure readings, enclosures, emergency shutdown systems and the use of a gas feed system.  Ammonium hydroxide is used to test for leaks of the chlorine cylinders and valves.  Entrance into the chlorine storage room is limited to employees with electronic badge access.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the past 5 years at the Providence Water Treatment Plant that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe Providence Water Supply Board has a written and approved Emergency Response Plan that was last revised on October 31, 2007, with an update scheduled for mid July 2014.  The plan includes specific actions that need to be taken in the event of an e"
