April 2004 changes to RMP data elements are included in this update. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) RMP and PSM Guidelines have been implemented at this facility. This facility prepares agricultural crops for processing consistent with SIC Code 0723.\n\nThere are 2 Ammonia Refrigeration facilities at this site. The existing or Facility #1 was completed in 1988. A new storage facility and independent NH3 refrigeration system was completed in June 2000 located 500? south of the existing cold storage. Since they are totally separate facilities with no interconnection of refrigeration systems they are treated as separate processes. Facility #1 is a larger system with NH3 operating capacity of 25,287 lbs.. Facility #2 has a capacity of 12,900 lbs.. Facility #1 is used for the Worst Case scenario and the Alternate release scenario typical of a compressor shaft seal failure would apply to either system.\n\nA conversion of storage room 2 into a pre-cooler in 2003 added additional refrigeration equipment and NH3 inventory. Equipment added included 1-compressor, 1-evaporative condenser, 1-HPR, 2-pre-cooler coils and miscellaneous associated piping. This Hazard Analysis revision accounts for the associated changes. \n\nRevisions to the original hazard analysis were required since changes to the High Pressure Receiver capacity made it possible to contain all of the NH3 in the high pressure receivers during the off season. Previously management controls and physical storage limitations prevented filling the HPR with the total charge. Worst Case distance to toxic endpoints decreased, even with increased inventory, since mitigation factors for release in an enclosed space and urban designation due to the adjacent orchards were both considered. Population estimates are using 2000 Census data. \n\n\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions "

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at HMC Cold Storage are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Packing and storage of fresh produce.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for Refrigeration.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), have been eliminated from this Executive summary as directed in April 2004 changes.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nHMC Cold Storage maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What I"

All possible conditions that could upset the system and natural disasters like fire and earthquake.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, HMC Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHMC Cold Storage has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHMC Cold Storage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

The most recent review was performed on 05/25/2000.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nHMC Cold Storage conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 03/03/2003.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nHMC Cold Storage promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nHMC Cold Storage truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
