We at the Baxter Water Treatment Plant (Baxter WTP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water for human consumption.  Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the public safe, disinfected drinking water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Baxter WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Baxter WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from rail cars. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Baxter WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site peopl"

      "SummaryText": "e. To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring. The Baxter WTP chlorine facility is equipped with a chlorine emergency scrubber system designed to contain and neutralize accidental releases and safeguard plant employees and as well as the general public.  \r\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\r\nThe Baxter WTP, operating since 1959, is located at 9001 State Road in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between the Delaware River and State Road in the northeastern section of Philadelphia.  Surface water taken from the Delaware River is treated and disinfected at the Baxter WTP to EPA standards and sent to the public for human consumption. This water treatment process includes preliminary screening, coagulation and sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination before final distribution to the public. The Baxter WTP produces up to 282 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water, with an average flow of between 165 to 175 MGD.\r\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP.  The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations. \r\nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via rail lines that enter the property. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously checks for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control building. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressure and allow for quicker liquefaction to occur.  A"

Both buildings are equipped with an automatic operated ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects 5 ppm of chlorine in the room. Room air is vented to a scrubber that neutralizes the gases.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The main control building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \r\nThe Baxter WTP is controlled at State Road by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  Visitors and contractors must check-in at the administration building and be approved by Baxter WTP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \r\nFive-year Accident History Summary\r\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Baxter WTP during the last five years. Some minor, incidental releases may have occurred over this period, but they were quickly handled by staff, were neutralized by the existing scrubber, or posed no safety or health hazards. \r\nThere was a single release on-site during the past 5-years that affected a single employee in the 90-ton railcar area at the plant near a packing gland.  The employee affected received minor medical treatment and returned to work the next day.  There was no other damage resulting from this small incidental release. \r\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \r\nBaxter WTP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the What-If scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any found significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff has traced and resolved items on this list.  In 2004, the HA was reviewed and found to be applicable since there have been no major process changes.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nBaxter WTP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. Baxter WTP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid and correct deviations.

In fact, Baxter WTP helps their employees understand, through training, the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine on site, and to increase their employees awareness with respect to their hazards. Baxter WTP's training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers 1) a general overview of the processes, 2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and 3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed. \r\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required, and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training.  \r\nMaintenance Program\r\nBaxter WTP maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Baxter WTP believes that this program is the primary line of defense against a release, and addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. Baxter WTP's maintenance program includes the following:\r\n* Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes, and prior operating experience\r\n* Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals\r\n* Training of maintenance personnel in procedures for safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, line or equipment opening, and avoidance and correction of unsafe conditions\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every three ye"

Baxter WTP and PWD assembled an audit team in December 2002 that included personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process, and this team evaluated whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit were documented, recommendations have been implemented and tracked, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nBaxter WTP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  Baxter WTP trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff, added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures, and passed on to the training unit for their inclusion in existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event.\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\nBaxter WTP has established a written emergency response program that is followed by the employees to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  This program has been coordinated with the City of Philadelphia Fire Department HAZMAT Unit, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted every 12 months; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed"

      "SummaryText": "at that time.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nA few minor changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified for the chlorine process in 1998 during the hazard review process.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and many have been implemented.  In addition, many of the recommendations from the compliance audit have been implemented. The implementation of these sets of recommendations further improves the safety of the covered processes. \r\nAt present construction is underway at the Baxter WTP to convert chlorine facilities to feed sodium hypochlorite.  The new 200,000 gallon hypochlorite storage and feed system is scheduled for completion by March 1, 2005.\r\nBAXTER WTP\t\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\tRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAXTER_RMP_EXECSUMMARY 2004.DOC\tES-6\r\n\r\nBAXTER_RMP_EXECSUMMARY 2004.DOC\tES-1"
