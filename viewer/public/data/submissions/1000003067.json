If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local volunteer fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.    Facility Information.  \nA?    The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for sale to farmer customers\nA?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\nA?    The maximum quantity stored would be 120,000  pounds.  Stored in two 12,000-gallon storage tanks and one 15,000 gallon storage tank..\nA?    \n\n3.    The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\na)    The Worst-Case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 70098 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank (15,000 gallons) at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.5 miles.\n\nb)    The Alternative Release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .43 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of A?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1A? published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, A?storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.A?\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\na)    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant prop"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
