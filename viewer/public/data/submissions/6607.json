Safety information is reviewed periodically, no less than annually. The Company employs a Full-time Safety Coordinator ; the Coordinator oversees training, safety, and conducts periodic site and equipment audits. Site Inspections are also carried out by the local fire department, and our loss control provider periodically inspects the site for compliance and safety.\n2. The major hazards identified with the process include toxic release, stress corrosion , overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, alarms and procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n3. Mitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia.\n4. Employees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as periodic refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation. \n5. Maintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date,  or if a system or process is changed or upgraded. OSHA 1910.111 standards are used to identify those needs. The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation). In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.",

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia  which is considered hazardous by EPA. We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facilities.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program for anhydrous ammonia is based on the ANSI K-61.1 standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\", and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated response actions with the Battleground Fire Department, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training, and has verified that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and,  has  instructed employees on  procedures for notification of the local fire authority (Battleground Fire Department) and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. \n\n2.
