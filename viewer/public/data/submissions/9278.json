Exxon, operator of BRPP, has a long-standing dedication to safety and environmental stewardship as the corporation's primary goal. Safety and protection of the environment are an integral part of Exxon's operations and corporate culture.  \n\nBRPP's dedication to safety is demonstrated in many ways.  To help ensure the safety of BRPP operations, BRPP invests significant resources in accident prevention. Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and other operations facilities.  BRPP's policies and our dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help prevent releases of hazardous substances.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with our Emergency Response Plan.  \n\nExxon modified its safety programs in 1991 by adopting a structured safety management systems entitled, \"Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS)\".  BRPP utilizes a formal program of operations integrity along with the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible Care initiative to assure proper design, operation, maintenance, inspection, work permits, change management, and emergency response in a proactive effort to minimize risk to the public, environment, and the plant.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program "

BRPP is a low density, high-pressure polyethylene (LDPE) manufacturing facility.  \n\nIn accordance with the EPA's new Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120, BRPP was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were on the plant site in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity defined by the regulations.  The largest quantity is evaluated because the regulations guide the operator to consider the largest quantity of the substance in a process or operation if a listed substance is used or located in different processes or operations on a plant site.  The term \"threshold quantity\" is simply the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated under these new regulations.  Based on process knowledge, Exxon identified the regulated substances involved in the operation and determined the quantities of each regulated substance on the site.\n\nBRPP uses six regulated substances above the threshold quantity in 14 separate processes.  These substances are acetaldehyde, n-butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propylene, and vinyl acetate.\n\nDETERMINATION OF PROGRAM LEVEL FOR THE SITE\n\nThe new regulations under which this document was prepared (i.e., 40 CFR Part 68) require the operator to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" which the EPA has defined as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure\"  Based on this required evaluation of a hypothetical and extremely unlikely scenario, the distances to endpoints (i.e., an overpressure of 1 psi) excee"

BRPP is also subject to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  Accordingly, BRPP is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe ARP Program requires one worst-case scenario for all listed toxic substances.  As required by the ARP Program regulations, the worst case release scenario was used to evaluate such a scenario involving the toxic regulated substance that is on site in a quantity above the threshold quantity (vinyl acetate).  The ERPG-2 for vinyl acetate (0.26 mg/l) was used to determine the distance to endpoint in the event of a release.  The hypothetical scenario involving the release of vinyl acetate was found to have a distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe ARP Program requires the assumption of an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion, regardless of whether such a scenario is realistic.  According to EPA regulations, the endpoint for the \"worst-case release\" of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure, which would result from such a worst-case release scenario.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in this scenario shall be used to determine the distance to the endpoint.  Passive mitigation systems are not applicable to the \"worst case release scenario\" because, according to the regulations, this scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud.\n\nAs required by the ARP Program regulations, the regulatory definition of the \"worst case release scenario\" was used to evaluate such a scenario for those regulated substances that are on site in quantities above their appropriate threshold b"

These distances were calculated using the EPA equations.  The hypothetical scenario that involves the butane was found to be the one with the longest distance to the endpoint, with a 0.54-mile distance to the endpoint.  Accordingly, under the regulations, this scenario involving butane is defined as the \"worst-case release scenario\" for the facility. \n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" was evaluated for each flammable substance in accordance with government regulations to identify the scenario with the longest distance to the endpoint, without regard to how unlikely the scenarios are and without consideration of the multiple redundant safety systems and safety programs that are in place to prevent releases and incidents.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nIn addition to requiring operators to evaluate the above-described \"worst-case release scenarios,\" the new ARP Program regulations require operators to evaluate other hypothetical release scenarios that involve smaller releases.  These hypothetical scenarios are termed \"alternative release scenarios.\"  Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems is allowed for alternative release scenarios.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative-case release scenario for each toxic substance that will reach an endpoint off-site is required under the ARP Program.  The alternative-case release scenario for vinyl acetate is a pump failure on TK-932, resulting in the deinventory of 11,000 pounds of vinyl acetate into the pump diked area.  The evaluation is based upon the assumption that the pump containment area is completely filled with vinyl acetate.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is 0.07 miles which is within the plant boundary.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe new ARP regulations require the operator to model a single \"alternative release scenario\" for all regulated flammable subs"

It was determined that there are no alternative-case release scenarios capable of producing a 1 psi overpressure beyond the fenceline.  The alternate case scenario for flammable substances at BRPP is a VCE resulting from a reactor and recycle piping system failure releasing 4,400 pounds of ethylene.  The maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure for this event is 0.10 miles.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a general overview of the main elements of the Accident Prevention Program that is currently in operation at BRPP.  BRPP has aligned and integrated its safety management programs at a high level with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Program regulations for consistency and effectiveness. Because processes at BRPP that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  In addition, Exxon Corporation has implemented OIMS at each of its operations worldwide that include the aspects of EPA's prevention program.  OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAll employees at BRPP are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.

In addition, BRPP has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBRPP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address written data and engineering drawings on the design of the facility, the chemistry of the process and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments, sections or groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any of the process safety information.\n\nSafety data is maintained for all chemicals that are used, handled, or produced at the facility.  This data includes permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity and corrosive information, thermal and chemical stability, toxicity data (if applicable), personal protective equipment, and measures to be taken in the event of physical contact or airborne exposure to a chemical.  This information is maintained in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), as part of OSHA's Hazard Communication Program at the plant.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented the safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, etc.).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trai"

This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBRPP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  This is a systematic procedure in which each process is systematically examined to identify all of the potential hazards, and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nBRPP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate.\n\nThe PHA team findings and suggestions are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative priority ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking process is intended to ensure that potential hazards that are considered to have the highest priority receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented are tracked unti"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBRPP maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent training of new operators, and they provide good reference materials for experienced operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, BRPP maintains CAPS (Compentency Analysis Profile System) Documentation which contains sections that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nBRPP employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.

This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nBRPP uses contractors to perform project-specific activities and to supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that these contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, BRPP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Safety personnel periodically monitor contractor safety performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nBRPP conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBRPP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment, including pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems, in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and  (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nBRPP developed safe work practices designed to ensure worker and process safety and these safe work practices are followed regularly to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  Examples of safe work practices include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel in the process areas (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for the safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work permit), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. \n\nThese safe work practices and procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely at all times.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nBRPP has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any changes to processes.

A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBRPP promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and underlying cause(s) of the incident to develop corrective actions and implement steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident and prevent similar incidents.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent similar incidents, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are fully complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, BRPP periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented properly, to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and to develop ideas for improving the program.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all covered processes at the plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release in the unlikely event of an accidental release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon gas detectors with alarms and infrared sensor with alarms.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare system to contain and incinerate releases\n2. Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure or temperature)\n5. Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\n6. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n7. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n8. Atmospheric relief devices.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to any accidental releases, as well as procedures for responding to any fires that could occur in the unlikely event of a release of a flammable substance.  These response procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and for accounting for all personnel (employees, contractors, and visitors) after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training to enable them to fulfill their role in an emergency.  The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to processes.
