This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, the Emergency Action Plan will be initiated and gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Elk Basin Operation Center Gas Plant, located 16 miles north of Powell, Wyoming, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas. The Elk Basin Operations Center Gas Plant has two regulated flammable, butane and propane.  In addition, the Elk Basin Gas Plant uses and/or processes the gas from the Elk Basin field that contains hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is also regulated substance.  The amount hydrogen sulfide in the entire plant is less than the threshold quantity.\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in Program Level 1 at the gas plant was not calculated due to low amount of Hydrogen Sulfide (1,133 lbs.) contained in the entire gas plant operation.    \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) is not required for Program Level 1 facilities. \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane.  The maximum inventory in a single tank is 170,966 pounds; therefore, the inventory is as"

The maximum inventory in a single tank is 149,000 pounds, the inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 mile.   Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  The population within the VCE for both butane and propane, was estimated utilizing the Estimate Population Around Current Map Pointer option in LandView III program.  The program estimates the population within the .4 mile radius of exposure for the Worse Case Scenario at two people.  However, a tour of the facility will prove that no residents are located within .4 of a mile.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and initiating Management of Change to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the PSM program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant.   \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Elk Basin Operations Center Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) on the Pipe & Instrument Diagrams (P&ID) along with the Normal Operating Conditions, (NOC).  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Elk Basin Operations Center Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with other methods to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Elk Basin Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \n\nIn addition, the Elk Basin Gas Plant maintains a Trouble Shooting Procedure that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n Training\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Elk Basin Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Elk Basin Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Elk Basin Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Elk Basin Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.
