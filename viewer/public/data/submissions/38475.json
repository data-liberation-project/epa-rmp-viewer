The RMP covers the following facilities which are under common control by SNF Holding Company (SNF):  Chemtall Incorporated, and Flocryl, Inc.\n\nAs part of complying with the Risk Management Program Rule, SNF has reviewed and enhanced previously existing accidental release procedures and emergency response policies. These policies include:\n\n*Emergency Response Program\n*Emergency Action Plan\n*Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan\n*Process Safety Management Plan\n*Hurricane and Tropical Storm Plan\n*First Responder Team\n*Hazard Communication Plan\n*Hazardous Waste Management Plan\n*Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan\n*Safe Work Practices\n*Hazmat/Hazwoper Team\n\nThere are five substances at the SNF facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  These substances are used in various processes throughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  These substances and the specific processes covered include:\n\n*Toxic Substances:\n\n--Methyl chloride: This material is used in the chloromethylation (CM) plant at Chemtall. The CM Plant uses methyl chloride as a reactant to produce quaternized monomers that are subsequently used in other facility processes to produce water treatment chemicals. The CM plant products are also sold to off-site customers.  The maximum quantity of methyl chloride stored on-site is 580,000 pounds.\n\n--Ammonium hydroxide: Ammonium hydroxide is received and stored at the facility as a 30 percent aqueous solution.  Ammonium hydroxide is used in Chemtall's emulsion plant processes for batch neutralization to produce emulsion polymers. The maximum amount of 30 percent ammonium hydroxide stored on-site is 190,000 pounds (56,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) ammonia)\n\n--Formaldehyde: Formaldehyde is used as a reactant in Chemtall's Mannich process. Formaldehyde is "

The maximum amount of 50 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 100,000 pounds (51,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) formaldehyde)\n\n--Acrylonitrile: Acrylonitrile is used as a reactant in Flocryl's acrylamide process. The maximum amount of acrylamide stored on-site is 1,700,000 pounds.\n\n*Flammable Substances:\n\n--Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine (DMA) is also used in Chemtall?s Mannich process as a reactant. Dimethylamine is received and used as a 60 percent solution in water.  The maximum amount of 60 percent dimethylamine stored on-site is approximately 400,000 pounds (240,000 pounds pure (100 percent basis) dimethylamine)\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed. \n\nAcrylamide Process (Acrylonitrile): The Acrylamide Process prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n*Vents\n*Relief valves\n*Check valves\n*Manual shutoffs\n*Automatic shutoffs\n*Interlocks\n*Alarms and procedures\n*Grounding equipment\n*Dikes\n*Detectors\n*Water cannons\n*Scrubbers\n*Emergency air supply\n*Rupture disks\n*Sprinkler system\n*Deluge system\n\nEmulsion Process (Ammonium Hydroxide): The Emulsion Process prevention programs include the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n*Vents\n*Relief valves\n*Check valves\n*Scrubbers\n*Manual shutoffs\n*Automatic shutoffs\n*Interlocks\n*Alarms and procedures\n*Dikes\n\nMannich/NMA Process (Formaldehyde and Dimethylamine): The Mannich/NMA Process prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n*Vents\n*Check valves\n*Scrubbers\n*Manual shutoffs\n*Automatic shutoffs\n*Interlocks\n*Alarms and procedures\n*Grounding equipment\n*Dikes\n*Relief valves\n*Rupture disks\n*Purge system\n*Water cannons\n*Process area detectors\n\nChloromethylation Process (Methyl chloride): The Chloromethylation Process prevention program includes the following process c"

The ERP has historically been coordinated with the Liberty County Sheriff's and Fire Department, Liberty Memorial Medical Center, Liberty-Hinesville Emergency Management Agency, Life Star Rescue Helicopter, and Memorial Medical Center in Savannah, and will continue to be coordinated in this manner.  As part of the community involvement efforts, the following activities are coordinated with the departments and agencies listed above:\n\n*Pre-emergency tours\n*Emergency action drills\n*Community evacuation procedures\n*Material safety data sheets\n*Responsibility roles in evacuation procedures\n\nAlso, the facility has a supervised alarm system with United Alarms.
