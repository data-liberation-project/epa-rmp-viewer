              "Description": "The prevention program for this location is a Level 2.  This facility has no processes which requires the removal or opening of valves of the chlorine cylinders.  These cylinders are received by truck shipment, and are received filled by the facility's supplier.\n\nThe employees at this location, upon truck arrival, visually inspect the cylinders prior to off-loading.  Cylinders are inspected for their bonnets (no cylinder is off-loaded without the bonnet) to ensure that the integrity of the cylinders' valves have not been compromised.  The cylinders are also inspected to unsure that they are still properly strapped and anchored on the truck prior to off-loading to ensure that the cylinders have not shifted or been damaged during shipment.  Along with the visual inspection, an olfactory inspection is also conducted.  This \"smell\" test is to ensure that there are no leaking cylinders.\n\nWhen cylinders have passed the visual and \"smell\" test, they are unstrapped, and off-loaded.  Cylinders are off-loaded two-at-a-time by use of a dolley.  An approved dockboard is used for the transfer of the cylinders off of the truck and into the storage area.  This dockboard has anti-slip devices, and can withstand the load that is imposed upon the dockboard by the dolley, cylinders, and employee.  Once the cylinders are moved into the interior storage area, they are carefully removed from the dolley.  Cylinders are only off-loaded by two employees; one employee moves the dolley into the storage area, while the other employee removes cylinder and places cylinder into storage location (this is completed while the first employee steadies the dolley).\n\nThe cylinders are stored in a specified and properly identified area in the warehouse.  The area is specified for this storage by substantial ventilation, which also helps keep the cylinders cool, and the location is also a flat poured concrete surface for structural stability when storing cylinders.  This location is in the back of the warehouse by the bay door, so if there is a release, the cylinders are easily accessible for a response.  This location is well marked and identified with hazard information posted above the cylinder storage area, with information regarding safe handling practices, and general information regarding emergencies.\n\nAll employees involved with the off-loading and shipping of the chlorine cylinders are Commercial Driver Licensed Hazmat drivers.  This training is a part of the prevention program because it familiarizes employees with chlorine hazards, and safe handling and storage procedures.  Training is completed every time the employee renews their CLD License.",

Ovferall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposeures, reducing the threat to our own personnal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and  regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we receive, handle and store the chlorine cylinders, alon with the training provided to our employees.  The primary purpose of this facility is reveive and distribute chemicals (chlorine) to local customers.  The largest,and only,  size container of chlorine is a 150 pound cylinder.\n\nOur employees conduct proper cylinder handling, receiving, storage and shipping of the chlorine cylinders.  The prevention program for this facility is based solely on the handling and storage of the cylinders.  There is no maintenance conducted on the cylinders, other than visual and smell inspection conducted when cylinders are received at this location.  Active mitigation is considered for this facility to prevent chlorine releases.  The sprinkler system will help prevent the overpressurization, and /or fusible plug (liquid release) failure of the cylinders.  If a fire occurs, the spriknler system will act as a cooling agent to prevent these occurances from happening.  The cylinders are filled by Harcros Chemicals, Inc.,  All valve and cylinder maintenance is conducted by Harcross Chemcials, Inc. to prevent releases during shippment, sotrage, etc.\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan is in the developmental stage.  The written procedures are completed, and HazMat training for employees has been scheduled to be completed in Octo"

      "SummaryText": "ber of this year.  Currently, this facility utilizes trained personnel from Harcros Chemical to respond and mitigate a chlorine release from this facility.  The persons who are trained in 40 Hour HazMat Response are Curtis Thomas, and Jim Gruber.  If a release occurs, this facility will evacuate the building after notifying Harcros Hazmat Personnel, and notifying the Pulaski County 911 system for call-out to affected responding agencies.  Mitigation measures would be a cylinder repair, or neutralization of a liquid release (if it ever occured) by use of caustic soda, or lime stored on-site.  If mitigation measures do not stop the release, evacuation of surrounding population will commence.\n\nThe worst case scenario for this facility is the failure of the largest chlorine cylinder, which would be a 150 pound release.  The distance to endpoint was calculated using RMP Comp.  The area surrounding this facility is considered to be urban due to hills, and surrounding buildings, as well as indoor storage of chlorine.  Passive mitigation was considered for this scenario which consisted of enclosure with direct contact with outside air.  The distance to endpoint for this release scenario is 1.2 miles.  This release could impact approximately 15 persons.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was determined for this location.  However, based on the type of storage, and the handling procedures used, this type of release would almost be impossible.  The release would consist of a packing nut failure around the valve.  This release would be a small release around the valve resulting in approximately 5 pounds of chlorine gas released into the atmosphere.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of 0.08 miles around this facility.  Again passive mitigation was considered for this scenario consiting of enclosure with direct contact with outside air.  This release would affect a population of approximately 1 persons.  All population information was based upon Landview Software.\n\nTher"
