      "SummaryText": "Magic Waters Waterpark is a public water park owned and operated by the Rockford Park District, a municipality.  Chlorine is stored on site and used to provide clean, safe water to the wave pool for park patrons.\n\nOn August 10, 2001 there was an incident where a minor amount of chlorine mixed with air was injected into the wave pool.  This incident was caused by an unnaturally low water level in the wave pool's surge tank.  The low water level allowed air into the recirculation pump, where the chlorine mixed with air was injected into the water. As per our Emergency Response Plan, emergency response personnel were immediately summoned. A total of 45 people were transported via ambulance to local hospitals.  All were treated for what was assumed to be chlorine gas exposure and released the same day.  \n\nMagic Waters Waterpark immediately added additional personnel checks and hired a qualified expert to thoroughly inspect the mechanical systems in the wave room.  That same month addition equipment was installed in the surge tank to ensure the low water level would not reoccur.  Magic Waters also installed an interlocking monitoring system that provides interruption of chlorine feed in accordance with Illinois Department of Public Health Code. \n\nEmergency response procedures are reviewed every year before the operating season begins.  Magic Waters Waterpark also conducts mock evacuation drills each year to ensure that park personnel can adequately protect its patrons in case of emergency situations, whether they be related to chlorine, designed to protect the public from contaiminated water, or natural hazards such as severe weather.  \n\nMagic Waters has always had an active Safety Program, since patron and community safety are of utmost importance. The facility has an on-site emergency medical staff on duty whenever the park is open to patrons.  The facility also has on-site security during operating hours who work hand-in-hand with local emergency responders in the eve"
