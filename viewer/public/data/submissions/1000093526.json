      "SummaryText": "1.1    Accidental Release Prevention\n\nBoskovich Farms has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. Boskovich Farms policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Boskovich Farms facility is listed as 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California 93030.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  For documenting purposes, the facility will report the \"maximum intended inventory\" as 27,870 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia. Refer to Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\n\n\n\n1.3    Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nIn accordance with CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook (Compliance Workbook).\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled in accordance with applicable regulations.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Boskovich Farms has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, "

      "SummaryText": "it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?    Well-designed Relief System\n\n?    Alarms and Shutoffs\n\n?    Gas Detection\n\n?    Adequate Venting System\n\n\n\n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Boskovich Farms to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 27,870 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis [PHA]\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Hot Work Permit\n\n?    Contractors\n\n\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR ?2750.9, the owner or operator shall submit the data required under ?2745.5, ?2745.6, and ?2745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under ?2745.10, whichever is earlier.  19 CCR ?2750.9 states: The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidenta"

This facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the LA County Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In accordance with 19 CCR ?2765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place.  However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  These mechanisms are described below.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has submitted a Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS).  In addition, the Business Emergency Plan (BEP) has been filed with the local Fire Department.  The HMI and BEP are located with the Plant Manager. The facility has procedures in-place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for a response.  A current copy of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) can be found with the Plant Manager, and within the Emergency Planning and Response tab of the Compliance Workbook.  The EAP includes:\n\n?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n\n?    Evacuation Procedures\n\n?    Safety and Health Considerations\n\n?    Notification Procedures\n\n\n\n1.7    External Events Analysis Information\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:\n\n?
