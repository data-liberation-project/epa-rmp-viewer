              "Description": "Introduction\n\n\n\nThe Boskovich fourteen (14) step Process Safety Management (PSM) program provides information and procedures to prevent or minimize an accidental release of ammonia.  This program attempts to anticipate future problems by identifying, evaluating, and preventing failures of the processes that could result in a release of this chemical.  Every element of the PSM program applies to all units in the process.\n\n\n\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. owns and operates a refrigeration facility to cold treat and store produce (fresh vegetables) and manufacture ice. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration systems. Since the 2016 submittal, the Aqua Ammonia Absorption Refrigeration Plant (AAARP) was removed from service. The storage vessel is still located on-site, but has been decommissioned from use. The facility is in operation seven days per week, 24 hours per day.  Watchmen are present at all times. The ammonia refrigeration facility consists of the interconnected units listed below to determine maximum inventory.\n\n\n\nList of Refrigeration Units\n\n     Facility                  Ammonia Inventory (lb)\n\nEast Freezer                    3,000\n\nWest Freezer/Pressure Cooler    2,820\n\nPressure Cooler                    3,440\n\nIce Plant #1                    1,725\n\nIce Plant #2                    1,725\n\nHydrocooler                    2,125\n\nHydrovac#l                    890\n\nHydrovac #2                    1,645\n\nBuilding Piping                    10,500\n\nTotal                            27,870\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration units listed above are considered a single process. For dispersion modeling, a complete rupture of the interconnected building piping was used for the worst-case release scenario. \n\n\n\nProcess\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used strictly as a refrigerant at the Boskovich site.  There are no chemical reactions that occur in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system.  Ammonia is used only as a heat transfer medium.  The ammonia liquid from the refrigeration system(s) is vaporized as it absorbs heat from the process, in this case produce cooling.  Ammonia vapor is returned to the refrigeration(s) system where it is compressed, cooled and condensed back into the liquid phase.  It is then sent back to the process to repeat the cooling cycle.\n\n\n\nEmployee Involvement\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to involve employees at an elemental level of the PSM Plan. The purpose of employee participation is improved safety for all employees. PSM will not be effective without the involvement of the employees and/or their representatives.  Boskovich Farms, Inc. provides for employee participation in their process safety management plans by consulting with employees in developing the PSM program. \n\n\n\nAwareness\n\n\n\nEach new refrigeration employee is made aware of ammonia refrigeration PSM as a part of their initial orientation process, in conjunction with hazard communication required by 29 CFR 1910.1200. New refrigeration employees are given a document titled Hazards of Ammonia and a one page document entitled Process Safety Management.  The PSM document is a simple explanation of what the PSM program for ammonia refrigeration is all about.  It is reviewed with each new refrigeration employee and they acknowledge their awareness of PSM by signing the document.  If necessary, the PSM orientation is given in Spanish.  PSM awareness documents are available in both English and in Spanish.\n\n\n\nInvolvement\n\n\n\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. involves operations or maintenance employees in meetings or discussions concerning the PSM policies and procedures.  In addition, several other PSM procedures are reviewed by or conducted with the involvement of at least one employee or a representative of the employees:\n\n\n\nA?    Process Safety Information is reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness.\n\nA?    Operating Procedures are developed with input from refrigeration employees. In addition, refrigeration employees check the written procedures to ensure they are accurate.\n\nA?    Training programs and needs for refresher training are reviewed with affected employees. More experienced refrigeration employees participate in the training process by observing the demonstration of job tasks conducted by the less experienced employees.\n\nA?    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted with involvement of at least one refrigeration employee.\n\nA?    Mechanical Integrity Audits are conducted with the involvement of at least one refrigeration employee.\n\nA?    Refrigeration employees participate in the development of the mechanical integrity program and procedures.\n\nA?    All affected refrigeration employees are made aware of ammonia refrigeration process changes prior to commencement of work. \n\nA?    Incident Investigation reports are reviewed with all affected refrigeration employees. An employee may be asked to serve on the investigation team.\n\nA?    Emergency Planning and Response procedures are reviewed with affected employees.\n\n\n\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. also provides a means of allowing employees to voice concerns about process safety to management. To meet this provision, we have established a management system to address, resolve, follow-up and document employee concerns.  This management system includes provisions to:\n\n\n\nA?    Assure that the concerns are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nA?    Document the actions that are to be taken to resolve the concerns.\n\nA?    complete the actions as soon as possible; when necessary, interim measures are taken when the\n\nA?    Actions will require significant time to implement.\n\nA?    Develop a written schedule of when actions are to be completed.\n\nA?    Monitor the implementation of the actions and verify and document their completion.\n\nA?    communicate the actions to operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work\n\nA?    Assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\n\n\nAccess to Information\n\n\n\nRefrigeration employees, including contractor refrigeration employees, are provided access to the process hazard analyses (PHA) and any other information required by the PSM Standard.  They have access to all Process Safety Information, including:\n\n\n\nA?    piping and instrumentation drawings\n\nA?    equipment information\n\nA?    chemical information such as MSDS\n\nA?    technological information such as process chemistry\n\nA?    operating and maintenance procedures\n\n\n\nThe PSM RMP Coordinator is responsible for controlling access to PSM information. All affected employees are provided access to ammonia refrigeration PSM files and information at all times (not just during day shift) but access is available under the following limitations:\n\n\n\nA?    Approval must be given to remove any documents from the file.\n\nA?    Original copies of documents are not to be removed from the file area.\n\nA?    No markings are be made on original documents.\n\nA?    Previously unfiled documents are only added with proper authorization.\n\n\n\nAll employees directly involved with operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system are encouraged to periodically review the process safety information and most recent PHA. Such reviews are considered to be a training activity and can be conducted on company time.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe PSM Standard requires employers to perform a PHA for the covered ammonia refrigeration process. The purpose of performing a PHA is to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the process and to provide information to assist employers in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the chances of a catastrophic ammonia release. The PHA addressed the following:\n\nA?    The hazards of the process.\n\nA?    Previous incidents with likely potential for catastrophic consequences.\n\nA?    Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls.\n\nA?    Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships.\n\nA?    Facility siting.\n\nA?    Human factors.\n\nA?    A qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on employees in the workplace.\n\n\n\nThe PHA was performed by teams with expertise in engineering and process operations, knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used, and included employees with experience and knowledge specific to the processes being evaluated.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe intent of these procedures is to provide clear instructions for conducting activities involved in handling ammonia that are consistent with the process safety information. The operating procedures address steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to help employees understand the nature and causes of problems arising from ammonia operations, and increase employee awareness with respect to their hazards. An effective training procedure significantly reduces the number and severity of incidents arising from process operations, and can be instrumental in preventing small problems from leading to a catastrophic release. The training procedures include: Initial Training, Refresher Training, and Documentation.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to establish a screening process so that contractors, hired and used, accomplish the desired job tasks involving ammonia without compromising the safety and health of employees at a facility. The contractor must assure that contract employees are trained on performing the job safely, on the hazards related to the job, and on applicable provisions of the emergency action plan.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to make sure that, for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification necessitates a change to process safety information, important considerations are addressed before ammonia introduced into the process; namely, the pre-startup safety review must confirm the following: construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; for new facilities, a PHA has been performed and recommendations resolved or implemented; modified facilities meet the requirements of paragraph (1), \"Management of Change\"; and training of each employee involved in the process has been completed.\n\n\n\nNew Facilities or Systems\n\n\n\nBecause a process hazard analysis must be performed before the startup of a new facility or system, all required process safety information will be compiled and readily available. This includes information concerning the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.  The process hazard analysis shall be in full compliance with the requirements of 1910.119, paragraph (e). All recommendations from the process hazard analysis must be either resolved or implemented prior to startup, and properly documented. \n\n\n\nDocumentation will be established to verify completion of this activity. Boskovich will ensure that:\n\n\n\nA?    All safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are written, implemented, and are adequate. Recognized standards or codes, manufacturers' instructions, and other applicable regulations, may be considered in drafting procedures. \n\nA?    Construction and equipment is in accordance with the design specifications. The construction codes and standards used must be documented in the process safety information.\n\nA?    Training for each employee involved in operating the process has been completed. The modifications or additions reflected in the PSSR may create a need for additional training in other areas such as maintenance, emergency response or HAZCOM.  \n\nA?    Changes or revisions in the process safety information, the PHA and operating procedures like all other required PSM documents must be available to employees.\n\n\n\nModified Facilities or Systems\n\n\n\nAll process safety information must be updated. Boskovich will ensure that:\n\n\n\nA?    The requirements for a Management of Change have been completed. The Management of Change shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of 1910.119, Paragraph (l). \n\nA?    The relevant safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate. All procedures shall follow, where applicable, recognized standards or codes, manufacturersA? instructions, and other applicable regulations. \n\nA?    Construction and equipment is in accordance with the design specifications. \n\nA?    Training for each employee involved in operating the new equipment in the process has been completed. The modifications reflected in the PSSR may create a need for additional training in other areas such as maintenance, emergency or HAZCOM. Training for employees operating a process that has been modified will include reviewing any changes to relevant procedures. \n\nA?    Startup of new equipment is conducted in accordance with applicable industry standards, manufacturersA? recommendations, and plant procedures.\n\n\n\nVerification Forms\n\n\n\nA Pre-Startup Safety Review Verification form will be used to sign off acceptance of the pre-startup safety Review.  The form must be signed by the Operations Manager and the Refrigeration Engineer.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to assure that equipment used to process, store, or handle ammonia is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of ammonia releases. A mechanical integrity program is in place to assure the continued integrity of ammonia equipment.  A maintenance schedule was compiled to track and log the process.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to control, in a consistent manner, non-routine work conducted in ammonia process areas. Specifically, this subparagraph is concerned with the permitting of hot work operations in process areas.\n\n\n\nHot work permits for hot work operations, such as the ones associated with welding and cutting conducted on or near an ammonia process, will be in compliance with the fire prevention and protection requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to require management of all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions concerning ammonia other than \"replacement in kind,\" by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations\n\n\n\nAn incident investigation will be performed any time there is an incident which results in, or which could reasonably have resulted in (near-miss), a catastrophic release of ammonia. A catastrophic release can be defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving ammonia that presents serious danger to employees, including contract employees working on-site.\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of the criteria that will be used to determine whether an incident investigation should be performed. (Note: In the case of a near-miss, judgment must be made as to the potential results as opposed to the actual results.)\n\n\n\nA? Quantity of Ammonia Released \n\nA? Property Damage \n\nA? Fire or Explosion \n\nA? Injuries or Deaths \n\n\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\n\n\nThe intent of this procedure is to address actions employees are to take when there is and unwanted release of ammonia.  Boskovich Farms Inc. has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for this facility.  The plan is documented in Section 6 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nBoskovich Farms, Inc. has developed a compliance audit program to verify implementation of all PSM elements. The audits are conducted at least every three years. A Compliance Audit Checklist will be used to conduct and document the audit.  \n\n\n\nThe Refrigeration Engineer performs the audits on the ammonia facilities and verifies that the audit records are included in the PSM Files.  A written report of the audit findings is prepared.  Responses to the audit findings are promptly addressed and documented, and any deficiencies found during the audit promptly corrected.  Once the audit form is completed, the appropriate actions to address the recommendations are taken and documented.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "1.1    Accidental Release Prevention\n\nBoskovich Farms has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. Boskovich Farms policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\n1.2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Boskovich Farms facility is listed as 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California 93030.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  For documenting purposes, the facility will report the \"maximum intended inventory\" as 27,870 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia. Refer to Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\n\n\n\n1.3    Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nIn accordance with CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook (Compliance Workbook).\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled in accordance with applicable regulations.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Boskovich Farms has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, "

      "SummaryText": "it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?    Well-designed Relief System\n\n?    Alarms and Shutoffs\n\n?    Gas Detection\n\n?    Adequate Venting System\n\n\n\n1.4    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Boskovich Farms to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 27,870 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 requirements.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis [PHA]\n\n?    Operating Procedures\n\n?    Training\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity\n\n?    Management of Change\n\n?    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n?    Compliance Audits\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Hot Work Permit\n\n?    Contractors\n\n\n\n1.5    Five-Year Accident History\n\nFor any accidental release meeting the five-year accident history reporting criteria of 19 CCR ?2750.9, the owner or operator shall submit the data required under ?2745.5, ?2745.6, and ?2745.7 with respect to that accident within six months of the release or by the time the RMP is updated under ?2745.10, whichever is earlier.  19 CCR ?2750.9 states: The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident history all accidenta"

This facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the LA County Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In accordance with 19 CCR ?2765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place.  However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.  These mechanisms are described below.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has submitted a Hazardous Material Inventory (HMI) via California Environmental Reporting System (CERS).  In addition, the Business Emergency Plan (BEP) has been filed with the local Fire Department.  The HMI and BEP are located with the Plant Manager. The facility has procedures in-place to evacuate the facility and notify responders when there is a need for a response.  A current copy of the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) can be found with the Plant Manager, and within the Emergency Planning and Response tab of the Compliance Workbook.  The EAP includes:\n\n?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\n\n?    Evacuation Procedures\n\n?    Safety and Health Considerations\n\n?
