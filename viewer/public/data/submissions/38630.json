The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nDWQ operates and maintains the regional wastewater collection system outside the City of Sacramento, and also operates and maintains the chlorination process for numerous water wells and three water treatment plants owned by other County agencies.  Its wastewater collection facility, Arden Sewage Pumping Station (N19), is located at 1021 Howe Ave., Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, and uses chlorine for odor control in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located at the site of the former Arden Sewage Treatment Plant on the north bank of the American River adjacent to Cal Expo.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site on a regular ba"

The chlorine is used for odor control of wastewater.  Pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is withdrawn and reduced to vacuum by vacuum regulator valves mounted on each container's gas valve. The chlorine under vacuum is piped to chlorinators where it is metered and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through injectors.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of DWQ that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, DWQ has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation ofaccidental  releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by DWQ are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering controls; and emergency response programs.\n\nDWQ has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering its odor control process.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for DWQ's operations. The program and document mangement procedures inclu"

These include, among other things, installing vacuum regulator valves on the ton container valves.\n.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDWQ's Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, the local agency responsible for hazardous materials inventory reporting and release response coordination.  It consists of notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies. DWQ maintains First Responder capability with respect to chlorine releases at sites which it operates and maintains.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the process hazard analysis which DWQ committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.  Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation."
