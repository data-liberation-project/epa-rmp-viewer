If an emergency would occur, it is our policy to notify the Madera County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is operated by a farm management company engaged in citrus production.  On the ranch site is a 36,000 gallon propane tank facility which is used as a transfer station to bobtail trucks.  The bobtail trucks refuel 200+ windmachines powered by propane engines in the surrounding citrus orchards which are used for frost protection.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 135,000 pounds.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount\nallowed would release 135,000 pounds of propane. Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 85% at 60 F.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is offsite.\n\nAlternative Scenario. -  An alternative scenario may be a hose rupture caused by a pull-away.  A pull-away can occur is the driver fails to remove the hoses between the storage tank and the transfer vehicle before moving the vehicle.  In this scenario, the failure involves an 18 foot length of unloading hose, 3\" in diameter.  The active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose or 35 pounds.  The release leads to a vapor cloud explosion (endpoint 1 psi).  The release does not extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
