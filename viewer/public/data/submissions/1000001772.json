The Mallard Creek Polymers plant is an OSHA Star VPP Facility operating under OSHA Process Safety  Management (PSM) rules and regulations. The MCP site is also an ISO 9002/2000 registered business.\n\nThere have been no RQ releases in the past 5 years and no offsite impacts, onsite injuries nor property damage related to BD usage in the 30 year history at this facility. The plant conducts a PHA, Process Hazard Analysis every five years on the covered process or when changes occur or projects are implemented. Releases are prevented by sound engineering practices which include RAGAGEP, Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices, a rigorous computerized preventive maintenance and documented Mechanical Integrity program conducted by skilled, experienced and qualified personnel utilizing mandatory operating procedures. The OSHA Mechanical Integrity program includes detailed Vessel Integrity testing, frequent critical equipment checks and testing and complete system leak surveys to confirm and validate reliability. All equipment changes are formally reviewed and approved through a Management of Change process and before equipment is placed into service a formal pre-startup safety review is conducted by a qualified team. \n\nRoutine Inspections and audits of the plant safety programs are conducted both internally by the compliance and process engineering groups as well as external inspectors from the local Fire department hazardous materials group and Insurance company inspectors and OSHA. The plant also utilizes a formal documented Accident / Incident reporting system to include near misses. This process reviews all incidents to identify root cause issues for prevention and close-loop follow-up. \n\nThe plant is operated and manned on a 24 hour seven day schedule by formally trained \"Qualified Operators\".
