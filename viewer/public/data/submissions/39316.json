Accidental release prevention and Emergency Response policies.\n\nWe at Carter Lake Filter Plant are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Berthoud Fire District which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nWe have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  The substance is Chlorine.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 20,000 lbs.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA?s RMPComp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  \n\nToxic Worst-Case Analyses\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from North Plant Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The Release rate (lbs./min.) is calculated to be 200.  A distance to endpoint of 2.2 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of approximately 65 people within this distance.\n\nThe Worst Case scenario involves a catastrophic release from South Plant Chlorine room The scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.

The scenario involves the release of 32 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 120 minutes.  The Release rate (lbs./min.) is calculated to be 0.26 and a Distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of approximately 2.\n\nThe Alternative-Case scenario involves a release from South Plant Chlorine room.  The scenario involves the release of 0.52 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form.  Active mitigation controls such as sprinkler, scrubbers and emergency shut down are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The Release rate (lbs./min.) is calculated to be 0.26 and a Distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of approximately 2.\n\nFlammables Worst-Case Analyses\nNone applicable\n\nFlammables Alternative ?Case Analyses\nNone applicable\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 86 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCarter Lake Filter Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-If/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise i"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safety conducting activities within our covered processes, Carter Lake Filter Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCarter Lake Filter Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided periodically years and more frequently as needed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity \nCarter Lake Filter Plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\nCompliance Audits\nCarter Lake Filter Plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCarter Lake Filter Plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasona"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCarter Lake Filter Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n5.   Five-year Accident History.\n\nCarter Lake Filter Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan.\nFacility has its own written ER Plan.  The ER Plan includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The ER Plan includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies for responding to accidental release.  The ER Plan does include information on emergency health care.  \nDate of most recent review/update of ER Plan: 6/8/04\nDate of most recent ER training of employees: 6/8/04\nThe Local agency coordinating ER Plan is Berthoud Fire District which has the phone number 970-532-2264.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\nNo major developments or findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program."
