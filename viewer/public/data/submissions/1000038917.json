If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Cumberland Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency.  Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Cass County, Iowa LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowleded that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned,.  In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats, or other accident or acts of God which might occur on our premises.

Employees are annually trained to recognize hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine the comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."

In the unlikely event that the Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our location, the fire department with whom Cumberland has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Cass County LEPC.  Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human heaalth and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any external portion of the system which may"
