We operate our business in a manner that consciously safeguards our employees, customers and the community that we operate in.  In striving for responsible environmental, health & safety (EH&S) stewardship, AES pledges to:\n*  Diligently develop, construct and operate our facilities in an environmentally responsible manner that promotes pollution prevention and places the highest priority on health and safety.\n*  Operate facilities that meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local EH&S rules, regulations, ordinances and statues as well as recognized industry guidelines and standards.\n*  Continually measure, evaluate and improve our EH&S performance.\n*  Promote EH&S awareness that fosters a caring, ownership-driven culture among employees, contractors and vendors.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe AES Wolf Hollow (AES), power plant, located in Granbury, Texas, is a gas-fired combustion turbine power plant that produces electricity.  Steam is produced from turbine exhaust gasses and used to feed a power generator.  As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the gas-fired combustion turbine exhaust, aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams.  The aqueous ammonia is stored on-site in two storage tanks.  The storage capacity of each tank exceeds the threshold quantity for RMP applicability.  Aqueous ammonia is not on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OHSA) Process Safety Management list, therefore, the AES site is subject to RMP program 2 requirements.  There are no other toxic or flammable substances on-site that exceed RMP thresholds.\n\nManagement System\nAES has developed a set of Management System procedures to manage the implementation of the elements of the RMP program. The management system details the scope, purpose, responsibilities and upkeep of each RMP element.\n\nOff-site Cons"

      "SummaryText": "equence Analysis\nAs required by the RMP rule, the worst case release scenario (WCRS) is the highly unlikely catastrophic rupture of one of the aqueous ammonia storage tanks. The 15,000-gallon tank is limited to 85% of the storage capacity, 12,750 gallons, by administrative controls, including operating procedures and high level alarms.  The USEPA's RMP*Comp, version 1.07 was used in the analysis.  Passive mitigation exists in the form of a dike around the tank, which limits the spread of ammonia.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS), although unlikely, is a more realistic scenario than the worst-case scenario.  It was analyzed as split or leak in the ammonia tank truck unloading hose.  The tanker truck pumping rate is 80-gpm, which is the release rate used in the analysis.  A team of AES personnel projected that it would take maximum of 10 minutes to fully stop the leak.  The EPA's RMP*Comp. Version 1.07 was used in the analysis.  Based on the analysis, public receptors would be affected by the alternative release scenario.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAES is subject Program 2 of EPA's RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention program at AES includes:\n\nSafety Information\nAES maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner.  These documents include information concerning the hazards of ammonia, process technology, and process equipment.  This information is updated when changes in the process occur. \n\nInformation concerning the hazards of ammonia includes toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical, reactivity, corrosivity, thermal and stability data, and the effects of inadvertent mixing.\n\nInformation concerning the process technology includes process flow information, process chemistry, maximum intended inventory information, safe upper and lower process limits, and consequences of deviating from safe limits.\n\nInformation conce"

The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, generally accepted  industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  AES has a system in place to ensure that the analysis recommendations are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAES maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including initial startup, normal startups and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, emergency operations, normal operations and temporary operations.  The procedures also discuss safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from the safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operations.  The procedures are readily available to operations personnel, and are reviewed annually by team leaders.\n\nTraining\nAll operations personnel of AES are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia process and the procedures to safely operate the process.  Operations personnel will receive refresher training every three years.  In addition, all employees are given general awareness training on RMP, the hazards of aqueous ammonia and general emergency response.\n\nMaintenance\nAES has implemented practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The program includes:  (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment in the ammonia process and critical safety equipment, (2) developing wri"

The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel (including contractors). \n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, AES will conduct a compliance audit every three years.  The plant will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\nAdditional Safety Systems\nAES has additional systems in place to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, as well as systems to lessen the impact of accidental releases.  These systems include:\n\nPressure relief valves\nShut off valves\nLevel gauges and indicators\n\nFive Year Accident History\nAES is scheduled to begin commercial operation in September 2002.  Therefore, there have been no RMP reportable accidents at the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAES maintains a written defensive emergency response program.  The program addresses appropriate aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and personnel accounting, notification of emergency response agencies and the public in the event of a release.  The emergency response program is coordinated with the Hood County Local Emergency Planning Committee."
