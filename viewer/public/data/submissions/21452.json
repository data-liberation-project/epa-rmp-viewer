We operate in 45 states with over 5,500 employees. We are the industry leader in gallons distributed and customers served, and we continuously strive to be the industry leader in safety innovation and practices. We constantly endeavor to improve our safety performance as it relates to our employees, our customers, the environment and the general public with whom we work. \n\nAmeriGas staffs a professional Safety Department at our Corporate Headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. AmeriGas also has six Regional Safety Managers, an Operations Safety Manager , a Safety & Technology Manager, and a Logistics & Supply Safety Manager strategically located throughout the United States. Terminal locations are staffed with a Regional Logistics Manager, who has received extensive safety management training.

The same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce potential hazards to our own personal health and safety as well as our coworkers, and to reduce the potential hazard to nearby members of the community. It is our Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Fe"

Safe handling of propane is dependent upon a number of factors, including the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures, and the continuous training of our personnel.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to store and distribute propane to wholesale customers and AmeriGas retail locations. Propane is primarily used by our customers as a fuel. Propane is received by transport truck and barges, and stored in bulk storage tanks. Propane is distributed to wholesale customers and other AmeriGas locations by bobtails and transport trucks. This facility has specialized equipment for unloading and loading propane. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is propane. \n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 3,213,757 pounds. \n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario\n\nInformation concerning the Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Scenario for this facility are contained in the appropriate Sections of the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan, Accidental Release Program and Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThis AmeriGas propane storage and distribution facility complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58. All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the National Propane Gas Association's Certified Employee Training Program (CETP). The worst-case scenario and alternative scenario have an extremely small chance of occurring. Our propane storage tanks are designed for propane and butane service and may remain in service indefinitely. Our preventative maintenance program ensures that our bulk storage tanks a"

A representative of the Florida Bureau of LP Gas visited and inspected this facility on 05/12/98.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility was constructed in 1950 and is in compliance with NFPA-58 Standard. In June of 2000, we plan to place guard posts along plant piping to protect from vehicle contact. And July 2000 we plan to replace 150 PSIG valves on the barge dock with 300 PSIG valves and flanges. These planned changes will meet and / or exceed NFPA-58, 1998 Edition."
