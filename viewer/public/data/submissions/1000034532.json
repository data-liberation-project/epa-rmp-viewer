The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 2243 Highway 36 in Wathena, Kansas (the \"site\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There are three anhydrous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility, one tank with a maximum capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons and two tanks with a maximum capacity of approximately 12,000 gallons each.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into nurse tanks each with a capacity of 1,000 gallons.  A maximum total of 70 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n  \n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and impl"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures, in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications, to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Wathena Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures.  The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n\n\n\n1.    Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\n\n2.    Information on emergency health care.\n\n3.    Emergency response training for employees.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPlans to improve safety at the facility were developed based on the results of a site assessment by an outside con"

Develop equipment specific replacement schedules and maintain documentation.\n\n2.    Document routinely scheduled maintenance inspections and maintain files.\n\n3.    Document that maintenance repairs/replacements are compliant with ANSI, ASME, and OSHA standards for ammonia systems.\n\n4.    Investigate potential for automatic/interlocked liquid shut off valves with liquid level indicators.\n\n5.    Evaluate potential installation of a security system to protect the ammonia process.\n\n6.    Install additional bollards around the nurse tank filling stations and the storage tanks.\n\n7.    Document employee training on anhydrous ammonia handling, standard operating procedures and emergency response procedures which will be conducted prior to each of the anhydrous ammonia distribution seasons.\n\n8.    Install a wind sock in a prominent location for emergency response and evacuation. \n\n9.    Install emergency shut off valves for the storage tanks which will be activated with a remote controller.  These valves will be activated in the event of a possible ammonia release due to piping or appurtenance failure.\n\n"
