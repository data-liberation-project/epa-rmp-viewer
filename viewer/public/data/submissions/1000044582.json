This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers Section 112r regulated substances maintained at the Junction City Water Treatment Plant, which will be referred to herein as the Plant.\n\n\n\nPlant Description: The Plant maintains only one regulated substance on site: chlorine. Maximum chlorine storage is 12,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds. The storage and management of chlorine are addressed in this RMP. The Plant is located at 2101 N. Jackson, Junction City, Kansas, which is an urban area. The surrounding area contains some small housing developments, and the downtown area of Junction City is approximately one mile from the Plant.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment: A process hazard assessment was performed on the chlorine system beginning with cylinder unloading and ending with the chlorine in solution. A checklist and modified \"What if\" analysis were used. In the checklist analysis, general questions regarding the storage and use areas, as well as protocols associated with the management of the chlorination system, were answered. A copy of the checklist is included in the plan. Following the checklist, each valve, line and piece of equipment in the system was assessed from the cylinder to point of chlorine injection using a system flow diagram. The valves and other points in the system where chlorine could be released are numbered on the flow diagram. The assessment is formatted in accordance with those numbers. Compliance with code requirements, potential failures, maintenance and inspection concerns, and standard operating procedures were reviewed for each point in the system. Comments are summarized in the Process Hazard Assessment section.\n\n\n\nPrevention System: The Plant has an operation, maintenance and inspection system designed to review each element o"

      "SummaryText": "f the chlorination system routinely. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel receive significant training before being allowed to work on the system. No work on the chlorine system is done without the Facilities Supervisor being present. At the beginning and end of the daily operating period, and as each cylinder is changed, the valves and piping are tested for leaks. There are Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for startup, shutdown, normal operation, and emergency operation. The SOPs are written and posted in the appropriate areas. Personnel are trained routinely on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. The system is equipped with chlorine detectors in both the chlorine feed and storage rooms and alarms that indicate leaks. Ventilation is provided in the chlorine room only when a worker is present. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan: Plant personnel are allowed and trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by turning off a valve. Any response requiring entry in a dangerous atmosphere or use of a chlorine repair kit is to be managed by the Fort Riley Fire Department. The Plant has an agreement with the Fort Riley Fire Department, which is included in the Plan. A complete copy of the Emergency Reponse Plan is also included in this Plan.\n\n\n\nAccident History: The Plant has had no chlorine releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEquipment Replacement: The Chlorine Feed System was replaced in 2005 to modernize equipment and replace all piping and appurtenances. The Plant Operations Staff were included in the design and installation of the system so that their experience could be included and a thorough knowledge of the new system could be gained. Several lessons from the past were incorporated in the new design including a simple industry standard set of equipment and an open architecture that makes operation, maintenance, and fault detection easily within the skill set of the s"

The Treatment Plant received a nationally recognized safety achievment award in 2006. The facility also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management program for this substance. Veolia and the City of Junction City partner closely to continue pursuing methods and equipment to improve the safe handling and storage of all on-site chemicals."
