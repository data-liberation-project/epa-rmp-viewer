If an accidental release should occur, our facility is prepared to \n\nwork with the Riceville Fire Department, the Howard County LEPC and any other authorities to mitigate and \n\nminimize the impact of the release to the people of this community and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of this facility is the sale of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, \n\nis received stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  NH3 is stored in tanks \n\ndesigned for this purpose.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n\n\nAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental \n\nrelease have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regulation.  \n\n\"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and our state regulations covering NH3.  The \n\nOSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form.  (Section 8.3 b.)\n\n\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWe have had NO accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have \n\ncaused any deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, or environmental damage\n\nat our facility.  To the best of our knowledge, there have been NO off-site accidental releases \n\nresulting in death, injury, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nThis facility has:\n\n\n\n  A. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\n\n  B.
