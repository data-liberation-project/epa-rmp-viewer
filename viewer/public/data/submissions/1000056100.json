We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nA. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Peco Foods, Pocahontas, AR, Facility\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. The facility maintains an ongoing emergency response program that prepares for safe evacuation and timely response by trained personnel. The (Refrigeration Superintendent) is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. Peco Foods processes and freezes chicken products for global distribution. Approximately 67,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system on the site at Peco Foods - Pocahontas, AR. A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia f"
