This program is referred to as the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Plan, or the PSM/RMP program.  The PSM/RMP program covers both components and systems as it relates to anhydrous ammonia and propane.\n\n2.  PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is acutely hazardous and propane a flammable material as defined by the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA 40 CFR 68.  The threshold quantity for these materials is established in appendix A of OSHA 1910.119 at 10,000-pounds.  The CalARP program establishes a 500-pound threshold quantity.  The Ito Packing Company system is thus subject to the requirements of both the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, the Process Safety Management Standard and the Cal ARP requirements.\n\nThe two materials are 72,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is required for the operation of the cold storage units; and 80,000 lbs of propane, which is used strictly for filling the fuel tanks of forklifts and ranch vehicles.\n\nThe ammonia storage/receiver tank is located in a secured area authorized for technicians only.  The propane is stored in 2 tanks on the eastside of the plant and access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees and managements personnel.  Both products are received via truck from authorized and trained distributors.\n\n\n\n4.  The Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\n\nIto Packing Company has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\nIto Packing Company maintains a detailed record of written safety information, which describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipments designs associated with all aspects of our distribution facility.\n\nHazard Review\nA checklist methodolog"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with extensive knowledge of facility operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Ito Packing Company maintains writtten operating procedures, computerized monitoring of ammonia refrigeration systems and various alarm functions.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial starup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nIto Packing Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided annually, when certification requires, or change warrants.\n\nMaintenance\nIto Packing Company carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functioning.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in these practices.  Furthermore, personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment dificiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIto Packing Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are bei"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nIto Packing Company has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nIto Packing Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of ammonia or propane.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nOur facility's emergency response plan is based upon the OSHA PSM and EPA's RMP, compliance standard, IIAR Guide to Good Practices, MSDS for anhydrous ammonia and propane,\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.
