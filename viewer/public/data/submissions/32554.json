Our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing PSM. Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4.

Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had one accident resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. The accident is deemed RMP-reportable because the releases resulted in an onsite personnel injury that required medical treatment.  No offsite consequences occurred due to this incident. We have conducted a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  The following is a brief summary of the incident and the investigation results.\n\nOn August 18, 2000, an operator completed loading of an ethylene railcar, applied steam to the exterior of the loading hoses to vaporize any ethylene left in the hose, and depressured the hoses.
