This facility is designed to treat up to 20 million gallons per day of sewage as well as hauled liquid wastes from Septic Tanks, Grease traps, landfill and rublle fill leachates and water treatment plant residuals from facilities located within the geographical boundaries of Harford County.  This facility uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for wastewater disinfection and dechlorination.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are transported, stored and fed from one ton containers.  Harford County trains all operators in safe handling procedures, including Hazardous Materials Operations tailored to the chemicals and equipment used osnite.  Personal Protective Equipment requirements are trained and strictly enforced by all levels of management.  The County's aggressive training and strict adherence to established procedures have resulted in this facility's  excellent safety record with no reportable incidents.  Harford County retains Denora Water Technologies Inc. to provide professional service related to major work involving these chemical systems.  All contractors are required to receive training in and adhere to Harford County established procedures in order to work on the chlorination and de-chlorination systems.  Harford County's commitment to the safety of its employees and citizens is a continuous effort.  The County is constantly looking for ways to limit employee and public exposure to toxic substances from their facilites and continues to pursue technological and training advances to assure continued success of this already highly successful program."
