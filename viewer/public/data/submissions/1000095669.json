To reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, the Station uses anhydrous ammonia, which is classified as an acutely hazardous material in the state of California. The Station stores anhydrous ammonia in a 12,000-gallon aboveground storage tank. SoCalGas has a strong safety culture and takes their safety obligations very seriously, ensuring that operators involved in the use of anhydrous ammonia are trained and knowledgeable in the chemical hazards associated with their jobs. \r\nThe following Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, some of the steps taken to ensure a safely operating Station, and how chemical emergencies are&#8239;handled. This RMP complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter&#8239;4.5 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 40, Part 68. \r\n\r\nES.2 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe SoCalGas accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. Applicable procedures of the State of California are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\nSoCalGas management recognizes the responsibility to make the environment, community, and employee safety a primary part of daily concerns. SoCalGas is committed to being a responsible member in the community by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.

Anhydrous ammonia is a covered chemical under state and federal RMP regulations.  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000-gallon capacity storage tank. Mechanical controls limit the capacity of the tank to 80 percent of maximum capacity. The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia is approximately 54,300 pounds (approximately 10,500 gallons). This quantity exceeds the CalARP threshold of 500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and the federal EPA RMP threshold and Process Safety Management (PSM) threshold of 10,000&#8239;pounds of ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia process is subject to Program Level 3. \r\n\r\nES.4 Summary of the 5-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThe Station has"

Ongoing emergency response training provides the personnel and resources familiarity with procedures and available resources. \r\n\r\nES.5 Summary of the Emergency Response Program \r\n\r\nSoCalGas has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the Station, which establishes emergency response procedures designed to protect personnel, to limit damage to the environment, and to ensure that proper notifications are made to the appropriate government agencies. The EAP details the response procedures, protective measures, levels of training, regulatory notification requirements, and post-incident follow-up procedures. The EAP also identifies emergency assembly areas, evacuation routes, and related procedures to be undertaken during emergency scenarios.  \r\n\r\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release, the highest-ranking operations person on site will assess whether the release is controllable or uncontrollable. If the release is controllable, trained personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the highest-ranking person on site will notify the Kern County Fire Department. The Kern County Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation.  \r\n\r\nThe EAP is coordinated (reviewed) by the Kern County Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.

The Station has developed a written employee participation plan to describe how employees are involved in developing the RMP/PSM program and how they will continue to be involved in future modifications to the program. \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information \r\nThe Station compiles and maintains up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substances, processes, and equipment at the Station. This information is used to identify and understand the hazards in operating the anhydrous ammonia process. The safety information includes safety data sheets, a process description, maximum intended inventory, safe operating limits, equipment specifications, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the system.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis \r\nThe Station conducts hazard reviews or process hazard analyses (PHA) to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The hazard review identifies the process hazards, opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors, safeguards used to control hazards, and steps used to detect or monitor releases. The hazard review is revalidated or updated at least once every 5&#8239;years.

Procedures will be certified annually to validate that the content is current and accurately reflect current process safety information and/or industry standards. \r\n\r\nTraining \r\nThe Station has developed an overall written plan of action to implement and maintain training requirements. The plan specifically includes participation of employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia processes in the hazard review. Employees must be trained on anhydrous ammonia operating or maintenance procedures, safety and health hazards, and safe work practices before they can operate or maintain the covered process. The Station has developed a written employee training program and associated training materials and training records. The training program includes initial training, refresher training, and documentation of the training.

An effective maintenance program addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, personnel training, and correction of equipment deficiencies. Preventative maintenance is performed according to equipment manufacturers' recommendations. The operations staff conduct scheduled rounds while the maintenance staff perform daily checks and visual observations as part of the routine site walkthrough.  \r\n\r\nHot Work Permits \r\nEmployees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the covered process.
