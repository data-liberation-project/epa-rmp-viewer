Ongoing emergency response training provides the personnel and resources familiarity with procedures and available resources. \n\n\n\nES.5 Summary of the Emergency Response Program \n\n\n\nSoCalGas has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the Station, which establishes emergency response procedures designed to protect personnel, to limit damage to the environment, and to ensure that proper notifications are made to the appropriate government agencies. The EAP details the response procedures, protective measures, levels of training, regulatory notification requirements, and post-incident follow-up procedures. The EAP also identifies emergency assembly areas, evacuation routes, and related procedures to be undertaken during emergency scenarios.  \n\n\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release, the highest-ranking operations person on site will assess whether the release is controllable or uncontrollable. If the release is controllable, trained personnel will perform the tasks necessary to accomplish containment and mitigation of the release. If the release is uncontrollable, the highest-ranking person on site will notify the Kern County Fire Department. The Kern County Fire Department will handle spill/release response and mitigation.  \n\n\n\nThe EAP is coordinated (reviewed) by the Kern County Fire Department, which is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee.
