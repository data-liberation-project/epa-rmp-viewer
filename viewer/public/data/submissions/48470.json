      "SummaryText": "NORTHEAST COOP WISNER BRANCH  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nNORTHEAST COOP  complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify KEN DUNCAN CUMING COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE IN COORDINATION WITH THE WISNER FIRE DEPARTMENT and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  \n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed  for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\nThe maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia storage tank is ________74,160___ pounds. (Optional)\n\n3.  The Worst-case release scenario.\n\nWe used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. \nThe alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThe facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The facility has implemented the provisions of  \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \u00bfStorage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\u00bf.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history."

      "SummaryText": "or.  This gas can be liquefied by cooling or by applying pressure.  In appearance, liquid anhydrous ammonia resembles water.  The boiling point at atmospheric pressure is -28 degrees F.  Above 900 degrees F, ammonia begins to decompose, reverting to hydrogen and nitrogen.  At -107.9 degrees F., anhydrous ammonia freezes to form white crystals.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is a relatively stable compound and is extremely hard to ignite.  Ammonia gas is flammable in air in the range of 16%-25% by volume with an ignition temperature of 1562 degrees F.  Conditions favorable for ignition are seldom encountered during normal operations due to the high lower limit, narrow range, and the high ignition temperature required.  However, the release of ammonia gas into a tightly enclosed or inadequately ventilated space may result in the accumulation of a flammable mixture that can cause a combustion explosion if a high temperature ignition source is present.\n4\tEquipment Specifications\n\nNORTHEAST COOP will strive to keep on record all equipment specifications for bulk storage tanks, piping, pressure relief valves, temperature, pressure, and level gauges, valves, pumps, compressors, and hoses.\n5\tCodes and Standards used to design, build, and operate our facilities.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nProcess Safety Information for Anhydrous Ammonia Storage\t\nMSDS for Anhydrous Ammonia\t\nMaximum Intended Inventory\t74160\nNominal Water Capacity of Largest Tank\t14400 GALLONS\nTemperature\tUpper:  ambient max. 110 F         OK\nLower:  ambient min. -15 F\nPressure\tUpper:  240 PSI @ 110 F             OK\nLower:  35 PSI @ -15 F\nFlow Rate\tLoading: 120 G.P.M.\nUnloading:  41 G.P.M.\nVapor Piping\t250 PSIG   OK\nLiquid Piping and Compressor Discharge\t350 PSIG   OK\nSafety Relief Valves\n\n\nRV1  ORIGINAL\nRV2  ORIGINAL\nRV3  ORIGINAL\nRV4  ORIGINAL\tEach valve relieves    SCFM/air, three are required at all times, a fourth is provided to allow maintenance\nReplaced: ALL NEED REPLACED IN \nReplaced: 2004\nReplaced: \nReplaced: \nInte"
