Corporate company policies that address the use of hazardous products within all facilities include, Equipment Maintenance Policy, Housekeeping Policy, Personal Protective Policy, Contractor Safety Policy, First Aid Procedures, and a company wide Emergency Action and Response Plan.  These plans and polices are designed to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and to properly address a chemical release should it occur.\n\n\n\nOur company does store 303,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, in bulk containers, located ? mile east of Pickrell, Nebraska, for sale to surrounding farmers as a gaseous form of fertilizer.  Because of the hazardous nature of this chemical, CountrySide Cooperative has developed a strict policy of routine and preventive maintenance on the Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Facility located one half mile east of Pickrell, Nebraska on Pickrell Road.  Routine maintenance and regular inspections reduce the likelihood of an accidental release because of equipment malfunction or failure.  All maintenance on portable or permanent bulk containers is documented and the General Manager, Site Manager, and Safety Compliance Manager routinely audits all maintenance documents.  All employees working near this chemical have been trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, rain gear, boots, gas masks, full body protective gear, and eye goggles.  All employees that work within the anhydrous ammonia plant are required to attend annual anhydrous ammonia safety training offered by CountrySide Cooperative, Nebraska Fertilizer and Chemical Institute, the Nebraska Grain and Feed Dealers Assn., or other training sessions provided by various industry representatives and manufactures.  Company safety meetings are held at various times throughout the year and alway"

      "SummaryText": "s prior to the season of chemical use.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for our facility would result in a loss of 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia that would travel a distance of 6.9 miles.  Should a release occur, the vapor cloud could affect up to 2934 people in the area encompassed by the 6.9 mile radius.  Public receptors included in this radius would include the community of Pickrell, Nebraska and the extreme northern edge of Beatrice, Nebraska.  No schools, hospitals, prisons, or recreation areas would be included inside this 6.9 mile radius.  There are no environmental receptors located within our worst case radius.  The likelihood of a total release is minimal because of back check valves installed on all bulk containers and manual shut off valves to all plumbing and piping from the bulk container.  While the possibility of a worst case release is minimal, our company has met with the local Fire Department response team and the local Emergency Planning Coordinator and have developed a plan of action in the event that a major release should occur.  This plan includes evacuation procedures if necessary, water spray to reduce the vapor cloud, and construction of an earthen dike to contain any contaminated runoff.  Modeling for this scenario was prepared using RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for our facility would result in the release of 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a ruptured liquid hose or pipe at the load out riser.  226 people could be affected, within a 1.3 mile radius of the plant.  The only public receptors within this radius would be the community of Pickrell, Nebraska.  There are no schools, hospitals, prisons, or recreation areas within the 1.3 mile radius.  There are no environmental receptors within this 1.3 mile radius.  Back flow check valves installed up line from the hose or pipe will shut off any flow should a hose or pipe rupture occur.

A water spray to knock down a vapor cloud would be available from our local Fire Department, located one half mile west of the Pickrell plant.  Protective equipment is available on site should an employee need to enter the area to manually shut off a valve.  Modeling for this scenario was prepared using RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nIn the last five years we have recorded no spills that resulted in an offsite impact on any people or the environment.  On an annual basis we will conduct a tour of the anhydrous ammonia plant with the local Fire Department and the LEPC for our area.  The Nebraska State Fire Marshall checks all anhydrous ammonia plants in the state at least once a year and on a random basis.\n\n"
