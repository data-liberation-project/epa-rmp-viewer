      "SummaryText": "The Cow Island Plant is a natural gas condensate, amine treating and gas dehydration facility (\"Facility\"), which utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance (10,000 pounds)\" in the processing of natural gas.  The natural gas condensate is an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Cow Island Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Cow Island Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Cow Island Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Cow Island Plant employs five (5) full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Crosstex Energy, last submitted a full RMP the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in May 2012 for the Cow Island Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates associated with the change from Crosstex Energy to EnLink.     \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Cow Island Pl"

Natural gas condensate is a flammable hydrocarbon mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated flammables: ethane, propane, N-butane, and N-pentane.  Although the current EnLink Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for natural gas condensate lists the material as a National Fire Protection Association Class 3 Flammable, the actual flammability rating may vary based upon the percentage of flammable materials present in the batch.  Therefore, EnLink has chosen to list natural gas condensate as an RMP-regulated flammable for the Cow Island Plant.  The Cow Island Plant is also an amine treatment facility.  The amine used at the Cow Island Plant is not RMP-regulated due to its lack of RMP-regulated components.\n\n\n\nNatural gas condensate may also contain hydrogen sulfide (an RMP-regulated toxic) in varying quantities, depending on the geographic location of the gas, geologic formation from which the gas was extracted, temperature and pressure. The Cow Island Plant does not accept gas that contains greater than 1 percent hydrogen sulfide; therefore, the hydrogen sulfide is not required to be considered as an RMP-regulated toxic at the Facility.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of natural gas condensate (RMP-regulated flammable) at the Facility at any given time is 134,700 gallons (890,000 lbs).  The largest vessel conta"

As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Cow Island Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include:  \n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation, \n\n?    Process Safety Information, \n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis, \n\n?    Operating Procedures, \n\n?    Training, \n\n?    Contractors, \n\n?    Pre-startup Review, \n\n?    Mechanical Integrity, \n\n?    Hot Work Permits, \n\n?    Management of Change, \n\n?    Incident Investigation, and \n\n?    Compliance Audits.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Cow Island Plant has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to April 2012.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\n?    Public and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\n?    Proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\n?    Emergency response measures; \n\n?    Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining emergency response equipment; \n\n?    Employee training; and \n\n?    Program review procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Cow Island Plant maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance for em"

Furthermore, the Facility has coordinated the emergency response plan with the Vermillion Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Kaplan Fire Department. The Kaplan Fire Department is designated as the first responder in the event of natural gas condensate release.  For these reasons, the Cow Island Plant meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program as described in 40 CFR 68.95.  \n\n\n\nA site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. Complete details on the Emergency Action Plan required under the PSM Rules are included in the Cow Island Plant's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.   \n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\n\n\nEnLink has a continued commitment to update equipment and improve safety pertaining to the covered process when necessary.  The most recent Process Hazard Analysis for the Facility was completed on April 29-30, 2010, at which time several safety improvements were recommended including equipment upgrades, updates to P&IDs, and other safety controls.
