We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\nThis RMP re-submittal is being completed due to changes in personnel, date changes, and an updated Process Hazard Analysis . A Process Hazard Analysis study was conducted for the processing refrigeration system in April 2010. \r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\r\nNestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream is located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.  We manufacture some of the finest ice cream in the world.  The facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities.  Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization system.  The facility produces and ships approximately 247 million pounds of finished product each year.\r\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains in excess of 70,745 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\r\nNestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of cata"

These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected employees are to notify the onsite Hazmat Responder and ERC Coordinator.  The Hazmat Responder takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the Hazmat Responder determines that the ammonia level is above 35 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\r\nThe Hazmat Responder determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.  If outside assistance is needed the local HAZMAT organization is contacted.  Also Nestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream Emergency Response Team is contacted.  The Hazmat Responder then take appropriate procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures, to control the leak with personal protective devices in place.\r\nOnce the Incident Commander arrives on scene, a report is given and the Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\r\nNestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Nestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system. As part of ongoing on site training Edys trains with the local HAZMAT responders. \r\nNestle Dreyers Grand Ice Cream has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library consisting of nine numbered volumes, some volume numbers are assigned to sets of reference manuals, such as Operation and Maintenance manuals.
