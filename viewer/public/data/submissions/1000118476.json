In addition, we are committed to continuous improvement through the chemical industry's Responsible Distribution Program (RD) through the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  \n\nAs part of our Quality Assurance, CFATs and RD commitments, we make health, safety and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new operations, products, processes and facilities.  \n\nWe have had ZERO reportable releases in the previous 5 years.\n\nDescription of the Facility and Regulated Substances.  \n\nSAL Chemical's operations include warehousing, repackaging, and distribution of municipal and industrial type chemicals.  SAL Chemical maintains an inventory of chlorine that exceeds the EPA's threshold.  \n\nSAL may have up to 51,000# of chlorine stored outdoors in both 2000# and 150# cylinders.  \n\nThe chlorine storage and distribution operation is regulated by OSHA's PSM rule and therefore is a Program 3 process.  The worst case release of chlorine at the facility would be a catastrophic release of 2000# of chlorine from a one ton container over a 10 minute period.  The extent of the release was calculated without taking credit for any mitigating factors, which are in accordance with EPA requirements for calculation the effects of a worst case release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of .0087 mg/L is 1.3 miles, which would potentially impact a residential population of 2700.  EPA's model RMPComp was used in estimating the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The US census bureau internet site was used to determine the population.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a one ton container leak from a one half inch diameter hole, resulting in a leak of 34 pounds per minute of liquid chlorine.  It is estimated that the leak could continue for 60 minutes"

This release would be mitigated by Sal Chemical's storage and inspection programs.  The containers are stored away from vehicular traffic, and the containers are inspected daily.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for this scenario is .1 mile, which would not reach a public receptor.  The release rate was derived from EPA's RMP guidance for wastewater treatment plants, and the distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated using RMP Comp.  The residential population was estimated from the US census bureau's internet site.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  \n\nSAL is an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and applies the NACD's strict principals for safe distribution of chemical.  Sal Chemical also uses elements of an OSHA PSM program for chlorine operations.  The PSM program contains 12 elements, including a hazard analysis, standard operating procedures, employee training, compliance audits, incident investigations, and management of change. In addition to the PSM program, Jason Mattern, our Quality and Regulatory Compliance Manager, gives an annual training on the safe handling and storage of Chlorine.  Jason's training program is certified in the state of Ohio to award 2 hours of Continuing Education Credits.  \n\nAnnually, the Weirton Fire Department tours our facility for review and critique.  Jason is also a 20 year member of the Hancock County LEPC and is currently serving the elected position of Secretary.\n\nFive Year Accident History.  \n\nSAL Chemical has had no accidental releases of any chemical in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program.  \n\nSAL Chemical maintains, and coordinates a written Emergency Action Plan with both the Brooke and Hancock County LEPC and Weirton Fire Department.

SAL Chemical will also continue providing training to its employees on the safe handling of regulated substances.  Our health and safety manual was reviewed and integrated into our ICP plan in July 2024.
