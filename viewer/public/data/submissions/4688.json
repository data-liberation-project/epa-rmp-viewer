Introduction:\nThe  Royster-Clark  Nitrogen terminal in Meredosia  receives\nfertilizers from barges, stores the fertilizer in tanks, and\nloads  trucks.  The facility has one anhydrous ammonia  tank\nand  four  urea  ammonium  nitrate (UAN)  liquid  fertilizer\nstorage tanks.\n.\nB.  Accidental Release Record:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Meredosia Terminal, has an\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\nto facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964.\n\nThe facility safety record is the direct result of continued\nemphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors,\nand truck drivers.  There have not been any releases from\nthe terminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental\nrelease.\n\nC.   General Accidental Release Prevention  Policies And\n  Activities:\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and concern for the\nenvironment must be second nature to all employees and\ncontractor personnel.\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works together to\nensure the facility is in compliance with OSHA's Process\nSafety Management standards and the accident prevention\nprograms are continuously improved.  A networked computer\nmanagement system is utilized to provide our employees with\nthe necessary tools and records to maintain the safety of\nthe process.  This teamwork is an integral part in the\nsafety efforts of this facility.\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen\nelement program for Process Safety Management, a management\nsystem, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on\ncontinuous improvement.\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to\nparticipate in the facility's safety program.  Examples of\nemployee participation include participation in Process\nHazard Analyses, cooperative training, updating of operating\nprocedures, and emergency response activities.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has well established practices and\nprocedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems,\nrelief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and\nemergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.\nThis program includes:\n\n     1.   training\n     2.   written operating procedures\n     3.   inspections and tests in accordance with recognized\n       standards,\n4.   correction of deficiencies, and\n     5.   quality assurance\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that\nmaintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on  (1) an overview\nof the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency\nresponse plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices to\nhelp ensure that they can perform their job in a safe\nmanner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is\nperformed in a consistent manner, conforms to generally\naccepted standards, and provides a basis for training.\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that\nequipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment\nis within acceptable limits\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive system to manage\nchanges to processes.  This system requires that changes to\nitems such as process equipment, chemicals, technology,\nprocedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed\nand authorized before being implemented.\n\nD.  Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency requires the worst case\nscenario to be a catastrophic rupture of the terminal's\nammonia storage tank with a compete loss of product over 10\nminutes. The tank is included in the facility's mechanical\nintegrity inspection and testing program.  Acoustic Emission\ntesting was completed in June of 1998.  The testing\nindicated the tank to be in good condition.  Other safeguard\ninclude pressure and temperature instrumentation, multiple\nlevels of relief devices, a refrigeration compressor system,\nand well trained and experienced operators.  The E"

      "SummaryText": "PA does\nnot allow any of these safeguards to be considered in the\nworst case scenario.\n\n\nIn regard to worst case scenarios, EPA say's:\n\n     \"Because the assumptions required for the worst\n     - case analysis are very conservative, the\n     results likely will be very conservative.  These\n     endpoints are concentrations below which it is\n     believed nearly all individuals could be exposed\n     for one-half hour to one hour without any\n     serious health effects.  In addition,  the worst\n     case analysis is carried out using very\n     conservative assumptions about weather and\n     release conditions.  The distance to the\n     endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions\n     should not be considered a zone in which the\n     public would be likely in danger;  instead, it\n     is intended to provide an estimate of the\n     maximum possible area that might be affected in\n     the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.\n     Distances greater than 10 kilometers are\n     particularly uncertain.  EPA intends the\n     estimated distances to provide a basis for\n     discussion. rather than a basis for specific\n     actions.\"\n\n\nBecause of the routine testing, in plant safety systems,\ndaily visual inspections, and intensive operations training,\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes the worst case scenario to\nbe extremely unlikely to happen.\n\nE.  Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Scenario:\n\nThe conditions picked for the alternative case scenario are\nthose which would create a maximum amount of loss of\nanhydrous ammonia from a vessel of ammonia.  The scenario\ninvolves breakage of the sight glass and failure of the\nammonia check valve resulting in loss of 100 gallons of hot\nanhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere.\n\n\nF.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Meredosia Terminal has an\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\nto any of its personnel.  In addition, the terminal has\noperated without a lost time accident for over twenty-five\nyears.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "There  have  not been any incidents that meet the definition\nof a RMP recordable release.\n\nG.  Emergency Response:\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers accidental\nreleases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency\nresponse practices and procedures,   and  process safety\ntopics.  The plan is reviewed at least annually with all\nemployees.\n\nz     All  permanent  employees  have  the  required  Hazmat\n  training, including an eight hour refresher course annually.\n  Each  employee and permanent contractor is trained on  the\n  facility's  Emergency Response policies and procedures  at\n  regularly scheduled plant safety meetings.\n\nz     The  terminal manager and his assistant attend monthly\n  Community Advisory Panel meetings. This panel includes other\n  area  industries, Meredosia Village board  members,  local\n  emergency   response  agencies,  community  leaders,   and\n  citizens.\n\nz    The Emergency Response Plan is followed in the event of\n  an emergency. The emergency  alarm system is tested  once\n  each month and an emergency drill is held at lease annually.\n\n\nH.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n  The   Royster-Clark  Nitrogen  Meredosia   Terminal   will\n  utilize   employee  input  and  industry  best  management\n  practices  to  continuously improve safety, environmental,\n  and all operations.\n\nI.  Summary:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Meredosia Terminal and its\nemployees are extremely proud of its safety record and the\nvast improvements in both safety and environmental.  We\nbelieve that with the programs and policies in place in our\nterminal and the continued efforts of 100% of our personnel,\nwe will be able to maintain our safety record and a safe\nplant environment for all concerned in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n                              \n\n\n"
