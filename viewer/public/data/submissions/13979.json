This evaluation was performed to assure that the facilities\nchlorine injection system complies with applicable regulations.  Key elements of the Risk\nManagement Plan provided by Watts Engineers included:  a review of the accidental release\nprevention and emergency response policies; a review of the regulated substance handled; a\nworst-case and an alternative release scenario; a review of the general accidental release\nprevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; a review of the five-year accident\nhistory; a review the emergency response program; and participation in meetings and planning\nchanges to improve the Process Safety Program.   Watts Engineers will electronically submit this\nRisk Management Plan to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by June 21, 1999.  \n\n     The Oswego West Side WWTP is located on the West Side of the City of Oswego\nbetween the Niagara Mohawk Power Station and the old oil refinery.  It employs twenty (20)\nfull-time employees.  Activities at the facility include the treatment of sewage, removal of solid\nwaste, and the treatment of the water portion with the addition of chlorine gas before returning\nthe water to Lake Ontario.  \n\n     Chlorine is considered a regulated substance under the Risk Management and Process\nSafety Programs.  Characteristics of this gas or liquid include a pungent suffocating odor.  It is\nirritating to the mucous membranes.  When chlorine reacts with water, it forms hydrochloric\nacid.  Hydrochl"

      "SummaryText": "oric acid gas is a toxic and corrosive fume.  The odor threshold for chlorine is\nabout 0.5 ppm.  Long term exposures to small concentrations or short term exposures to high\nconcentrations may result in adverse health effects.  Since chlorine gas is heavier then air,  It can\nsettle in low spots along the ground, therefore, care should be exercised while working in\nconfined spaces or low lying areas.  \n\n     The City of Oswego and senior management at the West Side Wastewater Treatment\nPlant have a strong commitment to the overall safety of it's employees, the public, and\nthe environment.  It is the policy of the West Side WWTP to train each employee and contractor\nabout safety considerations and emergency procedures in the unlikely event of a discharge.  A\nmaximum of four thousand (4,000) pounds of chlorine gas in two (2) tanks gas are either used or\nstored at one time at the facility.  Each tank contains two thousand (2,000) pounds of chlorine\ngas. The chlorine is composed of 99.5 percent chlorine and 0.5 percent inert ingredients.  The\ntanks are located on a storage pad behind the facility.  The storage pad is covered by a canopy\nconstructed of sheets of corrugated steel used for a roof.  The storage area is otherwise open to\nair.  Chlorine is being delivered by truck and unloaded using a two ton crane onto a set of steel\nrails where the gas tank is stored until it is ready for use. Each end of the rails are chocked to\nprevent the gas tanks from rolling.  Each gas tank has it's own valve guard to prevent objects\nfrom coming in contact with the valves.  \n\n     When a chlorine tank is needed, a two ton crane lifts the cylinder and is moved along a\ncrane rail through a set of double steel doors and into the tank scale room.  The tank scale room \nis fully enclosed.  The room is labeled \"chlorine hazard\" and emergency instructions are posted\nat the door.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are located in a common hallway by the\noperators station.  \n\n      Next to the ta"

Here, the chlorine is\ninjected into the wastewater through a series of valves and PVC tubes.\n\n       The chlorine tanks are stored on to a calibrated scale, designed to hold the two, two\nthousand pound tanks on roller trunnions. The chlorine containers have two valves in each head,\nWith the tank in a horizontal position and the valves in a vertical line, they deliver gas from the\nupper valve and liquid from the lower valve.  Five hundred (500) psig copper tubing fitted with a\nspecial adapter is used to connect the tank to the tubing system.  To connect the line to the\ncontainer, a valve protection hood and the valve outlet cap are removed.  A wrench is used to\nconnect the valving to the yoke.  A new gasket, which is supplied with the container is used each\ntime a connection is made.  As part of the Process Safety Management Program leaks are then\nchecked using ammonia vapor.  The appearance of white vapor indicates a chlorine leak.  Gloves\nand a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are worn by the operator while changing tanks. \nIn the past five years, this facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\n     The City of Oswego West Side Wastewater Treatment plant maintains a general\naccidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.  As a part of this\nprogram, a chlorine alarm system is in place at the facility.  The chlorine detector and alarm are\nlocated on the wall outside of the chlorine injection room.  The chlorine sensors are located in the\ninjection room and the tank scale room.  In the event of a chlorine leak, a audio and visual alarm\nwill sound in the operator's control room which is staffed twenty four (24) hours a day, seven\ndays a week.  The monitor is maintained and calibrated by an outside contractor. The calibration\nfrequency is yearly as recommended by the manufacturer.  Lite"

An operator receiving an alarm is to follow the Emergency\nResponse Plan.\n\n     The chlorine injection system itself operates under a vacuum produced by the injector\nmechanism.  Gas leaves the tank through a vacuum regulating valve.  A diaphragm senses\nvacuum on one side and atmospheric pressure on the other.  A spring loaded stem off the seat is\ndisplaced by force on the diaphragm.  Gas moves toward the flow control components and proper\nvacuum is maintained.  While under vacuum, gas enters the rotameter where it's flow is\nmeasured.  Gas flow rate is controlled by a v-notch orifice and either manual or automatic\npositioning of the v-grooved plug in it's ring.  A differential regulating valve is located after the\norifice which maintains the proper vacuum across the v-notch.  A pressure-relief valve vents to\nthe atmosphere if a malfunction occurs and pressure builds.  Gas is then dissolved in the water\nstream at the injector.  Check valves are in place and designed to close on injector shutdown. \nThere are no lines carrying gas under pressure in this system.  Loss of vacuum for any reason\ncauses the vacuum regulating valve to shut off the gas supply.  \n\n     The facility also complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Process Safety\nManagement rule.  Management believes that the training of it's employees and it's contractors is\ncrucial to maintaining a safe environment and continuing it's accident-free record for the chlorine\nsystem.  Training of all employees consists of a general orientation of the chlorine system first. \nThey are then instructed on the hazards and proper and safe handling of the chlorine system.  The\nfollowing courses are administered to all employees and refreshed yearly:\n\n     General Safety Training\n     DEC Wastewater Operator Renewal Training\n     Hazard Communication Training"

The calculated distance to endpoint is 1.3 miles.\n\n       The alternate release scenario for the chlorine injection system is one that is more likely\nto occur than the worst case scenario that reaches an end point off-site.  A chlorine leak caused\nby piping or valve failure is used in the alternative scenario.  A hole diameter of 1/4 inch on the\npiping or valve could theoretically occur.  The release rate for this scenario is 9 pounds per\nminute for 222.2 minutes.  The meteorological conditions were atmospheric stability class of \"D\"\nand a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second.  The topography is urban.  Again the toxic endpoint\nis 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  The calculated distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.10\nmiles.  Methodology for determining distance to endpoints was done by referencing Risk\nManagement Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68). \n\n     The chemical of concern at the West Side Wastewater Treatment Plant is chlorine. \nChlorine can be toxic if not handled properly, however, the City of Oswego has a reasonable\nprogram in place to minimize the potential risks to a chlorine gas release.  A training program\ncombined with required recordkeeping, administrative controls, an effective emergency\nmanagement program, a local HazMat team, and an alarm system all address and meet the needs\nof the applicable regulations as defined under 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119.  The West Side\nWastewater Treatment Plant is currently evaluating improvements to their safety program.  They\nare investigating expanding the area that the chlorine sensors monitor along with visual, as well\nas audio alarms.  They are also taking this opportunity to improve and expand their training\nprograms, to make their employees further aware of the continued necessity for the safe use of\nchlorine."
