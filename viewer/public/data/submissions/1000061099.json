      "SummaryText": "The City of Navasota, Texas has two facilities that use chlorine gas in the amounts that require a Risk Management Plan in order to be in compliance with the Clean Air Act, One of these is the City wastewater treatment plant and the other is the domestic water facility. These two facilities are located approxametely a mile apart, and are treated as two separate processes. The process for handling chlorine containers is the same at each location.\n\n\n\nAt each location, chlorine gas from one-ton caontainers is added to the water/wastewater system. There are three one-ton containers at each site. Chlorine is dispensed from only one container at a time. The supply is automatically switched when a container becomes empty.\n\n\n\nWhen a container is emptied, a full, replacement container is ordered. This is offloaded from the vendors delivery truck with a hoist operating from a monorail. The container is placed on a designated support where it remains until it is empty and is loaded onto the vendors' delivery truck. \n\n\n\nThere are two full time employees that are responsible for daily inspections of these two sites.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE:\n\n\n\nAccidental release preventions is accomplished by careful attention to unloading containers, installing regulators, and connecting to the injection system. The emergency response will be repair (or contact vendor for repair) any source of release, alert the local emergency response teams, and evacuate adjacent local receptors as required.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nThe safety procedures in force at the sites are working as demonstrated by the fact there has been no release of chlorine at either site within the last five years."
