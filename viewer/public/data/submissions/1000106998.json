Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. The facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Stagecoach Volunteer Fire Department to respond to chemical releases.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nSince the site is a new process, it is continually ensuring the implementation of the prevention program, including the closure of the most recent PHA recommendations.\n\nThe facility has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nThe facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nThe facility promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nThe facility believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort.

This commitment is demonstrated by our accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. This site is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe facility receives Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) in tube trailers routinely, which is then unloaded into the process to be heated and filtered prior to injection into the customer\u2019s pipeline. The RNG contains methane, which is a flammable RMP-regulated chemical. At times, RNG is present at the facility in quantities above the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. There are no RMP-regulated toxic chemicals on site.\n\nThe site does not have full time operators on site; the operators only go to the site to  complete regular maintenance and operations when they receive biogas.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe facility has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.
