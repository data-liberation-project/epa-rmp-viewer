      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nValley Meat has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Valley MeatA?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe ammonia systems are composed of the following key components:\nA?    3 Reciprocating Compressors\nA?    2 Screw Compressors\nA?    3 Freezer Vessels\nA?    3 Blast Freezer Vessels\nA?    1 Intercooler\nA?    1 Plate Heat Exchanger\nA?    1 Auto Purger\nA?    1 High Pressure Receiver\nA?    1 Low Pressure Receiver\nA?    3 Oil Separators\nA?    2 Oil Pots\nA?    21 Evaporators\nA?    1 Diffusion Tank\nA?    1 Transfer Vessel\n\nSystem operation cycle begins at the high-pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the receiver to the pump receiver.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then pumped to the evaporators where it absorbs heat from the room. Vapor is returned to the pump receiver and accumulator from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid and liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver via the liquid ammonia transfer system. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP/EPA RMP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for the ammonia refrigeration process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation "

      "SummaryText": "located in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for the ammonia refrigeration process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Valley Meat has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\nA?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\nA?    Floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for offsite impact.\nA?    Although most of the ammonia is located in the Engine Room. Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\nA?    Plant personnel, as necessary, use personal Protective Equipment (PPE).\nA?    The history of the Facility (i.e., no EPA-applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\nACCIDENTAL REL"

Prevention Program 3 elements can be found in the Compliance Workbook.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of ammonia at the facility in at least the past five years.  \n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST-CASE \nThe use of flammable materials at Valley Meat facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe use of flammable materials at Valley Meat facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nValley Meat has implemented an Emergency Action Plan and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency.  Valley Meat has filed a Hazardous Materials Inventory (HMI) with the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources and this plan includes:\nA?    Emergency Alarm Procedures\nA?    Evacuation Procedures\nA?    Safety and Health Considerations\nA?    Notification Procedures\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nValley Meat is extremely diligent in the handling of ammonia.
