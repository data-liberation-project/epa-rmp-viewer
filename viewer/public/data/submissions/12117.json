Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA.  Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nSafety at our facility is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations stipulated by it.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with Emergency Response provisions.  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.  This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20 Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\n* Reser's Fine Foods, Inc. is a food manufacturing facility that stores and distributes refrigerated foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\n* The regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n* The ammonia refrigeration system maximum inventory is 17,512 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

Offsite receptors were defined using the Landview III (version 1.0) system.  This system estimates residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  In addition, it lists whether certain types of public receptors and environmental receptors are within the circles.\n\n* Worst Case Scenario.  Catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver located on the NE outside corner of the building when filled to the greatest amount would release 5,510 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario presumes that the entire contents are released.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.9 miles from the point of release.  The distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass a population of zero (based on 1990 US Census data).   Public receptors now located within this zone include residences, schools, correctional facility, recreational area, and an interstate freeway.  No environmental receptors are located in this zone.  Current census data is unavailable.  A release map corresponding to this scenario is located in Section 3.30.  Census data was derived using the LandView III (version 1.0).\n\nThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g. earthquake) physically compromised the tank.  The structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation.  The tank is also safeguarded from rupture due to over-pressurization.  It is a pressure-rated vessel hydro-tested to 375"

The design specification of the tank only allows maximum capacity of 80% at 80(, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system.  During high demand, the High Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a fraction (~30%) of capacity.\n\n\n\n\n* Alternative Scenario.  Several alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  These scenarios presume a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 5,510 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 0.2 miles from the point of release.  The distance extends beyond the facility fence line and would encompass a population of 0 (based on 1990 US Census data).  Public receptors now located within this zone include a recreational area, an interstate freeway, and residences.   No environmental receptors are located in this zone.  A release map corresponding to this scenario is located in Section 3.30. Census data was derived using the LandView III (version 1.0).\n\nThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety systems provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than 10 minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.\n\n1.40  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nReser's Fine Foods, Inc. complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
