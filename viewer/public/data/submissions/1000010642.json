The operations of the Hershey Creamery Company shall be conducted with the highest regard for the safety and health of its employees.  It is therefore reasonable to expect every employee to accept the responsibility of being a conscious safe worker and to commonly practice safe work habits while on the job and work place. Thus to accomplish this mission, and a successful safety program, with the active cooperation of every person/employee is absolutely essential.\n\nAll employees are part takers of this team effort with the Hershey Creamery Company, Inc..  For a team to operate efficiently, it must be structured and disciplined, following the leadership guidance of the management leadership, while working together, safely, towards a common goal. Each team member must be responsible for their own actions and should constantly exercise care and good judgment on the job and at the work place.  Every employee regardless of job reasonability and/or job description is to adopt a \"think before you act\" safety prospective. Because an unconscious action or act could cause a mortality to yourself or others.\n\nIn order to accomplish the above safety goals the Hershey Creamery Company has implemented a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) for its Ammonia Refrigeration Process.  The PSM Plan includes both an Emergency Action Plan and an Integrated Contingency Plan.  The objective of the PSM Plan is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals that could expose employees and other to serious hazards.  To control these types of hazards, our PSM Team have developed and implemented a proactive initiative within our workforce that maintains the program as envisioned by OSHA.\n\nOver the pase five years we have had no reportable releases of ammonia, however, some non-reportable releases have been handled by our inhouse"
