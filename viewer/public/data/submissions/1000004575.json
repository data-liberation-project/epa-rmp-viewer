      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\nAt Surpass Chemical Company's Bridge Street facility we handle chlorine, which is considered hazardous by EPA. Chlorine at our facility is used to manufacture liquid sodium hypochlorite bleach and is consumed directly from the rail tank car. Hypochlorite bleach is well known as an easier to use and safer to handle form of chlorine. It is widely used for disinfecting municipal and private water supplies, for household laundry bleach and for many other commercial uses. The same germicidal and highly reactive properties that make chlorine, and other products made from it, so valuable as a commodity and important to public health, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions. Chlorine safety depends upon the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we follow, and the training of our personnel. Safe handling of chlorine is necessary to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community. It is our policy to handle chlorine safely and to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations governing its handling and use. \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\nThe primary purpose of Surpass Chemical's Bridge Street facility is to manufacture, blend, package and distribute chemicals to water treatment facilities and general industry. The regulated substance handled at this manufacturing/distribution facility is chlorine.  The maximum total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 360,000 pounds. Norma"

Chlorine is received on site in rail tank cars and is used as a raw material in the manufacture of liquid sodium hypochlorite bleach. This facility has equipment for the safe unloading of rail tank cars into the liquid sodium hypochlorite bleach process. \n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario;\n \nWorst-Case Scenario - Worst case scenario population effectd calculation was done by using the US Census Website. Populations from the counties / communities potentially involved was obtained from 2008 census data from this website.

Access to the site is restricted to authorized employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The sodium Hypochlorite manufactured at this facility is an EPA registered pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and has UL Approval. This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute.\nOur PSM was"

Documentation of this training is filed in our training records. \n\n5. Five-year accident history\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based upon the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities. We have discussed this program with the County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City Fire Department. Representatives of the City of Albany Department of Fire and Emergency Services toured the facility in October 2003. Members of the Fire Department Hazardous Materials Unit were trained in joint exercises on the installation of an Emergency \"C\" Kit on a chlorine tank car simulator provided by Surpass in a simulation drill conducted in 2006. \nAn Incident Response Team has been created and training is ongoing.Objective is to have a group of employees trained to respond to any minor spill or situation that may occur at Surpass. We would not respond to any off site incidents. \n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nA Powell Continuous Bleach manufacturing system was completed in April of 2005. A Chlorine scrubber system was installed to evacuate the entire piping systems as well as all new process controls including additional chlorine detectors.  "
