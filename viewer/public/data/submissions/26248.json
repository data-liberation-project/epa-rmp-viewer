Sulfur Dioxide is also used in the treatment of water.  The same properties that make these chemicals valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling them to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community as well as to the employees of the company.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBrenntag Southwest owns emergency equipment specifically designed to be able to stop leaks from containers of these products.  This equipment includes Chlorine Institute approved A and B kits for cylinders and ton containers, and a cylinder recovery vessel.  Brenntag maintains employees who are trained in the specialized use of this emergency equipment and also maintains agreements with area response companies who are equipped with their own kits.  \n\nThe Emergency Programs in place at the facility include an Emergency Action Plan, Fire Prevention Plan, Emergency Response Plan, and a Transportation Emergency Plan.  These plans require the facility to maintain an open door policy with local fire departments and other emergency groups in the area, and to invite emergency responders from both the public and private sectors to tour the facility annually in order to gain knowledge of the physical setup of the plant.  This information becomes very valuable during an emergency incident.  These plans also direct the facility to maintain a working relationship with area clinics and hospitals in order to be prepared during emergency events of any kind.   \n\nWORST CASE & ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe EPA was required by law to define the Worst Case Scenario (WCS), as an unlikely event: the largest single storage v"

In the history of the company no event of this magnitude has ever occurred, but under this law, the facility does have off-site consequences to the public and the environment. \n\nThe EPA calls a more likely incident, many of which will have limited or no off-site consequences, an Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  An ARS for this facility could be a minor leak from a cylinder or container.  For the facility the ARS will have off-site consequences, but would be limited to an area in close proximity to the plant.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nBrenntag Southwest, Inc., maintains Health, Safety and Environmental policies for Risk Management, Training, Product Stewardship, Community Outreach, Hazard Communication, and Process Safety Management among others.  These policies require careful review of the hazards and the safeguards that must be implemented to prevent releases of regulated chemicals. Along with these programs, the company implements the knowledge gained from being a long-term member of The Chlorine Institute. The Institute establishes written pamphlets, and videos among other information to guide facilities in prevention and emergency programs that cover issues such as processing, handling, storage, and releases of chemicals such as Chlorine.  Coupled with the numerous training programs from the Institute, the company also complies with container specifications, inspections, and testing requirements of laws in-acted by the Department of Transportation.  Still other programs such as the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process, and guidance implemented based on EPA's SARA Title III regulations along with BOCA Building and Fire Codes have aided the company in designing and operating a safe plant.  These programs and regulations in conjunction with company policy help to ensure that the possibility of a release of this magnitude would never occur at the facility."

      "SummaryText": "FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\nThe Brenntag Southwest Shreveport branch has never experienced a release of any magnitude that caused the facility to implement evacuation measures. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has emergency plans, which are coordinated with local fire departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Our response plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is based upon the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  For other products, the plans are based off of information from the manufacturers of these materials. The emergency response plans for all company facilities include procedures for notification of any potentially affected neighbors, the local fire authority, and federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn order to continue to improve upon its safety record, Brenntag Southwest requires all of its facilities to conduct incident investigations, safety compliance audits, continuous training of normal, and emergency procedures, and continuous community outreach actions which include: educating and training neighbors, customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  These policies coupled with improvements that have originated from internal programs such as the Employee Suggestion Program and from external sources such as industrial associations like the Chlorine Institute aids the company in its continuous effort to enhance the safe handling and storage of compressed liquefied gases."
