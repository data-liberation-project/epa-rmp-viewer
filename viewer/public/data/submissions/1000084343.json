Should a release or emergency occur, Chemline has developed a thorough Emergency Action and Contingency Plan (EACP) as well as coordination with outside agencies, such as the St. Louis City Fire Department, to ensure there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAt this location, Chemline manufactures and produces polyurethane and polyurea coatings as well as rigid and flexible polyurethane foams.  The NAICS code for the primary process at the facility is 325510.\r\n\r\nChemline has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68:  toluene diisocyanate (CAS No. 26471-62-5) contained in various raw materials.  TDI is used as a reactant in the production of the coatings and foams.\r\n\r\nThe TDI threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of TDI stored on-site is approximately 60,000 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Chemline plant in St. Louis, MO.\r\n\r\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nChemline is not subject to the OSHA PSM program for their TDI or other chemical systems.  At Chemline, TDI falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the TDI prevention program that are key:\r\n\r\n1. \tOnly small amounts of TDI are maintained in the production area, reducing the amount of TDI that could be released at any given time due to improper handling or accidents.\r\n2. \tThe plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe review of the facility's accident history includes the following range of dates:  November 26, 2014 - November 26 2019. According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no ac"

The plan includes key management personnel and their roles along with critical phone numbers.  Each type of emergency identified lists actions to be taken along with evacuation procedures.  The St. Louis City Fire Department will be contacted as needed.  If an ambulance is called, the fire department will also respond.\r\n\r\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe facility plans to store the TDI in several locations, thus reducing the amount of material at risk at any given time for an accident.  The installation of a new flammable room within an existing building to hold flammable materials is being considered for future development at the site."
