      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nR.M.E., Inc. is a leading producer of fine wines from around the world. The company has instituted many safety-related programs to ensure safe operations throughout the facilities. This includes ensuring compliance with various industry standards and the Process Safety Management / Risk Management Programs for their ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Woodbridge Winery has been in operation since 1978.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  The facility is located at 5950 Woodbridge Road, Acampo, California 95220.  In March 2003, a new plant was constructed (Plant 3) for a total of three plants  at the facility.\n\nIn Plant 1 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to two high pressure receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is again transferred from HPRs to two low pressure recirculators (LPR-1 and LPR-2) and the wine chillers.  Associated with LPR-1 is a liquid transfer vessel (LTV) where excess liquid ammonia can be routed back to the HPRs.  Pumped liquid is sent to wine chillers and jacketed tanks.  The second low pressure recirculator (LPR-2) pumps low pressure ammonia to the remaining jacketed tanks.  The vapor generated from the heat transfer from the process equipment (chillers and jacketed tanks) is returned to each accumulator, respectively in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from the accumulators is then pulled to the compressors (4) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (5) w"

The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the two FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  A portable auto purger is used to remove non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The purger is mounted on a portable rack and can be used at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  As the pressure in the process increases, the purger is connected and left to run for approximately one week to remove any non-condensibles.  The process also has a fire dump box/control box which can be used in only an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually reduce the system pressure.\n\nIn Plant 2 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to a high pressure receiver (HPR).  Liquid is transferred from HPR to wine chillers (21) and glycol chillers (4).  Vapor from the chillers is returned to two suction accumulators both equipped with a liquid transfer vessel.  Liquid from the accumulators is routed back to the HPR, whereas, the vapor from the accumulators is pulled to the compressors (7) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at the Woodbridge Winery in the last five years (February 2003 to February 2008). \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEffective 1/1/2007, Woodbridge Winery adopted a defensive approach and implemented an Emergency Action Plan based on a 300 ppm concentration level. If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency based a number of factors, including but not limited to life safety concerns, the concentration level and amount of the ammonia release, and the ability of the facility to safely and effectively manage the release. The facility is trained and prepared to independently manage a release with concentration levels of less than 300 ppm. A release above 300 ppm would require the assistance of outside emergency services. With any significant ammonia release triggering emergency action, Woodbridge Winery will notify all potentially affected employees, visitors, contractors, and neighbors of the release and direct them to shelter in place or evacuate to designated meeting areas. Plant management (or designee) will notify 911, San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, and the National and State Release Reporting Centers (if the release quantities exceed thresholds) .

This Emergency Action Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has reviewed and revalidated the initial Process Hazard Analysis report and outlined additional measures that would further improve the safety of the facility. In addition, a complete PSM/RMP compliance audit was conducted in February 2006 which also led to program improvements. Some of these include the following:\n\n1. Updates to the PSM / RMP documentation to incorporate policies and procedures in place by the new owner.\n2. Updates to the Process Safety Information to incorporate new ammonia delivery information.\n3. Review Emergency Response capabilities and update training requirements for operators."
