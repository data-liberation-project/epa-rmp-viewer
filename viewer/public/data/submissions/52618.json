This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  The Samson policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSamson operates the Gordo Facility located in Pickens County, Alabama.  Gordo is a natural gas processing plant that produces natural gas liquids (NGL) by refrigeration unit with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The NGL, a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and C6+ compounds, is stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation by truck.  Condensate is also stored in a tank for transportation from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Gordo is a Program 2 RMP process.\n\nOperations at the Gordo Facility were evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Gordo Facility has not had any accidental releases in the past five years that meet the criteria of an accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE "

      "SummaryText": "PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Gordo Facility:  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSamson actively encourages all employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.   This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining RMP rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  \n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nGordo maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.    \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\nHazard Review and Analysis\n\nGordo has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nGordo primarily uses the ?What-if? method to perform these evaluations.  The Hazard Review is conducted by persons knowledgeable about the process.  Based on the answers to the questions, consequences and preliminary recommendations can be determined.\n\nThe Hazard Review findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  Samson assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation include"

      "SummaryText": "s the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   All Hazard Review findings are communicated with Samson employees and contractors that may be affected. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nGordo maintains written procedures that address normal startup and shutdown for several pieces of equipment.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed to verify that they are current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary. \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, Gordo has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations. Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards. Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSamson is establishing programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable material is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee?s job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.  Process equipment inspection follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits will be corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure s"

An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  This investigation is led by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process.  The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \n\nEmergency Planning and Response\n\nEmergency Response activities for Gordo are coordinated with the local fire department.  In the case of an accidental release, the Samson employee will activate the emergency shutdown system if possible and evacuate upwind of the release.  They will immediately notify the local fire department who will then respond to the emergency.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Samson will periodically conduct an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and practices.  The audit team will develop findings and corrective actions which will be tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding will be documented, and the two most recent audit reports shall be retained.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSamson is committed to operating Gordo in a safe manner for workers, the public, and the environment.  Samson will conduct compliance audits and hazard reviews as require"
