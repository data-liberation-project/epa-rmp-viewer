Should an accidental release occur, our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility information.\n\n     The primary activities at our facility is the srorage of anhydrous ammonia to be resold as nitrogen fertilizer for crop production.\n     Our anhydrous ammonia storage tank and plant is located 1 mile South of the city of Canby, Mn on Hwy 75.\n     At this location we have storage for 55,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia which is delivered by tanker truck and stored in one 26,000 gallon storage tank and distributed to farmers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia in storage would be 257,000 pounds in nurse tanks and main storage tank.\n\nThe worst case release scenario.\n\n     The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 26,000 gallon storage tank of anhydrous ammonia in 10 minutes time with maximum quantity released being 114,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.09 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario.\n\n     The alternate release scenario is based on a most likely potential incident in which a release from a break in a three inck line with a duration of two minutes. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .78 miles.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program.\n\n     This facility has implemented the rules and provisions of Minnesota Code of Agency Rules, Storage and Handling"
