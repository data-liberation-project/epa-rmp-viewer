The accidental release prevention policy at the Allegheny Valley\n\nJoint Sewage Authority treatment facility involves a combined effort\n\nbetween management, operating and local emergency personnel.  The\n\nfacility has an ongoing effort to identify hazards, review safety\n\ntechniques and implement employee training through operation,\n\nmaintenance and inspection procedures to manage the risk of a chlorine\n\ngas release.\n\n\n\nB.    The Allegheny Valley Joint Sewage Authority treatment facility was\n\noriginally placed    into operation in 1961.  The facility was expanded\n\nboth in 1980 and 1993.  The facility currently has the capacity of\n\ntreating 5.5 million gallons per day of wastewater.  Gaseous chlorine,\n\nwhich is stored in a separate room, is utilized to disinfect the\n\neffluent prior to discharging to the receiving water.  The amount of\n\nchlorine handled is three one-ton containers for a total of 6,000\n\npounds.  The chlorine gas feeders are cylinder-mounted and are\n\ndesigned for conveying the gas under vacuum.  The chlorine system is\n\ninspected    daily by the wastewater treatment plant operating\n\npersonnel.  The facility is manned approximately 18 hours per day.\n\n\n\nC.    In general, the Allegheny Valley Wastewater Treatment Facility's\n\naccidental release prevention program is based on the following:\n\n    \n\n    - Compilation of safety information for chlorine storage\n\n    - Review of potential on-site hazards of the chlorine process\n\n    - Preparation of written operating procedures for safely\n\n      conducting any activity involving the chlorination process\n\n    - Implementation of employee training program\n\n    - Preparation of written maintenance and inspection techniques\n\n      and schedule for safe operation of the chlorine system\n\n\n\n    As an integral part of the prevention program, the Allegheny\n\nValley Joint Sewage Authority will perform a compliance audit at least\n\nonce every 3 years"

      "SummaryText": ".  The compliance audit will include a review of all\n\naspects of the risk management program in conjunction with corrective\n\nactions if any deficiencies exist.  Written documentation of the audit\n\nwill be maintained on-site.\n\n\n\n    Any incident that results in, or could have resulted in, a\n\ncatastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated immediately.  A\n\nsummary of the investigation and corrective actions will be documented\n\nand maintained at the treatment facility.\n\n\n\n    Chemical-specific prevention measures include the facility having\n\nthe appropriate safety equipment on-site including a chlorine detection\n\ndevice, self-contained breathing apparatuses and a ton-cylinder repair\n\nkit.  The facility promotes training and educating the employees\n\nrelative to acceptable operating and handling techniques of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nE.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility\n\nin the past five years.\n\n\n\nF.    The facility is included under the Local Emergency Planning\n\nCommittee (LEPC) of Allegheny County's written emergency response plan.\n\nRelease response procedures by all involved parties, evacuation\n\nprocedures and training exercises are included within the    plan.  The\n\npublic is to be notified by the County Emergency Management Agency as\n\nsoon as a release occurs.  Evacuation route has been mapped within\n\nthe plan.  The plan is reviewed/updated annually by the facility\n\nemergency coordinator.\n\n\n\n    The Allegheny Valley WWTP employees will not respond to accidental\n\nreleases of    chlorine gas.  Emergency responders will include the local\n\nfire department, police    department, emergency medical service and\n\nHAZMAT team.\n\n\n\nG.    There are no actions planned to improve safety regarding the\n\nchlorine system at this time.\n\n"
