Both incidents involved a release of chlorine and are included in the accident history section of the RMP.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility operates under a credo of continuous improvement in every aspect of operation. This is exhibited through numerous facility iimprovement projects which are either in-progress, approved or in the evaluation/planning phases.

The weak liquor is sent to the evaporator train to remove most of the salt and concentrate the caustic to 50% prior to being sent to storage tanks.  The caustic solution is then shipped off-site as a product to customers via barges, trucks, rail cars, ships, and pipeline.\n\nThe unit receives crude salt brine from off-site via a pipeline.  The brine is purified to remove calcium and magnesium.  The brine is then saturated with sodium chloride salt from the evaporators before being fed to the cells.  The electrolytic cells are located in two large cell  rooms in which direct electrical current is used to produce chlorine gas at the stable anode.  Ionized brine migrates through a permeable asbestos diaphragm to the cathode where hydrogen gas is produced.  The remaining liquid is a weak liquor consisting of 12% caustic soda and 16% salt solution.  The weak liquor is either drawn off and stored, or fed directly to the evaporators.\n\nChlorine gas is introduced into coolers to remove moisture.  The gas is then sent through a wet brinks mist eliminator to remove residual water.  Additional water is removed by passing the chlorine gas through sulfuric acid drying towers.  The residual acid is used for pH neutralization at the caustic plant's water treatment system.  Sulfuric acid mist is removed by a dry brinks mist eliminator.  The chlorine gas is then fed to a scrubber to be cooled and remove impurities.  After  final filtration, the cold chlorine gas is compressed to 100 - 150 psig.  The compressed gas is then partially liquefied in exchangers with the remaining gas being sent via a pipeline to the EDC plant.  Liquid chlorine is stored in two tanks until needed for the scrubber. \n\nThe weak liquor is fed to triple effect evaporators where the caustic content is increased to 50% through removal of water.

Gaseous ethylene and chlorine gases are received via pipeline, and are sparged into liquid EDC in a vertical, open pipe reactor.  The heat of the reaction is removed by a vertical heat exchanger.  Circulation is provided by a thermosiphon effect resulting from the differences in the liquid density of the two sections.  Produced EDC is removed via an overflow line to a wash train, where neutralization occurs, and impurities are removed.  \n\nThe water which is used to remove the impurities is sent via hard pipe to the EDC/VCM I unit wastewater treatment system.  Emissions from the reactors consisting of inert gases, unreacted ethylene, and EDC vapors are piped to the plant's incineration system, where hydrocarbons are destroyed and chlorine is recovered as hydrochloric acid (HCl).  \n\nPure EDC is fed to the natural gas fired cracking furnaces.  About 50% of the EDC is cracked to VCM and HCl.  Furnace product output is partially condensed in quench columns.  The quench effluent passes to the HCl column where pure HCl is removed at the column overhead, and is later fed to the oxychlorination reactor.  EDC and VCM from the bottom of the column is fed to the vinyl column.  VCM from the overhead of this column then goes to HCl scrubbers and a drying tower for final polishing.  VCM is stored in pressure spheres before being sent to the PVC plant.  EDC from the bottom is fed to the EDC purification train.  The HCl and VCM columns normally do not vent.

Reaction gases pass through a recovery section where crude EDC is condensed and sent to storage tanks prior to purification.   The water is returned to the hot quench where EDC is stripped before the process wastewater is sent to the biological wastewater treatment plant.  Unreacted gases are piped to the unit's incinerators.   One incineration unit is capable of incinerating at a rate of 60 MMBtu/hr, and the other on at a rate of 48 MMBtu/hr.  This system is designed to oxidize the organic components from the vents from the closed process streams, cool the products of combustion in a waste heat recovery boiler, and remove and neutralize the HCl formed during the combustion process. \n\nTraditional distillation columns, with reboilers and reflux condensers, are used to remove impurities from recycle and oxychlorination reactor EDC.

The plant currently produces six grades of suspension PVC, with the ability to manufacture three grades at once.  \n\nThe PVC polymerization reactors consist of  large jacketed vessels with agitators, reflux condensers and related equipment.  The production of a single batch of PVC consists of mixing measured quantities of water (for ease of material transport and better product quality), suspending agents (to allow the water and PVC to form a uniform mixture), other chemical additives (for better product quality), and VCM (the raw material).  After these ingredients are mixed, an initiator is added to start the polymerization reaction.  The polymerization reaction is exothermic.  The reaction process is cooled to maintain a desired process temperature. Once 80 to 90% of the VCM is reacted, the reaction is stopped through the addition of an inhibitor chemical.

      "SummaryText": "ripping, the PVC slurry contains less than permitted 35 ppm VCM.  The stripped VCM is vented to a gas holder to be purified for reuse. \n\nThe PVC slurry is pumped through coolers to dryer feed the holding tanks. The PVC slurry is then pumped from the dryer to centrifuges where the slurry is separated into PVC wet cake and water.  The water is pumped to the biological wastewater treatment plant for treatment.  The PVC wet cake is fed into the dryers with a vibrating feeder. The dryer are either cyclone dryers or a fluidized bed dryer.  PVC powder and air are separated by cyclone separators.  The air vented from the tops of the cyclone dryers is passed through a water scrubber.  The PVC powder is collected and sent to sieves, separating out the good product.  The PVC product is then transferred by pneumatic air conveying system to silos for storage and loading operations.  Each silo has vent that is controlled by bag filter air cleaning devices.\n\nThe unreacted VCM which is recovered from the PVC reactors, blowdown tanks, and VCM steam stripping columns is compressed by liquid ring compressors.  The compressed gas is piped to a triple set of condensers.  The condensed crude VCM and water are separated in a decanter.  The decanted water is piped to the PVC waste water stripping column area for purification. The condensible gases are vented to the VCM I or VCM II incinerators.  \n\nThe waste water system in the PVC unit consists of hard pipe to transport the VCM contaminated water, two storage tanks, and two waste water steam strippers.  The water is pumped to the waste water storage, then steam stripped of VCM, and sent to the Bio-plant to treat the unstrippable TOC.  The control point is 0.2 ppm for VCM.  The over head of the steam stripper goes through a condenser and the non-condensable gases go to the VCM I or VCM II incinerator.  The VCM from the recovery condensers is returned  to the wet VCM storage."
