      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n A.  Describe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nAtlas is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation and compliance. This manager is committed to maintaining the safety of the RMP covered ammonia system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes. While this manager carries out the mechanics of the RMP requirement, the authority for such activities comes from the Executive VP of Atlas. To insure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and inspections will be conducted as required by RMP. Updates to the RMP will be completed as necessary in response to these activities. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Atlas Cold Storage facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product is stored in frozen, refrigerated, or dry storage warehouse and then loaded and distributed by tractor trailer to various customers.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory is based on two separate ammonia systems on this property with total inventory of approximately 19,100 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and processing of perishable food products.  Through the use of two stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25f. and +20F.\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the V1-1 or V1-2 Receiver. A worst-case release from this vessel includes an estimated 2,704 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a 0.525 or 0.42 inch circular hole located at the bottom of the vessel V1-1 or V1-2, respectively.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is 0.62 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n  The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\n  Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these vessels;\n\n  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n  Pressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels and"

      "SummaryText": " vessels have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is chosen as a pipe failure.  The potential for a pipe failure is possible given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility and, as such, represents a more realistic event than the catastrophic failure of a vessel.\n\nAssumed is the failure of a 1-inch pipe connected to the V1-2 Receiver.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is 0.13 miles.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n  The high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n\n  Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n  Vessel design uses a factor of approximately 4 to 1 margin for safety.\n\n  Active mitigation would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits the system to equalize to 50-60 psig.\n\nD.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program (OSHA Process Safety Management CFR 1910.119) consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTrainingContractors\nPre-startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity\nHot Work Permit\nManagement of Change\nIncident Investigation\nCompliance Audits\n\nE.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents in the past five years.\n\nF.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility will call in local emergency personnel in the event of a significant ammonia release.  The facility is included in the community Emergency Response Program coordinated by the Hennepin County Emergency Management (763-745-7620).\n\nG.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducte"
