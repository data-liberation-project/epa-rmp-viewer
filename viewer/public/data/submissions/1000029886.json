The ammonia system provides refrigeration capacity to nine (9) storage rooms, three (3) precool rooms, several hallway units, and a hydrocooler.\r\n\r\nThe pumped overfeed system for the all the rooms and hallway units operate as follows:  high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of two liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each degreening room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to two screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrocooler utilizes flooded system. The flooded portion of the system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to the hydrocooler where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.

The suction line returns the vapor to the liquid recirculator located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas. The gas is piped to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Lastly, the system has an emergency dump box that contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n  \r\nThe ammonia systems at consist of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, each system is treated as a single process.\r\n \r\nSun World International also has two sulfur-dioxide (SO2) storage area where cylinders of SO2 are stored before use in fumigating rooms.  All controls and monitoring operations are done manually.\r\n\r\nThe systems operate as follows.  Cylinders ranging from 1 lb to 50 lbs capacities are kept on site.  They are stored in racks and bins specially designed to keep them secured.  When a room requires fumigation the operator calculates the exact amount of SO2 requir"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nSun World International has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \r\n\r\n1.3.2\tANHYDROUS AMMONIA\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun World International facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sun World International continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun World International's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun World International's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSun World International has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sun World International has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. A copy of Resource Compliance's service agreement has been included in this program with the support material.\r\n\r\nFor the"
