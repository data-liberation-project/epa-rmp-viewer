The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training  associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is the Belton-Honea Path Water Authority's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Belton-Honea Path Water Treatment Plant has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine with a threshold quantity of 2,500 lb.  Chlorine is used in the Water treatment process at the facility.The Belton-Honea Path Water Authority is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \r\nThe Belton-Honea Path Water Authority has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is already in compliance.  The following steps are key to the prevention program:\r\n1. Detailed records of safety information describing the chemical hazards of chlorine, process technology, and process equipment.\r\n2. Comprehensive process hazard analysis are conducted to ensure that hazards are recognized and evaluate"
