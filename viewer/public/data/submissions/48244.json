The Facility Policy for Haubstadt Branch\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Superior Ag Resources are committed to prevention and accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities. To mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nB.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nC. The maximum quantity stored at  our facilities would be 268940 LBS in our storage tanks.  The largest of which is 30,000 gallons.  The maximum quantity handled at any given time would be the unloading of SEMI TANKER TRUCK HOLDING @ 9000 GALLONS\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\nA. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 1 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 144075, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 2 miles.\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is .1 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K41.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health"

This facility has also complied with the Ammonia Law regulated by the Office of the State Chemist.\n\n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nThere has been NO RELEASE or injuries in the past five years that have cause significant damage or injury.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910 38;\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nc. A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
