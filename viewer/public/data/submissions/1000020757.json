It is the policy of the Utilities Division to operate all of the facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most efficient manner possible with due regard for the health and safety of Utilities Division employees, the Public, and our environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\n\nThe Water Filtration Plant employs chlorine as a disinfectant for the surface water supply of the City of Cumberland, Maryland.  The chlorine is the delivered, stored, and drawn from one-ton containers.  The ton containers are stoed in a dedicated Chlorination Building.  This is considered to be a single, continuous process.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nFor the Water Filtration Plant, a worst case assumed an accidental release of wo tons of chlorine during 10 minutes at 0 feet elevation and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with an atmospheric stability class F.\n\nThe Alternative scenario for the facility assumes a break in the gass withdrawal tubing at a ton container conection, a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit(the maximum temperature, at the closest reporting station), and an atmospheric stability class of D.  Procedures that prohibit lifting containers over in-service containers and having only one container actively in use at a time, reduces the likelihood of breaking multiple lines and having multi-ton releases.\n\nRelease Prevention\n\nThe general release prevention program is based on training, standard operating procedures, and material selection.  The operating personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenace, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Water Filtration Plant."

The sytems are regularly and routinely inspected, and maintenance or replacement is performed as appropriate.\n\nAccident History\n\nTo date, there have been no accidental chlorine, ammonia or propane releases from the Water Filtration Plant resulting in either on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on the use of Utitilies Division WFP employees who are trained to respond to, and control, and accidental release of chlorine.  The employees are trained in the use of Personal Protective Equipment and specialized ton-container patching kits (Chlorine Institute Kit B)."
