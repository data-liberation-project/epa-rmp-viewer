      "SummaryText": "City of Saginaw Water Treatment Plant Executive Summary\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant provides high quality safe drinking water, which meets all State and Federal drinking water requirements to the residents of Saginaw County and surrounding areas.  Chlorine gas is used in the treatment process to disinfect drinking water.  Disinfection protects customers from contracting water-borne diseases and is required by the Federal and State Safe Drinking Water Acts as amended.  \n\nChlorine gas is stored on site in the form of one-ton cylinders.  Typically, a maximum of ten cylinders are on site, of which four are connected and available for use at any time.  Water Treatment Plant staff and the Saginaw Fire Department are trained to react to accidental releases of chlorine gas.  Written procedures for the handling of chlorine are in place as well as periodic employee training on the hazards and safe handling of chlorine is conducted.\n\nAccident prevention is accomplished by adherence to written procedures, employee training, monitoring systems, and inspections.  Thirteen maintenance personnel receive A?AwarenessA? and A?OperationsA? level training.  The same thirteen maintenance employees are trained in the safe handling of chlorine gas from delivery to hook-up, the use of a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and the use of a repair kit for minor leaks.  All operations employees that use chlorine feed equipment are trained in the proper start-up and shut down procedures to prevent overpressure situations that could cause leaks.  All plant personnel receive hazardous materials training.  Non-affected personnel receive Awareness level training.  \n   \nIn addition to employee training, a chlorine leak detection system is used to continuously monitor for chlorine gas leaks in all areas where chlorine cylinders are stored and chlorine gas feed lines are located.  The sensors used will alarm above a set concentration of gas detected.  The alarms serve two functions.  The first of"

Each connected cylinder has an automatic shut off device that will close the flow of chlorine from all cylinders in use, in the event of chlorine gas being detected by the monitoring system.  The monitoring system is checked routinely to assure that all components are functioning correctly.  All plant personnel and contractors on site must respond to each alarm as written in the emergency response plan.  Contractors must go through an orientation session before working on site.  The hazards of chlorine and proper response to an alarm are covered in addition to other plant procedures.  Our piping and delivery systems are designed for use with chlorine gas and are inspected periodically as recommended by the manufacturer or using industry standards\n\nThe Saginaw Water Plant strives to improve the safety of the chlorine gas system.  Examples include:  1. Replacement of the chlorine feed lines in 2001.  2. Pigtails, located between the ton cylinders and the chlorine feed header valves were replaced with more structurally sound monel connecting lines in 2008.  3. Chlorine and ideas on how to improve our systems are regularly discussed at monthly safety meetings. 4. The chlorine system and processes are also discussed at routinely scheduled process safety committee meetings for process system review and improvement.  Staff involvement and input is highly encouraged and used in our routine process reviews.  Many of the methods and means of our safety and protection systems are included in our Process Safety Management Plan as required by Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act 154, of the P.A. of 1974 as amended, specifically, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Part 59, Rule 1910.  In addition we yearly submit information as required by sections 311 and 312, Title III if the "

The Saginaw Water Treatment Plant is required to list the five-year accident history.  There have been no reportable accidents or releases in the last five years.  \n\nThe Saginaw Water Treatment Plant works with local and county agencies to respond to chlorine emergencies and keep the community informed.  The Saginaw Fire Department has been trained to respond to chlorine emergencies at the Water Treatment Plant.  The Saginaw Fire Department also conducts the A?Hazardous MaterialsA? training of plant personnel.  Senior management have received A?National Incident ManagementA? training.  There has been an A?Emergency Operations PlanA? developed and is in place for the Water Treatment Plant.  The Saginaw County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) aids the Saginaw Water Treatment Plant in keeping the community aware of the types and quantities of chemicals used.  Senior management routinely attends planning sessions with the LEPC for community wide disaster scenarios.  The Water Treatment Plant periodically runs drills by activating the chlorine alarm and evaluating response of plant personnel.\n\nDue to safety and security concerns and the plants location relative to high population areas, the City of Saginaw Water Treatment Plant is in the process of replacing itA?s gaseous chlorine feed system with a liquid sodium hypochlorite feed system.  The new feed system is considered interim until further analyses can be made. These analyses are part of master planning studies being conducted in consultation with Greeley and Hansen Engineers.  Based on these studies recommendations will be made for permanent disinfection system replacement.  We expect, at this time, that the liquid feed system will be phased into use starting late fall to early winter 2009.  Due to an anticipated learning curve use of chlorine gas will be phased out over the following year.  We will however m"
