The Waukesha propane process receives product by propane transport truck that is stored onsite a bulk storage vessel (108,000 lbs / 30,000 gallons) before being transferred into gas cylinders then distributed to customers. Cylinders containing between 20 and 100 lbs of propane are filled on a daily basis. Each is weighed after filling, increasing operational safety.\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical:\r\nPropane stored and transferred on site is listed as a highly hazardous chemical under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. The Airgas Waukesha, WI onsite inventory of propane is in excess of 10,000 pounds making the propane process and its connected equipment a PSM/RMP covered process.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe highly flammable and hazardous nature of propane in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. Airgas' policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. This Executive Summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program. Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Mitigation - Emergency stop buttons to isolate propane sources; personal protective equipment (protective outerwear clothing, intrinsically safe devices, safety glasses, shoes, etc.) (2) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provides isolation for pr"

Employees are trained on and provided access to the propane process safety information. Specific actions an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely. Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these safe operating limits. The Safety Coordinator and Facility Managers are responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

Facility Manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (OP)\r\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous propane process operations, such as: (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal operations; (3) unit emergency shutdown; (4) unit normal shutdown and; (5) unit startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown. Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner. Operation under temporary or emergency procedures require and MOC, should the need arise. Airgas operating procedures have safe operating limits identified along with consequences of unsafe deviation. Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe deviation. Airgas procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nTraining (TN)\r\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the propane covered process.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5)\r\napplying quality assurance measures.
