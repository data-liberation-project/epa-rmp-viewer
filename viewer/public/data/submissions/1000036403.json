      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WEST UNION PLANT\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies - Dominion Transmission, Inc. (Dominion) West Union is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Dominion's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, employees control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Doddridge County emergency response (911) will be utilized for emergency response capability.  Dominion has also contracted Weavertown Environmental Group as an oil spill response organization to provide additional emergency response expertise. At least one operator staffs the facility during each 10-hr day shift.  The Dominion Hasting compressor station located nearby remotely monitors the operation of the West Union Extraction Plant continuously.\r\n \r\n2. Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances - Dominion owns and operates the West Union Plant located in Doddridge County, West Virginia.  The facility is a cryogenic turbo-expander plant that straddles a gas transmission line, owned by Equitrans.  The West Union Plant receives inlet gas at where it is scrubbed to remove free liquids in the gas, compressed and dehydrated utilizing two molecular sieve beds.  After dehydration, the gas is cooled then fractionated where liquids condense and fall to the bottom and the overhead gas is removed from the facility by pipeline.  The mixed NGL product (C2+) is sent to the product storage tanks for subsequent transport offsite.\r\nThe West Union Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Dominion identified NGLs, a flammable mixture to be present onsite.  The NG"

All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, Dominion maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  Safe work practices have been developed to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\r\nTraining - A training program is in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Initial employee training is provided and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Employee training is documented and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\r\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures.  Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper operation and maintenance.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping sy"

Thus, NGL product is also subject to the RMP requirements.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the West Union Plant is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the West Union Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - The facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at this facility.\r\nProcess Safety Information - Dominion maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes at the facility.  Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP method was used to perform these evaluations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  A report will be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and will include any resolutions and corrective action. \r\nEmployee Participation - Dominion believes that PSM and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\nHot Work Permit - Hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process will be issued by facility safety leaders.  The permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the date(s) authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\r\nContractors - Dominion hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Before any contractors are allowed to work on the facility, they undergo an orientation.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related the contractor's work, the hazards of regulated substances, the safe work procedures insisted on by Dominion, and familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures.

Safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility are in place to help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.  The facility utilizes safety features on many units to help minimize/control a release, quickly detect a release (e.g., flame and gas detectors with alarms), and reduce/mitigate the consequences of a release (e.g., fire suppression and extinguishing).\r\n\r\n4. Five-year Accident History - The West Union facility has experienced no accidental releases in the past five years.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program - The facility has coordinated emergency response activities with the Doddridge Emergency Squad Rescue Service and West Union Volunteer Fire Department.  The facility has a written emergency plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The plan includes actions to be taken including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
