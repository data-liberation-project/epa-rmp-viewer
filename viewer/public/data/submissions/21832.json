Westover Dairy also complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for ammonia. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Lynchburg City Fire Department and request that they respond.  \nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWestover Dairy receives, stores and processes milk products. Many of the products must be stored at temperatures near or below freezing and, therefore, ammonia refrigeration systems are needed to cool and/or freeze different areas throughout the process. \n\nThe facility was inventoried to determine the amount of ammonia typically stored on-site, as well as the amount of ammonia that could be stored in each piece of process equipment. The total system ammonia charge is 10,200 pounds. The largest vessel present in the system is the high-pressure receiver.   This vessel is filled to 80% of its capacity by NFPA codes, therefore the maximum quantity of 6,125 lbs. which is the amount used in the worst case release calculations.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario was determined to be the failure of the high-pressure receiver (6,125 lbs), when filled for storage. The high-pressure receiver is contained within a building. Using PhastProfessional computer modeling the distance to endpoint is a circle centered at the Compressor Room, with a 1.31 mile radius equivalent to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  \n\nFor the Alternative-Case Release Scenario, a rupturing of a 3/4 \" pipe was used.  The impact zone encompasses a circle with a radius of 0.20 miles. The alternative scenario extends to neig"

First and most, important, this facility is designed to promote prevention, both in the building itself and the equipment used as part of the refrigeration process. Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Audits are regularly conducted to determine if all safety provisions are being properly implemented. We have a preventative maintenance program and maintenance schedule which includes regular maintenance of compressors, pumps, evaporators, condensers, control valves, ammonia detectors, scrubbers and emergency response equipment.   Westover Dairy promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of ammonia with prevention as our goal. Westover Dairy employees are encouraged to voice their views on accident prevention issues and to recommend possible changes because we believe that safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.\n\nWestover Dairy also is regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule (PSM). This regulation requires many of the same regulations as the RMP requirements for Program 3 such as; Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity and others. The PSM rule also includes Employee Participation, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews and Trade Secrets. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has had one accident in the past five years that released about 39 pounds of liquid ammonia.  There were no offsite impact.  The release was attributed, after an investigation, to equipment failure. As a result of the investigation, the equipment was upgraded.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWestover Dairy has a written "
