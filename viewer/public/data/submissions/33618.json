M G Industries has developed Safety, Health and Environmental guidelines that have been incorporated in a comprehensive program defined as Quality Operating Procedures. These procedures are the minimal standards for M G Industries operations, including the Bradford, PA propane filling facility.\n\n\n\nThe objective of the program is to achieve an acceptable level of performance in the prevention of the losses to the organization which include but are not limited to accidents, injuries, illnesses, product liabilities and regulatory non-conformities. To be effective, this management system must be totally integrated in which all levels of employees are involved and held accountable.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate authority for instituting an effective EHS Program rests with the senior management of each operating group. Through their words and more importantly through their actions, senior management sets the tone for loss prevention throughout M G Industries. While senior management set the tone, middle management must create the uniform support and nurture the desired culture to influence the EHS Program. This strong management commitment culminates with the day to day responsibilities of implementing and managing the Quality Operating Procedures by 'line management' (supervisors and lead personnel). Local management is accountable for the effective management of this program through their organization's performance as related to loss prevention and regulatory compliance.\n"

This manual is maintained by local management and is available for review by any employee upon request during normal business hours. In addition, compliance with local and federal regulations such as DOT, FDA and EPA are required.\n\n\n\nAuthority and Responsibility for Program Implementation\n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager has the overall site authority for implementation of the EHS Program.

The fire department plays a critical role in this plan. MG Industries relies on the fire department to assist in the control and mitigation of an incident in this site, whereas MG Industries provides the technical expertise with respect to the equipment and the product. A comprehensive EHS Program exists at the facility that is managed both locally and at the MG Industries corporate level.\n\n    \n\nPlanned Changes to Improved Safety\n\n\n\nMG Industries is committed to continually improving our safety performance for all the operating units of the business. This is reflected in our 'Environmental Health and Safety  Policy' which states ' ..... All accidents, injuries and occupational illnesses are preventable. Practicing safety is a condition of employment for all employees. This means working safely, reporting unsafe acts and conditions, and actively participating in improving the company's environmental, health, and safety process.'  \n\n"
