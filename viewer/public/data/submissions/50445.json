      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Allens Montezuma - Plant #20 facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies outlined in the facility Emergency Response Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n                  1) To save lives;\n                  2) To minimize and avoid injuries;\n                  3) To protect the environment; and\n                  4) To minimize property damage.\nAllens maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency response coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazard information, and accident mitigation procedures.  The procedures will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations which may arise at the facility, including any accidental releases of ammonia.  The Plan is reviewed and updated at least once each year.  The Plan was recently reviewed for compliance with the PSM and RMP rules and revised to incorporate facility changes.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Allens facility chills and stores a variety of food products in the cold and frozen storage warehouse.  The facility is chilled by a refrigeration process that uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The refrigeration process, consisting of compressors, evaporators, condensers, vessels, piping, valves, and instrumentation, cycles the ammonia through various physical states, from  high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid.  These changes in the system pressure enable ammonia to absorb ambient heat and provide cooling to the food storage areas.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum ( approximately 6Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high pressure side.  The refrigeration process holds 29,424 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAcc"

The program was recently reviewed and procedures were revised as needed.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia in the past five years that meet the criteria for inclusion in the five-year accident history.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Allens Montezuma - Plant #20 Facility has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility is  training an Emergency Response Team to First Responder Operations Level, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).  Team members will receive annual refresher training as required.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Allens Montezuma-Plant #20  facility will implement the recommended action items resulting from the recent Process Hazard Analysis, and PSM Program review.  Employees will be trained on new or revised procedures as needed."
