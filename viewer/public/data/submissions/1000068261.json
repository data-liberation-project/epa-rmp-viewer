      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - Westside Facility - Sutter Home Winery, Inc.\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nSutter Home Winery, Inc. has established a risk management plan according to EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) for both Ammonia Refrigeration Systems at its Westside Facility to enhance its already existing safety programs.  Sutter Home is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  Sutter Home staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to provide safeguards.  The first Ammonia Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for chilling wine, for cooling down wine storage tanks and maintaining them at a cold temperature, and for condensing and storing alcohol vapors from the wine storage tanks.  \n\nThe Bottling Plant Ammonia Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for cooling down the Bottling Plant and maintaining the building at a cold temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSutter Home has an emergency action plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1.) To save lives.\n\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3.) To protect the environment.\n\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Action Plan include key phone numbers and contact points, plans for evacuation, fire, injury, earthquake, hazardous material spill, and ammonia health hazards \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Systems at the Westside Facility include compressors, high pressure receivers, low pressure receivers, suction traps, ammonia pumps, evaporative condensers, piping, valves, relief valves, chillers, jacketed storage tanks, air handling units, and diffusion tanks. \n\n\n\nAmmonia vapor, from the compressors, enters the evaporative condens"

      "SummaryText": "ers, where it is condensed to liquid after passing through the cooling coils.\n\n\n\nLiquid ammonia, at a pressure of approximately 165 psig, leaves the condenser and is sent to the High Pressure Receiver.  The High Pressure Receiver serves as a storage tank for the liquid ammonia before transfer to the Low Pressure Receiver.  \n\n\n\nLiquid leaving the High Pressure Receiver expands after passing through the expansion valves installed upstream of the Low Pressure Receiver.  The expansion causes ammonia temperature to drop to its boiling point, and thus for a refrigerant medium.  Pressure across the expansion valves drops from 165 psig to 35 psig.  At the bottom of the Low Pressure Receiver, there are four ammonia transfer pumps that are used to deliver liquid ammonia to the wine chillers and jacketed storage tanks or the Air Handling Units.  Expansion of ammonia in the chillers, tanks, and air handling units provides the desired cooling effect.  Vapor returns from the tanks, chillers, and air handling units to the Low Pressure Receiver, from which the compressors take suction. \n\n\n\nIn System 1, Alcohol vapors from the vapor space of the wine storage tanks are drawn via a blower through the tube side of the V-Bottom Fermentation Process Chiller.  The ammonia in the shell side of the chiller absorbs heat from the alcohol vapors and converts condenses alcohol vapors into liquid form.  Liquid alcohol is then sent to two Alcohol Capture Tanks.  The Alcohol Capture Tanks are cooled via expansion of ammonia in the jackets.\n\n\n\nSeveral safeguards are built into each Ammonia Refrigeration System.  All parts of the systems, except for the air handling units, wine chillers, jacketed storage tanks, and some piping are located within a building at the facility.  All relief valves are connected to a vent system which feeds into a Diffusion Tank, to limit the potential for ammonia release to the atmosphere.  In addition, ammonia detectors, as well as other instrumentation will trigger shut"

      "SummaryText": "down of the system in the event of an upset or release.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSutter Home Winery, Inc. has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program at the Westside Facility to manage the safety aspects of the two Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by industry sources.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility in the past 5 years that have lead to an injury, fatality or environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral process and management system improvements were considered and implemented as a result of the technical studies done in the course of the development of the PSM and RMP Programs and later when system upgrades were being engineered."
