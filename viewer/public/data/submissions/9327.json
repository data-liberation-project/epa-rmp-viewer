      "SummaryText": "a.  The City of Poplar Bluff Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The Poplar Bluff emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to our facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.  The Poplar Chlorination System has been installed to disinfect the flow in the entire system.  This water serves all of the city's demand.  The chlorination station is located at 108 Johnson Drive.  The station includes a chlorination room, which contains liquid chlorine containers, 2 chlorinators, and various safety equipment, and an instrument room, which contains feed rate display, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment.  The amount of chlorine handled is 4 one-ton containers.  The facility is always manned 24 hours/day.  The treatment plant operators immediately respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  We have on site a class \"B\" containment kit, emergency shower/eyewash, CL2 Alarm/ with battery backup/and remote display at plant master control panel.  We also have on site 3 SCBA'S plus 3 spare cylinders.  \n\nc.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine releas"

This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has been defined, \"to estimate the population affected\".\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Poplar Bluff Chlorination system involves a failure of a one ton-container (2,000 lb of chlorine).  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions re-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount of a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles and an estimate of residential population potentially affected of 1,783 was obtained.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a fuzible lead plug, possibly due to fire.  The amount of chlorine released is 2,000 lb., at an average rate 83.7 lbs/min. (the duration of the release) of 24/min.  Toxic endpoint distances to ERPG-2 levels were obtained.  Meterological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3.0 m/s, average air temperature of 62 degrees F, and 63% average humidity.  The estimated distances traveled to the toxic endpoints ar"

An additional mitigation system installed is the remote vacuum type.  This will reduce significantly the amount of chlorine released in case of a breach in the chlorine feed plumbing.\n\nd.  Our general on site accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n    -High level of training of the operators\n    -Preventive maintenance program\n    -Use of state-of-the-are process and safety equipment\n    -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, with the participation of the operators\n    -Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n    -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), to be utilized in the event of a leak of chlorine discharge, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.\n\ne.  No accidental releases of chlorine have accurred at this facility in the past twenty five years.\n\nf.  The facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes a list of key personnel and phone numbers, a notification and response procedures are also reviewed at that time."
