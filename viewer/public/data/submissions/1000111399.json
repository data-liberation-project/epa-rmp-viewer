The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.  Keystone Foods LLC has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN (ERP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Keystone Foods LLC as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  Keystone Foods LLC also has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental ammonia releases. These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function. These personnel also receive annual refresher training thereafter.  To plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Keystone Foods LLC Emergency Response Plan includes procedures/equipment to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nKeysto"

The RMP COMP models are referenced in the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the mathematical approximation process.  As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file with the Keystone Foods LLC Safety Manager's office.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of Microsoft Streets and Marplot mapping system software, and US Census Bureau 2010 data.\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The Keystone Foods LLC facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  Keystone Foods LLC has integrated various engineering and administrative control mechanisms to eliminate and/or minimize any possible upsets/releases from this facility including; electronic ammonia detection and alarms located throughout the facility, safety devices and interlocks that will shut down equipment exceeding safe operating limits, safety relief valves are installed on all pressure vessels, condensers, and oil separators to eliminate the possibility of an over-pressurization condition.  \n\n- Five-year Accident History\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems located within Keystone Foods LLC have have experienced no re"

This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facility's Hazmat Teams, Camilla Fire Department, and the Mitchell County Emergency Management Agency for emergency response support.\n\n- Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nKeystone Foods LLC Camilla processing plant, 7220 Highway 19 N, Camilla, Georgia, is located approximately two miles north of Camilla, Georgia. We are responsible for the processing of poultry products in various varieties.  The facility consists of two separate processing facilities at one location. The facilities use a discrete Anhydrous Ammonia closed loop refrigeration system as a heat removal media for each processing center.  Both plants operate around the clock (7) seven days a week.  As a result of a recognized highly toxic chemical used at the Keystone Foods LLC facility and in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Program, 40 CFR, Section 68 the facility has developed and implemented Program 3 requirements.  Additionally, the facility also has in place a Process Safety Management program for each process center as required by OSHA Standard 1910.119.  Each process center further uses this program as a management system per the outlined requirements in 40 CFR 68.15.  Having two separate ammonia refrigeration system process, the facility modeled a worst case and alternate case scenario for each process system for off-site consequence analyses.
