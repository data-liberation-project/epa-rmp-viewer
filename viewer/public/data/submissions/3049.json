Brooklyn Parks WTP is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing filtration, sedimentation, and disinfection. The quantities of chlorine used at the water treatment plant is greater than the Threshold Quantity of 2,500 pounds, which is EPAs criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the chlorine process and consideration was also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the plant as well.\n\nt is this facilitys intent to uphold industry standards in the operation of the facility and  it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, it is our policy and/or procedure to notify the Brooklyn Park Fire Department (via the 911 system) and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nChlorine is considered toxic by EPA standards.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment agent and fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chemicals; combined with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe chlorine system at the WTP consists of one ton chlorine cylinders, scales, chlorinators, vacuum regulators, diffusers, injectors, residual analyzers, leak detectors and a chlorine emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine cylinders, scales and vacuum regulators are located in Room 135.  Room 134 houses the chlorinators and the chlorine neutralization system is located in Room 211.

Generally the facility has two cylinders in operation and two cylinders in waiting.  The WTP chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room are equipped with chlorine detectors.  These rooms are also connected to a sodium hydroxide emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The distribution/piping system is constructed of schedule 80 PVC piping and is operated under a negative pressure (vacuum). \n\nWorst-Case Scenario (WCS) Chlorine -- 2,000 lb. is the maximum quantity of chlorine  in a single storage vessel that can be released in a WCS.  For WCS, according to EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities criteria, the distance to toxic endpoint for this WCS is 1.3 miles.  The facility is located in a populated, urban area with an estimated population of  13,656 persons living within the 1.3 mile radius (per Landview III software*).  No environmental receptors (as defined by 40 CFR Part 68) are located within this radius.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) for chlorine --  the release chosen is a <\" diameter hole releases chlorine for 10 minutes from the process line in the chlorine storage room and the scrubber fails to activate. Passive mitigation is considered for the release occurring inside the building.  The distance to toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 miles, which reaches residential housing and an estimated population of 18 within this distance (per Landview III software*).\n\n* This Landview III software was issued Dec. 1997 and utilized 1990 census data.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt is this facilitys intent to comply with EPAs accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
