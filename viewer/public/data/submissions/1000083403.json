The facility operates at the intersection of 131st Ave. SW and 38th St. SW and has a legal location indicated as the NW1/4 NW1/4 Section 17, Township 139N, Range 99W.\n\n\n\nProcess Description:\n\nMPLX operates the Belfield Gas Plant located in Stark County, North Dakota (ND). The gas plant is located 2 miles south of Belfield, ND on US Hwy 85 and ? mile west on 38 Street SW. The facility runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The site is manned 24 hours a day by operators located at the plant site. \n\n\n\nThe plant processes natural gas delivered from producing wells. The natural gas enters the plant via gathering pipelines. The gas then flows through the inlet receiver to remove all free liquids.  The gas then flows to the inlet compressors at 10-50 psig.  The inlet compressors compress the gas to approximatley 400 psig, the gas then flows to the H2S removal process and then on to the NGL plant. The compressed gas is then routed through an NGL skid with ethylene glycol (EG) injection which removes water from the stream.   The gas then flows through various exchangers and a refrigerated chiller and onto the 3-phase seperator where the EG and NGLS are seperated from the gas stream. \n\n\n\nThe rich EG is routed to the dehydration still column, which is heated from the facility's hot oil heaters, to assist in driving off the water and regenerating the rich EG.  Gas stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor, which is condensed and sent to storage tanks and the non-condensables are burned at a Steffes Flare.  All flash vapors off"

The fractionated NGLs (Propane, Butane and Natural Gasoline) are collected in purity tanks and then transported via tanker trucks/pipeline for marketing. \n\n\n\nAt the process outlet, the gas is compressed to approximately 1200 psig and sold to WBI Pipeline Company. \n\n\n\nProgram Level:\n\nIt has been determined that this is a Program 3 facility.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Stark County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and agency personnel have a chance to tour the facility.  Belfield Gas Plant takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances: \n\nEthane, butane, propane and pentane are the components listed in the RMP rule. All of the chemicals above the RMP threshold are classified as flammable and not toxic. As such, only a flammable release scenario has been analyzed for the Belfield Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nThis is facility has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response a"

The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility will be implementing the following changes to improve safety:\n\n1.    Adding high temperature transmitters with shutdown capabilities on the discharge of air coolers to protect personnel from temperatures above 140?F.\n\n2.    Adding shutdown valve to Cold Separator Dump line to close in the event that the dump valve is stuck open.  This will prevent gas blowby and potential release in the EG Regenerator Unit.\n\n3.    Retrofit pumps with dual seals and seal pot alarms to alert operations of a seal leak and shutdown the pump.\n\n"
