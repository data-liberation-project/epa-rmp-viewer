This RMP covers facility #1000 0002 4065 (New Design Road Water Treatment Plant).  This facility is the largest of the Water Treatment Plants (WTP) owned and operated by Frederick County.\n\n\n\nThis facility treats about 5.4 mgd of water drawn from the Potomac River.  The New Design Road facility provides water service to 40,600 residential customers (15,034 residential accounts) and 896 commercial /industrial accounts.  Twenty eight thousand pounds of Chlorine (14 ton containers) is the maximum amount of Chlorine that is stored at this facility at any given time.  At this time there are no other hazardous chemicals stored at or above the reportable quantities.  There has never been a release of Chlorine at this facility that has escaped off-site.  \n\n \n\nFrederick County insurance carriers make site inspections of DUSWM facilities including the New design Road WTP.  These inspections include a review of policies, procedures, training, environmental permits, contingency plans, and tier II inventories.  The last insurance inspection for this facility was completed on 03/14/14.  Travelers Insurance Company carries the County's contractor liability insurance and inspected the facility.  Mike Owens from Travelers reviewed plans, policies, training and other records and inspected the completed construction site.  Bill Jenkins from Ohio Casualty (County Property insurer) inspected the New Design facility, and took pictures of the construction area on 03/14/14.  As a result of the last audit Frederick County Division of Fire and Rescue conducted a Hazardous Materials Pre-Emergency Response Plan on Sept 26, 28 &"

This facility has is also visited by the Frederick County Department of Fire & Rescue services annual for a A?preplan updateA? to familiarize new staff with the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION II & III\n\n\n\nBoth Release scenarios used in this RMP use a single ton container of chlorine.  With the policies, procedures, current equipment including the chlorine scrubber system, and the safety record of this facility, it is believed that this is the largest amount of chlorine that would be released in a single incident.  Please note that this facility has an enclosed chlorine storage area.  Chlorine sensors are connected to a chlorine scrubber system.  In the unlikely event that a chlorine leak occurs, chlorine would be contained within the room, with the air in the room being evacuated through the chlorine scrubber system. \n\n \n\nThe first scenario in this RMP is a chlorine gas release that takes place over a 10 Minute period of time.  This time is the estimated time that it would take the sensors on the scrubber system to activate and alarm, personnel to respond with appropriate PPE and equipment and then begin a valve or line repair, or seal the container.  It should be noted that this facility uses vacuum regulators and in the unlikely event that a line were to break the chlorine feed system would lose vacuum and the system would shut down thus no chlorine leak through a line break.\n\n\n\nThe second scenario is a rupture of a fusible plug (relief valve) with the total contents of the container empting in eight (8) minutes.  This time frame is based on the  of the fusible plug and emptying of the entire container.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\n\n\nFrederick County DUSWM does not use or store flammable chemicals/materials subject to RMP reporting requirements, therefore there are no scenarios submitted for flammable materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION VI    \n\n\n\nThe New Design Road WTP has an excellent safety record.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred in the 40 years plus operatio"

Review of the facility specific SOPs and Division policies and procedures are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nBecause of the critical nature of water supply, Frederick County DUSWM has build redundancy into many of its most critical processes.  This redundancy included dual power and generators for power failure incidences, duplicate pumps, controls, and sensors of other equipment.  Audible and visual alarms and procedures are in place for routine and emergency process control.  Automatic controls and shutoffs are equipped with manual backups in the event of power failure or other emergencies that may cause equipment control failure.  This facility is also monitored by a SCADA (Supervisor Control And Data Acquisition) System.  The system is monitored both at the plant and at the DivisionA?s Maintenance shop, with plans to add another monitoring station at the DivisionA?s Administration building in the very near future.\n\n \n\nThis facility has a closed Circuit Television (CCTV) at the main gate to the facility.  This gate is electrically operated with either key card access or manual operation from within the facilityA?s administration building when the call box is activated.  Chlorine container and chlorine feed is located in a building detached from the general administration and laboratory building.  The Chlorine building is not ventilated to the outside atmosphere and is equipped with a chlorine scrubber system.  Chlorine detectors are stationed at critical areas and connected to audible and visual alarms.  This system and its sensors is tested routinely in accordance with established manufacture protocols.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.  All policies and procedures are reviewed annually as well as for this RMP.  Frederick County DUSWM has an extensive Occupational Health & Safety Program.  This prog"
