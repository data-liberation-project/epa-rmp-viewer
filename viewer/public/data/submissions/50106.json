In this way we promote overall plant,\n\nworker and public safety.  This program enables our facility\n\nto prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences, of\n\nsignificant releases of toxic substances as well as fires,\n\nexplosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.\n\nOverall, this program prevents accidental fatalities,\n\ninjuries and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving\n\nhazardous chemicals including any use, storage,\n\nmanufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of such\n\nchemicals or combination of these activities.  Any group of\n\nvessels, which are interconnected and separate vessels,\n\nwhich are located such that a hazardous chemical could be\n\ninvolved in a potential release, shall be considered a\n\nsingle process.\n\n\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on\n\nthe rules, procedures and practices, which govern individual\n\nprocesses, activities or pieces of equipment.  These rules\n\nare detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also\n\ncommunicated to and accepted by all employees at the\n\nfacility.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill.\n\nMechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather\n\nthan a chemical process.  Ammonia, the refrigerant, is used\n\nas a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature\n\nin a closed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists\n\nof four processes:  expansion, evaporation, compression and\n\ncondensation.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to\n\nalter the quantity of energy associated with the\n\nrefrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to\n\nchange th"

The\n\nammonia refrigeration cycle is in a closed system utilizing\n\nfluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization\n\nfor cooling.  To evaporate liquid ammonia to a vapor, latent\n\nheat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid.\n\n\n\nThis location has prepared both a worst case and an\n\nalternative case release scenario using the ALOHA air\n\ndispersion modeling software which calculates the distance\n\nto the toxic endpoints.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental\n\nrelease prevention program for this facility's ammonia\n\nrefrigeration system is comprised of the following\n\ncomponents:  Process safety information, process hazard\n\nanalysis, operating procedures, operator training,\n\nprocedures for maintaining mechanical integrity, procedures\n\nfor managing system changes, pre-start up safety review\n\nprocedures, procedures for investigating release incidents\n\nand hot work permit protocols.  This program was developed\n\nwith the participation of the affected employees and will be\n\nperiodically audited for compliance required by the RMP\n\nregulations.  In addition, the facility has in place\n\nprocedures for notifying contractors and their employees of\n\nthe hazards of the system.  Chemical specific prevention\n\nsteps are included within the program, including engineering\n\nand administration controls designed to prevent and minimize\n\naccidental releases.\n\n\n\nIn the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, this\n\nfacility has not had any accidental releases of the ammonia\n\nwhich have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant\n\nproperty damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries,\n\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or\n\nenvironmental damage.\n\n\n\nCargill's emergency response program is based on the OSHA\n\nrequirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and\n\n1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We maintain a\n\nwritten emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated\n\nwith the "
