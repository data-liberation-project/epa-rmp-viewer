The goal of the combined Risk Management Program (RMProgram) is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from accidental release of chemicals.  The organization's management is committed to achieving this goal.  Employees have a safety meeting monthly regarding chemical safety.\n\n\n\nChlorine is transported by truck on US 27 from Lexington, KY to the Stanford Water Treatment plant by C.I. Thornburg, 740 Enterprise Drive, Lexington, KY 405140, (859) 255-0852.  Cylinders are unloaded by using overhead hoist.\n\n\n\nNo emergency equipment is kept on site, therefore if any release occurs, the operators will report to the appropriate staging area.  Employees who are not contaminated will be transported to the appropriate staging area.  Evacuation routes for off-site evacuation, if necessary, would be Hwy 698 northeast to US 27 to Stanford.  In place sheltering may be directed by local officials, following consultation with KY EM personnel, facility representatives and other technically qualified authorities.  This option may be chosen if the release is expected to be of short duration, because of inclement weather, or there is not enough time to safely evacuate the threatened area.  Citizens will be advised of the situation through emergency service public address systems.  If the area is evacuated, reentry into the evacuated area will be restricted until the Fire Chief or Lincoln Co. EM Director determines that it is safe.  Final decontamination will be performed at the Ephraim McDowell Fort Logan Hospital in Stanford.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a release, if the door to the facility can be closed safely, the spill will be contained in the chlorine room.  Spill containment, cleanup and disposal will be accomplished per EPA and KY Dept. of Natural Resources regulations.  Potential remedial measures may include a "

      "SummaryText": "water spray can be directed at the vapors, not the point of leak, to reduce vapors.  This runoff may be contained and neutralized with soda ash.  The hazardous materials clean-up will be performed by the KYDEM Region 12 Hazmat Team, (606) 679-3200, 24 hour Emergency 911.  Chemtrec could also be called to activate Chlorep (Chlorine Emergency Response Team) to clean up the spill.  Any cleanup of hazardous waste will be accomplished through a plan approved by KY Natural Resources and/or US EPA.  The facility, if invited, will participate in exercises with city and county responders.  \n\n\n\nThe radius of concern during a Worst Case Release has been determined to be 2.2 miles according to MARPLOT using a total release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine. Depending on the severity of emergency, facility response points will consist one of two locations.  In the event of a minor emergency, the primary location will be at the end of Water Works Road.  In the event of a significant emergency, primary response location will be the parking lot of the now vacant old Somerset Oil station.  The Facility Representative who meets the off-site response personnel shall have a copy of the Emergency Response Plan, MSDS sheets and should brief the responders on the current situation. An immediate assessment of release severity, wind direction, response requirements, and modifications to the plan will need to be made at that time.\n\n\n\nThe City of Stanford Water Plant has not had a chlorine release within the past 5 years.\n\n "
