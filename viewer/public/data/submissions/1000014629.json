Safety programs include formal training and on-the-job training activities.  GHS compliant Safety Data Sheets and other chemical related safety information is made available to employees.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\n\nThis facility receives, stores, and ships anhydrous ammonia for re-sale purposes only (retail to the end user - crop production).  This is a minor portion of the facility's business.  This facility is primarily a fertilizer and ag-chem retail facility.  The facility has two 50-ton storage tanks.  The facility receives inbound anhydrous ammonia via transport trucks.  The two-tank system is used for storage of the material until it is sold for use by the customer.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nRelease prevention activities involve daily inspections, routine equipment inspections, and an annual maintenance inspection/evaluation of all equipment.  Operating and maintenance procedures have been developed.  Employee training programs are continuously reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases with the past five (5) years that resulted in off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nEmergency response activities include coordination with the Tifton/Tift County Emergency Management Agency.  Employees are aware of the facility Emergency Response Plan.  A copy is available upon request.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nEquipment, procedures, and training activities are being reviewed and will be updated to improve safety as determined by the ongoing review process."
