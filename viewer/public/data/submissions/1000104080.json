The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the spring and summer months. The plant produces fresh and frozen processed seafood products.  The facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed system as the refrigerant for freezers and cold storage.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. Machine Rooms 1 & 3 are both within the same building structure. In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release. The plant has been operating safely since 1962.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods has a prevention program in place to comply with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and EPA Risk Management Program, which is designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The PSM/RMP program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safely, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system itself has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, and check valves.  Plant personnel responsible for the system have training in ammonia syste"

      "SummaryText": "ms and hazardous material handling and response. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nPer the requirement of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years. \n\nEmergency Action Plan\nAlaska Pacific Seafoods maintains a written emergency action plan as part of the PSM/RMP program to facilitate action during accidental ammonia releases. The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an incident. Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, coordinating with local responders, as well as emergency preparedness. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process; safety meetings; employee suggestions; accident, incident and near-miss investigations; and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order. Enhanced coordination with local responders is planned to meet updated RMP regulations."
