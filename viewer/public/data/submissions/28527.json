The City of Arcadia Water Treatment Facility (WTF) facility was installed to treat well water for providing potable water to Desoto County, City of Arcadia service subscribers.  The facility is located at 645 Turner Road (27?13?14? North Latitude and 81?50?30? West Longitude) and includes a chlorine storage area containing liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment as well as process treatment tanks and equipment.  A maximum of four (4) one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  The facility is staff 16 hours a day 7 days a week on site with on-call coverage 24 hours a day, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.    The City of Arcadia accidental release prevention program at the Turner Road facility involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The City of Arcadia emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (?ERP?) requirements.\n\nc.    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as ?worst-case release? and ?alternative release.?  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, ?the owner or operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.?\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (?ppm?), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (?ERPG-2?).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Associati"

      "SummaryText": "on (?AIHA?) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance must be defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n\ni.    The worst-case release scenario at the Turner Road facility involves a failure of a single one-ton cylinder (2,000 lb) connected to the chlorination system.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\n(a)     It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.  The 3-ppm one-hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten-minute release time; the value obtained is 7.3 ppm.\n\n(b)    Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6.25% of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily maximum temperature (96oF), and average relative humidity (74%) were inputs for analysis of the toxic endpoint presented.\n\nWhen the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and calculations based on Chapter 4 of the EPA publi"

      "SummaryText": "cation Wastewater Treatment Plants Risk Management Program Guidence, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles and an estimate of residential population affected of 5,826 was obtained.  In a plume footprint representing 6.25% of the total potential impact area, the estimated affected residential population would be 365 people.\n\nii.  The alternative release scenario involves an accident resulting in the breaking of a regulator from a one-ton container connected to the chlorination system.  The potential chlorine released would be 2,000 lb over 5.8 minutes.  In acceptance of Exhibit 4-12 criteria, typical meteorological conditions of an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3 m/s were used.  The estimated distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was 0.3 miles.  The estimated population affected was 533 within a full circle of 1.5-mile radius and 34 within the plume footprint.\n    \nd.    The City of Arcadia accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?    High level training of the operators\n?    Preventive maintenance program\n?    Use of industry standard process and safety equipment\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\n\n?    Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\n?    The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators \n?    Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n?    Presence of chlorine detectors.\n\ne.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.    The Turner Road facility has an emergency response program, which includes emergency response training of personnel, establishment of specific procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release, and coordination with the Desoto County Fire Department."
