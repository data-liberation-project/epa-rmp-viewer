      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries Turlock Dairy Division abides by the emergency action procedures and policies detailed in the Emergency Action Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n - To save lives.\n\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n - To protect the environment.\n\n - To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries maintains an emergency action team whose members are trained to First Responder at the Operations Level.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries facility is located at 2600 Spengler Way in Turlock, California.  This location is situated along Kilroy Road, approximately 0.6 miles south of West Main Street and 0.7 miles west of Highway 99.  The area is primarily industrial with sparse residential areas to all sides. \n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures food products such as orange juice, flavored drinks, ice cream, sour cream, cheese, and yogurt.  The facility was originally built in 1988.  The facility was later expanded in 1994 to install additional processing equipment.  The facility currently covers approximately 148,000 square feet.  \n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries Turlock Dairy Division uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and process e"

      "SummaryText": "quipment.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 14.4\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.  The total ammonia inventory is 117,500 pounds.  \n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nAdministrative Measures\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Super Store Industries facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHAA?s Process Safety Management regulation.\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machine room and the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down mechanisms that protect the integrity of the machinery.  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressu"

      "SummaryText": "re relief valves that vent pressure in case of an extremely high pressure situation.\n\n\n\nEngineering/Design Measures\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries operates the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for manufacturing and storing various food products.  The system has several inherent features including:\n\n\n\n1. Ammonia, when properly handled, has proven to be a reliable and safe refrigerant.  Industry has used ammonia as a refrigerant for over 100 years.\n\n\n\n2. The facility is manned 24 hours a day with qualified ammonia personnel.  Having personnel always on-site shortens the response time in the event that an ammonia-related emergency occurs at the facility.\n\n\n\n3. An off-site company is used to monitor designated system alarms.  In the event of a designated alarm, the offsite company contacts the plant and also designated off-duty personnel (as necessary).  \n\n\n\n4. The facility is located in an industrial area away from concentrated residential populations.  This location decreases the probability of impacting sensitive populations in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the Super Store Industries A? Turlock facility accident history revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years (March 2009 - March 2014). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries has implemented an Emergency Action Team that is trained to handle small ammonia events.  All refrigeration operators are OSHA Operation Level trained (8 hours) and all supervisors are OSHA First Responder at the Operations Level trained (8 hours).  The Super Store Industries' Emergency Response Plan, is designed to meet the requirements for \"Process Safety Management\", and give our employees and community the maximum protection in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": " contents of this plan are used in the Hazardous Materials Business Plan which is filed with the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources, as well as to update the existing plan in the Training Program Manual. The process for developing the best possible mitigation to any release large or small is through employee participation using the Process Safety Management Committee, and any site specific documented plan previously used. \n\n\n\nSuper Store Industries conducts on-site evacuation drills to provide training and to evaluate employee response in the event of a potential release.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A PHA Revalidation was completed in January 2014 that generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.    \n\n\n\nThe Safety Manager is working with the plant engineers to ensure appropriate safety programs are implemented and that identified safety issues are resolved.\n\n\n\nREGISTRATION NOTE:\n\n\n\nThe Super Store Industries Turlock facility uses 117,500 pounds of ammonia in the refrigeration system.  However, EPA requires that the quantity be reported to two significant digits.  Therefore, for Section 1.17 of the RMP submittal, the quantity was reported as 120,000 pounds."
