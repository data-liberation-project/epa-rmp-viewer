KFDC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKFDC produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.     \n\n\n\nThe ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at KFDC in amounts above threshold quantity.  Chlorine was reported in previous RMPs, but has been removed as the facility no longer uses it for water treatment in the cooling water system.  All chlorine cylinders have been removed from the facility and replaced with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), which is not an RMP substance.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity. The f"

These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n-    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nKFDC is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Removing chlorine in the cooling towers and replacing it with sodium hypochlorite thereby reducing the risk of a toxic release of chlorine from the facility.\n\n-    Constructing a blast-proof building to house the control room, maintenance personnel, and administrative offices.  The building may also be used by KFDC as an emergency shelter as needed.\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\n-    Locating emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas that can be activated in case of an ammonia release.\n\n-    Providing a means of fire and or vapor suppressi"

The incident occurred in October 2013 and resulted in an injury that required medical treatment.

Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n-    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n-    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n-    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n-    Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\n-    An ongoing dialogue with the Ford County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\n\n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Ford County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.
