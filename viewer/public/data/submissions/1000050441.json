This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained operating personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nNWGP Gas Treating Facility, located in New Plymouth, Idaho, operates a facility designed to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate) from natural gas.  The NWGP Gas Treating Facility has several regulated flammables, such as pentane, isopentane, isobutaene, butane, propane and ethane\r\n\r\nToxics\r\nNo toxic substances are present in the facility.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nNWGP is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) risk management program (RMP) regulation and by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  The RMP regulation and PSM standard are implemented in the Facility and this summary describes the PSM elements and management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nNorthwest Gas Processing, LLC strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, and hazard communications, as well as special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.  All employees are given the authorization for stop-work direction to anyone that they observe to possibly be en"

Employees are also encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address physical and chemical property and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design and configuration information.  Specific personnel within the company are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Reference documents, which are kept in the control room, are readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material data safety sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known chemical/physical concerns (e.g. corrosion) and any known hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific facility areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a process control document.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written proce"

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, NWGP periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel, as well as third party consultants, may be utilized to participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to NWGP management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility complies with the OSAH PSM rule and the EPA RMP rule.  Key to the prevention program is the combined use of technological and procedural steps to avoid risk.  The use of process controls, i.e. vents, relief valves, check valves, flares, manual and automatic shutoffs, for example, along with alarms and their corresponding procedures are important parts of the NWGP program.  NWGP also has monitoring/detection systems in place, i.e. gas detectors, and mitigation features, i.e. dikes and emergency shutdown devices (ESDs) all of which are components to the overall NWGP program.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the NWGP Gas Treating Facility.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. NWGP incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support per"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the NWGP Gas Treating Facility is coordinated with the local emergency responders through the local emergency planning committee (Payette County LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The NWGP facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations, including the local fire departments and emergency medical providers.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, NWGP intends to conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.  NWGP also intends to provide annual refresher training to the local emergency response organizations regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nDuring the initial Process Hazard Analysis, NWGP responded to findings by making various facility revisions.  Included in the revisions were the addition of gas detectors, pressure relief valves, automated shutdowns, and equipment redundancy.  NWGP will continue to address safety as the facility comes on-line for the first time.  NWGP believes in continuous process improvement to ensure the facility operates properly and as safely as possible."

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, ( 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. NWGP personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemen"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.    \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various process operations.  The procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training for new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  These procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, NWGP maintains process-specific documents that provide guidance on how to respond to exceedances/excursions for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the facility and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, NWGP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates competency (e.g. through tests, OTJ skills demonstration) to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operating,"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe NWGP Gas Treating Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.
