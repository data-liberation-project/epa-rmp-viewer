The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and liquid recirculator. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are each equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the systems. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators/hydrocoolers. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators and hydrocooler coils. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators and hydrocoolers is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator or recirculator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSubcooler\n\nThe subcooler receives and subcools liquid from the P2 high pressure receiver in order to supply subcooled liquid to the flooded accumulators. The subcooler is a plate and frame heat exchanger that uses a supply of low temperature ammonia to cool high pressure liquid ammonia. On the low temperature side, the subcooler is equipped with an expansion valve which expands high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the heat exchanger. On"

Under normal conditions, the subcooler contains low and high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nRecirculators (Accumulator 5 and Accumulator 6)\n\nThe purpose of Accumulators 5-6 (Process 1) is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in evaporators throughout the facility. Accumulators 5-6 receive liquid from the high pressure receiver and supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the ammonia pumps mounted underneath the vessels. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside Accumulators 5-6 to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Accumulators 5-6 are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.

The oil pots are equipped with spring-return oil drain valves which are used to drain oil from the system as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pots contain low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators (flooded) is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature.

The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer pump. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.

The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from Accumulator 5. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators and hydrocoolers to the atmosphere.

The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers and oil coolers. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver and oil coolers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nOil Coolers\n\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through them.
