The low pressure liquid in the heat exchanger absorbs heat from the high pressure liquid on the other side of each plate. The subcooled high pressure liquid exits the subcooler and is supplied to each zone of refrigeration. Under normal conditions, the subcooler contains low and high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nRecirculators (Accumulator 5 and Accumulator 6)\r\nThe purpose of Accumulators 5-6 (Process 1) is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in evaporators throughout the facility. Accumulators 5-6 receive liquid from the high pressure receiver and supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the ammonia pumps mounted underneath the vessels. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside Accumulators 5-6 to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Accumulators 5-6 are equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, Accumulators 5-6 contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nOil Pots\r\nThe purpose of the oil pots is to provide a safe location to drain oil from the refrigeration system. The oil pots receive liquid ammonia and oil from the recirculator and vent ammonia vapor back to the recirculator. The oil pots are equipped with spring-return oil drain valves which are used to drain oil from the system as needed. Under normal conditions, the oil pots contain low pressure liquid ammonia, low pressure vapor ammonia, and refrigerant oil.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators (flooded) is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature.

The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration and liquid recirculator. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment.

The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators and hydrocooler coils.
