Dandy orchestrates its PSM Program with participation from WPS, Duda, Contractors, and Oxnard Fire/CUPA.\n\nDandy personnel perform daily observations of refrigerating equipment; WPS performs technical inspections, troubleshooting and mechanical maintenance of the equipment. Schedules and written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release, have been developed. Written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, inspection, maintenance, and moving of portable equipment (Hydro-Vac\u2122 Vacuum Tubes). As inspection and maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager. The specific task for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the service call system. Tasks are then tracked to completion through the service call system. Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Dandy and WPS reduce equipment operational problems and potential for releases.

The facility was constructed in 2007 and began operating in early 2008. Building space occupies approximately 67,000 square feet on a 5.5 acre lot. The refrigeration process is a state-of-the-art system engineered and installed according to the codes and standards locally adopted by the City of Oxnard circa 2007. Cutting-edge safety controls are engineered directly into the plant. Refrigeration process engineering was provided by Snowden Engineering of Salinas, CA; the refrigeration system installing contractor was Kemper Refrigeration. Ongoing maintenance is managed via Dandy\u2019s relationship with WPS. The only change in the refrigeration system in the last 5 years was the addition of a water chiller of the same type already in use.\n\nTwo separate companies employing entirely separate workforces operate at the Plant: Dandy Cooling Company (Dandy) and Duda Farm Fresh Foods (Duda).

The ammonia process is equipped with a state-of-the-art monitoring, control and alarm system. The system was permitted by the Oxnard Fire/CUPA agency according to locally adopted code requirements including CFC Article 63-2001 circa 2007. The alarm system is supervised by a third party alarm company. If and when an ammonia leak is detected, notifications and alarms are provided to management, employees and refrigeration technicians according to alarm intensity. Automatic shutdown and ventilation systems are activated according to pre-set parameters. In the event of a major release involving the Refrigeration Room, the supervising alarm company provides direct and immediate notification to Oxnard Fire/CUPA in addition to the other alarms and management notifications. A secondary alarm system provides low-level alarm text messaging to refrigeration technicians when sensors detect ammonia at 20PPM, enabling early problem detection.
