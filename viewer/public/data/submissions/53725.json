The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Quantum Foods facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\n3. The Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and other equipment are inside the Quantum Foods building.  A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. These include:\n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nSafework Practices\nEmployee and Operator Training Programs\nMechanical Integrity Program\nManagement of Change Procedures\nPSM Compliance Audit Procedures\nIncident Investigation Procedures\nEmployee Participation Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nContractor Safety Program\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAmmonia specific prevention steps include:\n\nAdministrative controls\nOperator Training\nComputerize"

Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\n5. The five-year accident history\n\nNo reportable accident has occurred within the last five years.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Quantum Foods has implemented a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n Emergency response is discussed in the RMP.  Quantum Foods has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Quantum Foods conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nQuantum Foods is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows Quantum Foods to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Quantum Foods employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administ"
