The ammonia refrigeration process (process) has been designed, and operates in compliance with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention rule and applicable State and local codes and regulations. CCNNE has qualified engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel knowledgeable in the safe operation of compressed ammonia systems in direct responsibility of the process.  The process is also designed and operated in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Process Safety Management (OSHA-PSM) rule. \n\nThrough its Emergency Action Plan as required under OSHA-PSM, and through close communication with the Londonderry Fire Department, CCNNE has emergency response procedures in place which comply with the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP).\n\n2.0 A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCCNNE is a soft drink processing facility engaged in the preparation and packaging of carbonated beverages.  The facility maintains approximately 13,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the process.  The ARPP applicability threshold for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  As CCNNEs anhydrous ammonia storage capacity exceeds this threshold, the facility is subject to the program and is required to prepare a RMP for this process.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at CCNNE is the only process that stores a substance in greater quantities than the ARPP applicability threshold.\n\nThe process is subject to Risk Management Program 3 because CCNNE is subject to OSHA-PSM provisions and it is not eligible for Program 1.\n\n3.0 THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on a rupture of an storage vessel HPR-1 that contains 4,150 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The worst-case radius of impact (or distance to toxic endpoint) for rural conditi"

      "SummaryText": "ons given a release mass of 4,150 pounds is 6,350 feet, or 1.2 miles.  The estimated population affected by the worst-case release scenario has been estimated to be 1,130 persons.  The facility is located approximately 0.5 miles west of Route I-93 in a mixed use area consisting of industrial, commercial, and residential properties. Computerized census mapping do not indicate schools or religious institutions within the worst-case release scenario radius of influence; however, a field survey and a review of U.S. Geologic Survey information indicate that at least one school, a day care center, several small businesses and numerous residences (North Londonderry center) lie within the worst-case radius of influence.  No other public or environmental receptors have been identified within the worst-case release radius of influence.\n\n4.0 THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe process is currently designed and maintained in compliance with both American National Standards Institute guidance and American Society of Mechanical Engineering guidance.  The schedule of such verifications are at least once every three years, and are completed either by CCNNE using competent mechanical personnel, or by an outside mechanical contractor. \n\nPreventative maintenance (PM) is an active part of CCNNEs daily operations.  PM is performed on a schedule in accordance with OSHA-PSM and, in many cases, the process safety equipment PM schedule prescribed by CCNNE exceeds recommended equipment maintenance schedules.  CCNNE personnel visually inspect the general ammonia system components for leaks daily.  On a monthly basis, compressor suction traps are drained, ammonia system strainers are cleaned, piping is inspected, and pumps are rotated.  The ammonia system control system (programmable logic controller) and emergency systems are tested for normal and emergency operation functions annually.  Equipment maintenance schedules are strictly ad"

Upon alarm, a \"horn\" evacuation signal is triggered in the ammonia compressor room, a strobe light is activated, and a siren will sound at the main exit of the plant.  \n\nIn the event of a process release and subsequent alarm activation, CCNNE personnel would contact the Londonderry Fire Station if any of the following conditions are present:\n7 Upon investigating the incident, CCNNE determines that the release is severe enough to require response assistance; or  \n7 A potential for fire exists. \n\nThe Londonderry Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC, or Londonderry Fire Department) is trained and equipped to respond to ammonia releases at CCNNE."
