It may also include changes to structural components depending on their effect on the process; (3) Changes in process chemicals, catalysts, manufacturing recipes or technology; (4) Software changes to control systems for equipment and processes.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Woodriver CO2 facility has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

The plant personnel are trained on these safe work practices to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nAir Liquide America L.P. has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change (MOC) procedure.  This procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact and approving planned deviations from procedure.  The MOC system is a systematic process designed to help prevent inadvertent, unintended or unauthorized changes that may cause unsafe conditions, product quality problems, process hazards, unplanned outages, etc.  This standard also helps to ensure that changes are technically sound and that Quality and HSE safeguards originally designed into the facility are either maintained or enhanced.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAir Liquide America defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and Reporting procedure.  The purpose of incident investigation and reporting is to identify root causes and correct them rather than simply addressing the symptom of the incident.  Incident investigation and reporting is one of the primary methods used to continuously improve our operations by sharing information, root causes and corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.  Reports are retained for at least 5 years to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help insure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Woodriver CO2 plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  A team knowledgeable about the facility must conduct the audit, but the majority of the team must not be involved in the day-to-day operations of the ammonia.  Recommendations and findings from the Audit team are resolved in a timely manner.  The plant manager is responsible for obtaining engineering support to correct or modify the system based on the recommendations.  Resolutions to the recommendations are documented.  Once the resolutions have been completed, communication of the changes are made to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the Woodriver CO2 plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\nRelease Detection\n- Ammonia detectors set to trip at 40 ppm located inside plant building.\n- Drager Tubes for use in local leak detection \nRelease Containment/Control\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process. (Manual & automatic)\n- Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release.  \n\nRelease Mitigation\n- Coordination with ammonia emergency responder in event of an accidental release.  \n- Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, and Air-Line respirators)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Woodriver CO2 plant has an excellent record of accident prevention and there has been no accident resulting in any offsite effects in the last 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Woodriver CO2 plant employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substance and will only maintain a written emergency action plan. This emergency action plan consists of procedures for notifying emergency responders when there is a need to respond to a release of a regulated substance.  The document describes coordination with local response agencies, outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release and provides detailed evacuation procedures. \nIf an emergency involving the release of ammonia occurs that will have off-site consequences the Roxana Fire department and the Madison County Local Emergency Planning Committee shall coordinate evacuation of the affected community.

The plant has 3 employees.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe Woodriver CO2 facility is regulated by EPA RMP regulations and subject to OSHA PSM standard.  The summary below discusses some of the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAt the Woodriver CO2 facility, employees are encouraged to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan at the CO2 plant.  This plan includes the participation of employees in process hazard analysis (PHA), pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), and being involved in incident investigations surrounding the plant.   Plant employees are trained on the plant Process Safety Information, to include at least the following: (1) information pertaining to the hazards of the hazardous chemicals in the process; (2) information pertaining to the technology of the process; and (3) information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  Plant employees are involved in the review of PSM/RMP covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes.  The employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety and employee safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Woodriver CO2 facility keeps a variety of technical documents in the company's electronic document control system and on site, that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provide in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) or in the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), Ammonia Data Book located in the plant managers office.  Information on the compatibility and reactivity of ammonia and additional hazards to be considered are also summarized in the IIAR data book.  While ammonia does react with some chemicals, these are not typically found in or around the CO2 plant or in the process.  The plant operating procedures provide information on the key operating limits for the process.  Plant operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAir Liquide America L.P. has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and control.  Within this program a PHA shall be completed for each new and/or major modified facility or process prior to the initial startup or re-start.

These procedures are reviewed periodically by the operators and annually certified as current and accurate. \n\nTraining\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the Woodriver CO2 plant has implemented a formal training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive training on general orientation, site rules and practices, familiarization with the site, use of safety procedures and equipment, accident investigation and emergency procedures.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.
