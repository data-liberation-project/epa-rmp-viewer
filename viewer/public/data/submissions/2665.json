      "SummaryText": "The North Meridian Water Treatment Plant is located on the north west side of Meridian.  Construction of this facility was finished in 1998.  It has four full-time employees.  This facility houses less than 20,000 pounds of chlorine in one ton containers.  A leak detection system is in place to alarm with audio and visual devices at the detection of 1PPM of chlorine released into the atmosphere.  The Meridian Fire Department (Class 4)  along with the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency are equipped to respond to chemical emergencies at this location.\n\nIn a worst case release of Approximately 200 pounds/minute for ten minutes, residents in a 1.3 mile radius would have to be evacuated.  In the case of a much smaller leak such as a broken supply line that released approximately 74 pounds in two minutes approximately 30 area resident would have to be evacuated.  This kind of a leak is very unlikely because of daily inspection and preventive maintenance that is performed. \n\nThis plant has been operating since early 1998 and has not had any accidental releases of chlorine."
