The facility does currently have a trained HazMat Team to respond offensively to a chlorine release.  Representatives from the facility are actively involved in meetings with outside responders, such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect the surrounding public and environment.  Our facility and the regulated substances handled:  The Aleris facility produces recycled secondary specification aluminum alloys.  The facility has a Program 3 covered process due to onsite storage and use of chlorine.  Chlorine is used to remove magnesium and impurities from molten aluminum.  The general accidental release prevention programand chemical-specific prevention steps:  The facility is covered by EPA's Risk Management Program rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the process using chlorine.  The facility implements one combined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written management system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the chlorine system.  Both the worst case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure, therefore, the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases.  The facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to implement preventive maintenance, testing and inspection of the chlorine system. The five year accident history:  The facility has not had releases of chlorine in the past five years.  The emergency response program:  The facility does currently have a Ha"

The plant has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Wabash County Emergency Management Agency and conducted a mock disaster exercise several years ago.  In the event of a release which could result in an offsite impact, the Emergency Management Agency will be contacted to alert the general public.  The facility has constructed a building for storage and distribution of chlorine (2011).  A dry scrubber and ventilation system has been installed with the building to capture and control potential releases from inside the building.  New sensors/monitors for chlorine have been installed. Planned changes to improve safety:  To improve ambient temperature controls in the vaporizer room to address conditions caused by extreme heat.  To install a video camera system to allow for improved observation/visual monitoring of the chlorine storage building.  The facility will continue to make improvements as identified through our employee participation and internal auditing programs.  "
