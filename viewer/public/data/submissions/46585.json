The chlorine is used only for treating the cooling tower water.  The chlorine station at CT 137 is equipped with chlorine sensors and a water deluge system.  The main purpose of the deluge system is for fire mitigation, not reduction of a chlorine footprint.  The chlorine station is located off site of the unit boundary and is maintained by unit operators.  The unit is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management.",

Port Arthur is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC.  The two members of Chevron Phillips Chemical LLC are ChevronTexaco Corporation and ConocoPhillips Petroleum Company.   Both ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips are international petroleum and chemical companies.\n\nThe Port Arthur Plant employs approximately 210 full time equivalent employees.  This facility is managed by Mr. Richard Cuneo, Plant Manager.   Mr. Ralph Edwards, Compliance Manager, is responsible for RMP implementation for this site.  \n\nJefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (409-722-4371) is the primary organization responsible for coordinating emergency response operations for this area.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is an active member of this organization.  Chevron Phillips Chemical is also a member of Sabine Neches Chiefs Association, a mutual assistance emergency response organization dedicated to providing fire protection and safety management resources to the petrochemical industry of Jefferson County.  In the event of a major release of any hazardous substance or a fire, Chevron Phillips Chemical would coordinate emergency response with these groups as well as the appropriate governmental agencies.     \n\nThis facility uses light hydrocarbon feedstocks purchased from refineries to make the following products: Cyclohexane, Ethylene, Propylene, Butadiene and RPG.  This facility consists of three process units designed to make these products.  Greater than threshold quantities of regulated flammable mixtures are found in this plant, which includes: methane, hydrogen, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, butenes, butanes, pentenes, and pentanes.  Chlorine is the only toxic regulated substance found in greater than threshold quantity, and is only used at the two cooling towers.  Both c"

The main purpose of the deluge system is for fire mitigation, not reduction of a chlorine footprint.   \n\nThis facility includes (3) RMP covered processes, that we have identified as the Ethylene Unit (EU 1544), Cyclohexane Unit (CU 1741), and the Cumene Feed Prep Unit (CFPU 1740).  The Cumene Feed Prep, Cyclohexane, and Ethylene unit's, utilize chlorine in greater than threshold quantities at the CT 294 and CT 137 areas, respectively.  The (3) processes also contain mixtures of flammable regulated substances in greater than threshold quantities and are classified as Prevention Program 3 facilities.     \n\nThis facility is covered by OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.  We are in substantial compliance with the PSM regulations.  This facility is also covered by numerous EPA and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regulatory requirements designed to limit the impact on the environment.  We are also in compliance with these regulations.  \n\nWe have had no RMP reportable accidents for any RMP regulated substances in the past 5 years at the Port Arthur Plant.\n \nChevron Phillips Chemical is constantly reviewing our plant's physical facilities and operations to maintain a safe place for our employees to work and to minimize environmental impacts.  Although we have adopted a program of continuous improvement, at this time, we currently have no plans to implement any major changes to our plant design, operating procedures, or safety systems.  The facility continually uses the MOC / PSSR and PHA processes, to implement and evaluate changes to the equipment and chemical processes, and to determine if change will occur to the Alternative or Worst Case Release scenarios that have been previously identified."
