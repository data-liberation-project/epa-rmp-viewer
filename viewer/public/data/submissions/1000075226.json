INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, environmental, and regulatory responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. \n\n\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \n\n \n\n\n\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nWe use two regulated substances at our facility in a quantity regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and 3M contributes to their safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance programs. \n\n\n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cordova - 3M Company:                                                                                   \n\n- Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-flammable corrosive acid, which is a key raw material used for products to replace ozone-depleting "

PROGRAM TO  PREVENT ACCIDENTAL RELEASES\n\n\n\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental releases as required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right To Know regulations.\n\n\n\nSome of the process controls we have at Cordova - 3M Company are; vents, relief and check valves, scrubbers, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency power, grounding equipment, rupture disks, purge systems, recycled cooling water, refrigeration and, building air pressure to act as secondary containment.  Mitigation systems in use are: sprinkler systems, dikes, fire and blast walls, neutralization, deluge systems, fire hoses, water cannons, dilution fans, blowdown tanks, flame arrestors and emergency squad.  Additionally, we have process area detectors, roof cameras and fluoride monitors.\n\n \n\nBeyond government requirements, we have our own standards for continuously improving safety at our plant.  Following is a brief description of the steps we take to prevent accidental releases:\n\n\n\n   4.1 STORAGE VOLUME REDUCTION - At Cordova - 3M Company, we examine opportunities to reduce the volume of chemicals stored on our site, thereby reducing the potential impact of an accident involving those chemicals.\n\n\n\n    4.2  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION - At Cordova - 3M Company, we maintain a record of safety information that helps us conduct our operations safely. This information describes the chemical hazar"

The information is used in process training for employees and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The information is reviewed periodically for any appropriate improvements and updated as required.\n\n\n\n    4.3  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS - With the support of 3M specialists, we conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that potential hazards associated with certain hazardous processes are identified and controlled effectively.  A team of qualified personnel conducts these studies with expertise in engineering and process operations. These studies are revalidated at regular intervals of no more than five years or whenever significant changes are made in affected operations.  Findings from the hazard analysis are presented so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n    4.4 OPERATING PROCEDURES - To run our manufacturing processes safely, we maintain written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. \n\n\n\n    4.5 TRAINING - At Cordova - 3M Company, we have a comprehensive training program to ensure that employees who are operating hazardous processes understand and are well trained in the correct operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided. \n\n\n\n    4.6  MECHANICAL INTEGRITY - We conduct and document maintenance checks on hazardous process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes, but is not limited to; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and instrumentation, and pumps. Qualified personnel that have been trained in maintenance practices or other specialized subjects, conduct maintenance operations.    Equipment deficiencies are identified "

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other appropriate employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and provided any needed training. \n\n\n\n    4.8 PRE-STARTUP REVIEWS - These safety reviews for new processes and modifications to established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cordova - 3M Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing certain equipment into operation. \n\n\n\n    4.9 COMPLIANCE AUDITS - Utilizing accepted audit practices, we regularly conduct audits to determine whether the procedures identified above are being properly implemented. Required corrections are identified.\n\n\n\n   4.10 INCIDENT INVESTIGATION - We have procedures to investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a substantial release of a regulated substance.  Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future. \n\n\n\n   4.11 EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - At Cordova - 3M Company, we have found through experience that managing process safety and preventing accidents are team efforts.  All Cordova - 3M Company employees particpate in Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs),  Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews (PSSRs) and corrective actions.

Contractors are also informed of 3M procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.   \n\n\n\n5. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nAt Cordova - 3M Company, no level of accident is acceptable.  We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations.  The Cordova site has experienced no off-site impact events involving RMP chemicals listed in this plan in the past five years.\n\n\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\n3M's first line of defense against accidents is to take action to prevent them, as described elsewhere in this executive summary.  However, at Cordova - 3M Company we also work to ensure that we are prepared for any accident that might happen. We maintain a written emergency response plan that includes arrangements for immediate response from employees, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \n\n\n\nWe conduct regular drills-including joint training with the Cordova Fire Department and other local emergency response agencies - to ensure the proper execution of our plan.  Our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Also, Cordova - 3M Company has a fully trained emergency squad on site at all time.\n\n\n\nCordova - 3M Company also participates in the ACC (American Chemistry Council) Responsible Care Program.\n\n\n\n7.
