The City of Sanford Water Treatment Facilities fall under thes rules because they exceed the threshold for chlorine. Thus, to conform with RMP regulations (FR.61 {120}, pg. 31688); the City of Sanford Facilities must meet the following RMP requirements by June 21, 2004.\n\n*Hazard Assessment\n*Prevention Program\n*Emergency Repsonse Program\n*Risk Management Plan (RMPlan)\n\nThe City of Sanford Utility Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and mangement practices. All applicable procedure of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program adhered to.  The emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response requirements.\n\nThe City of Sanford Main Water Plant is located at 3701 Country Club Road, Sanford. It has a design capacity of 10.51 Million Gallons Daily (MGD). The drinking water supply is taken from the Floridan Aquifer and has similar quality to many supplies in Central Florida. The treatment process generally consists of aeration and chlorination.\n\nChlorine is widely used not only for treating municipal and industrial water and wastewater supplies but also in the production "

The gas has a pungent odor detectable at concentrations of less than 1 ppm. A few breaths of 1000 ppm chlorine in the air is likely to be fatal.\n\nChlorine gas is used in the final stages of the water treatment process for the purpose of disinfection. At the Main Water Plant, gaseous chlorine is continuously fed to the Chlorine Contact Chamber to achieve a 1.5 to 2.0 ppm residual total chlorine level in the effluent.  Typically, about 30 pounds per day of chlorine is used for every 1.0 MGD of effluent.\n\nBecause chlorine poses a serious health risk if released to the atmosphere, chlorine is fed from one-ton containers through a fail-safe device called a chlorinator. A chlorinator ystem includes two main components, a vacuum regulator which mounts directly to the upper gas valve of the one-ton chlorine container by means of a lead gasketed poistive yoke assembly, and an ejector which uses  effluent flow to create the necessary vacuum. From the ejector the chlorine gas mixes with the effluent before injected into the chlorine contact chamber through a diffuser. The feed system from the container to the ejector is operated under vacuum, so any small leaks pull in air instead of releasing chlorine.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identifiedas \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\", due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released by EPA of 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines"

The offsite consequences analysis for this scenario was performed for release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 as the the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population rresiding within full circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequences analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n(1) Only a fraction (about 26% of the total) of the compresses liquified chlorine released to the atmosphere flashes as a vapor.  The remaining un-flashed liquid forms liquid forms liquid-droplet aerosols. This results in the formation of a a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly differnct than for a cloud consisting only of chlorine gas.\n(2) It is not appropriate to compar a 10-minute release to a one-hour aaverage standard.  The 3 ppm one-hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten minutes release time; the value obtained is 7.3 ppm.\n(3) Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downsind of the release point is potentially affected.
