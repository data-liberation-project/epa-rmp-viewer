Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Vandalia Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass RETAIL FERTILIZER and AG CHEMICAL SALES.  We have 1 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances is Anhydrous Ammonia.  The regulated substances at our facility is used for Agricultural fertilizer.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 130,000 lb..\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenariosand alternative cases we have used  The Fertilizer Institutes'  DEGADIS model for Worst-Case Ammonia Release.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Bulk Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 130,000lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.6 "

The scenario involves the release of 11908lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 2 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include excess flow valve(s) and neutralization.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200ppm of Ammonia is 1.2 miles.\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility rountinely conducts facility inspections to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The inpections are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. maintains written operating procedures.

Refresher training is provided at least yearly and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at SERVICE AND SUPPLY COOPERATIVE INC..
