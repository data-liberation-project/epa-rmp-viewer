      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nRumford Power Associates, Rumford, ME\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy at Rumford Power is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Rumford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nRumford Power is a combined cycle cogeneration power plant. The regulated substances handled here are: Anhydrous Ammonia used as a refrigerant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency. Aqueous Ammonia is used as a catalyst to control nitrogen oxides (NOx). Approximately 55,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia is used in the \"Chiller System\" and 93,000 pounds of Aqueous Ammonia is used in the injection system and is stored in an above ground storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver in the Chiller System. This facility is located in a rural area and there may be off-site consequences in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Rumford Power are to comply with EPA's accidental prevention rule, OSHA's process safety management rule, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each system and equipment at Rumford Power is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nRumford Power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\nThe emergency response program at Rumford Power is to contact the Rumford Fire Department. It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familiar with our systems and materials.\n\nCurrently there are no plans to revise existing safety programs being administered at Rumford Power."
