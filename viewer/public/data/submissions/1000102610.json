Chlorine is considered hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). NTMWD is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is important to an accidental release prevention program that includes areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the chlorine storage and feed processes at the WTP. It is NTMWD policy to comply with applicable Federal and state rules and regulations including completion of comprehensive updates to its Risk Management Program every five years, or as needed to reflect changes to the WTP chlorine process.\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\nOne regulated substance, chlorine, is used at the Leonard WTP to disinfect treated drinking water. The maximum WTP inventory of chlorine at any time is two 40-ton containers at an 85% fill level, or approximately 13,650 gallons.\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo evaluate the worst-case scenario, we have used EPA\u0092s RMP Guidance for Water Treatment Plants and the RMP*Comp web-based application. \nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest chlorine storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (one 40-ton tank at 85% full) would release 6,825 gallons of chlorine. It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor in an indoor setting within 10 minutes of tank failure. A rural setting was chosen as the topographical setting. Under worst-case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 13 miles corresponding to an endpoint concentration of 0.0087 milligrams per li"

The endpoint basis is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2), developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.\nAlternative Release Scenario - Multiple alternative scenarios were evaluated to simulate a chlorine hose failure. As in the worst-case scenario, a rural topographical setting was chosen. The maximum distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/L or 3 ppm (v/v) is 0.7 miles.\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nNTMWD has taken the necessary steps to comply with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule requirements as specified in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68). Chlorine unloading takes place outdoors and the chlorine storage tanks are located indoors.  While future plant construction includes building an enclosure around the chlorine unloading area, this RMP document including Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the Off-Site Consequence Analysis, and other documentation, reflects current conditions. \nA vacuum chlorine gas feed system automatically stops the flow of chlorine in the event of a piping or valve failure. Leonard WTP operators are competent in the chlorine system operations and are trained in the hazards and operating procedures associated with the chlorine processes.\n\nA summary of NTMWD chlorine process recommended action items is attached as a list in this section. These action items capture the results of the RMP checklist inspection conducted on May, 17, 2022.\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nThe Leonard WTP is scheduled to go on-line in 2022, therefore is no current accident history. \n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\nEmergency response by Leonard WTP employees is limited to minor, incidental releases only. The plant has coordinated emergency response actions with the Leonard Fire Department and the emergency dispatcher. The Emergency Action Plan is re"
