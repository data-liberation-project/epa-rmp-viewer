This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases.

Amylu is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is Amylu\u0092s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility, in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and vi"

The facility produces sausage for retail sales. The NAICS code for the process at the facility is 311999.  Many areas of the facility are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the manufacturing and storage areas.\n\nAmylu utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. One closed loop refrigeration system is utilized to maintain temperature in the manufacturing, dock, and storage coolers. Amylu has a total of 13,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite. \n\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\n\nIV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst-case release scenario. \n\nV.\tHazard Assessment \u0096 Alternative Release Scenario (ARS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternate scenario.

However, as discussed throughout this document Amylu is continuously improving this program. \n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented.
