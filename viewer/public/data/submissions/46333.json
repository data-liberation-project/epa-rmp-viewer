The Plant and ConocoPhillips have a safety record that is consistently among the very best in the energy industry in the United States.  To help ensure the safety of ConocoPhillips operations, the company invests significant resources in accident prevention.  Accident prevention includes designing safe plants and operating facilities, conducting and providing safety training for employees and contractors, and developing and implementing safe work practices and procedures for the operation and maintenance of plants, processes, and operations facilities.  ConocoPhillips policies and dedication to safety and environmental stewardship help to prevent accidental releases.  If, despite our best attempts to prevent such incidents, a release should occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release in accordance with the plant's Incident Response Plan.  \n \n    This document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's new Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), which were promulgated in the Federal Register on Thursday, June 20, 1996, Vol. 61, No. 120.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility, located in Chambers County, Texas, is owned by three partners, ConocoPhillips Co., Targa Resources, and Devon Energy, and operated by the ConocoPhillips L48.  The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility is a natural gas liquids processing plant which receives raw product by pipeline.  The facility operates two fractionation trains which extract hydrocarbon liquids from the raw natural gas streams.  The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility operation includes inlet metering, compression, ethane treating, butane and gasoline treating, fractionation and product storage.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline.\n    \n    In accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations (40 CFR "

[Note: The term \"threshold quantity\" is the quantity above which the EPA has decided that the substance will be regulated.]  Our evaluation determined that the following listed flammable substances are handled by the plant in quantities above the substance's threshold quantity: propane, natural gasoline, n-butane, isobutane, and ethane.  [Note:  Natural gasoline is exempt from threshold determination provisions of the regulation based on its National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 3.]  There are no toxic substances above the threshold quantity at the plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility does not have any toxic substances above threshold quantity. As the plant does not have any toxic substances, toxic release scenarios were not addressed.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the worst-case release scenario, which the regulations define as the \"release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure.?  For flammables, this hypothetical worst case assumes an instantaneous release and a vapor cloud explosion.  These assumptions are required without regard to whether a scenario is realistic or improbable.  Propane was used in the model for the hypothetical worst-case flammable scenario.  The worst-case scenario was modeled on the assumption of the instantaneous release of all of the propane in the largest propane vessel. Under the stipulated guidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited, would have an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is EPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance document.]\n\nPassive mitigation systems were not app"

We believe that a vessel failure such as this is extremely unlikely because the vessels are carefully designed with significant engineering safety factors.  In addition, all pressure vessels are carefully inspected and pressure tested before they are placed in service, and the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility follows a rigorous Mechanical Integrity Program to ensure that all process equipment is properly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage or failure.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe RMP regulations require the operator to model a single ?alternative release scenario? for all regulated flammable substances.  For the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility, this hypothetical scenario was modeled on the basis of a seal failure on the ethane pipeline pump, which was assumed to last for ten minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as leak detection gas detection and emergency shutdown systems would enable the plant to isolate and eliminate such a release within that time-frame.  The alternative release scenario has off-site impact as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance. \n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n    AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility adheres to the policies and procedures provided in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These policies and procedures include and embrace the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n    The following is a general overview of the main elements of the Risk Management Program that are currently in operation at the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility.

The team also evaluates potential mitigation measures and accident prevention measures for each potential process hazard at the facility.  The final part of the procedure requires the team to make specific suggestions for management consideration to address or mitigate each identified hazard.\n\nThe PHA team's findings and suggestions are provided to plant management for further evaluation and resolution.  All approved mitigation options are then tracked as part of the process until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards are continuously evaluated and maintained in a safe condition, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the Process Hazard Analysis.  These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years and will continue at this frequency as long as the plant is in operation.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n    The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility maintains a variety"

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n    The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility developed and maintains written operating procedures that provide plant operators with a clear understanding of the tasks involved in the safe operation of the facility.  Operating procedures that address various modes of process operations are maintained, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent training of new operators, and they provide good reference materials for experienced operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. Whenever a process modification is made, the procedures are revised as appropriate to cover the modification.  The procedures are kept current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nThese procedures are used in employee training, and are readily available to employees to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility employs a comprehensive training program for all employees at the plant.

They are thereby trained in the specific knowledge, skills, and procedures needed to safely conduct their work.  In addition, each operator receives facility-specific training on how to operate the plant, including detailed training on the operating procedures, including startup, shutdown, normal operations, temporary operations, and emergency operations.  As part of this training, an operator in training is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstration) the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, only then can they work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at a high level.  This refresher training is provided as often as necessary, and no less than every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\n    The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility uses contractors to perform many project-specific activities and supplement the plant workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction periods.  For those contractors who work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place, that when followed, ensure that these contractors:\n    \n?    perform their work in a safe manner, \n?    have the appropriate knowledge and skills to work safely around the process,\n?    are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n?    understand what they should do in the event of an incident,\n?    understand and follow site safety rules, and\n?    inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that their work brings and/or that they find during their work.\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility has developed and implemented s"

ConocoPhillips personnel periodically monitor contractor safety programs and performance records.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n    Throughout the life of any operating facility, changes will often be necessary -- for example, to meet changing circumstances, to make needed improvements, or to alter the technology of the process.  The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility has a comprehensive system in place to manage and document any such changes to the plant's processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, or other changes be properly reviewed and authorized by a number of people with different functional expertise before being implemented.  This system of managing facility modifications is called Management of Change (MOC).  This system consists of a set of written procedures that are used to identify and eliminate hazards associated with a change to the facility's processes.  MOC ensures that facility modifications are formally reviewed and approved before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been negatively affected by the change.  A part of the MOC process ensures that any chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment in"

A critical piece of the MOC process ensures that operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training regarding the process modification.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure before startup of the modified process or unit that the modification was completed in accordance with design specifications.  The PSSR is also intended to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are properly prepared for startup before the modified equipment is put in service.  Another key purpose of the PSSRs is to ensure that all personnel have been trained on the modification, including any revisions to the operating procedures or to the safety systems and controls.  This review provides one additional check to make sure that all personnel and supporting systems are operationally ready to operate the newly-modified process or equipment.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction, and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention, Process Safety Management Program, and Risk Management Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n    The Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain process equipment in a safe operating condition.  This mechanical integrity program includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems, among other items.

In addition to being used in training, written procedures are intended to ensure that maintenance work is performed in a consistent manner.  \n\nInspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAn integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nAs part of the design and startup of the facility, the Gulf Coast Fractionators Facility developed safe work practices designed to ensure worker and process safety and these safe work practices are followed to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.
