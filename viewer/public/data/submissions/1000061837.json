The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases. \r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.  \r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 8890 ND-30 in Mylo, North Dakota (the facility). Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure. There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 30,000 gallons.  There are also approximately 10 nurse tanks at the location each with a capacity of approximately 1,500 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is routinely filled to 85% capacity. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into the 1,500 gallon nurse tanks. A maximum total of 10 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time. The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has deve"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment. The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps. \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use. Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility. Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Rolla Fire Department (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\r\n\r\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases.\r\n2. Information on emergency health care.\r\n3.
