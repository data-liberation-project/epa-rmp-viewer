Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nBased on 2017 Compliance Audit, Mermentau Facility is NOT subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA\u2019s) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119).
