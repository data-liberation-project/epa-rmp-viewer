KFE's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKFE produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is also injected into a pipeline to be transported to distribution terminals. \n\n\n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, a urea production unit, and a UAN unit.  Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station and a hydrogen recovery unit (HRU).  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production unit.  Urea Formaldehyde is injected into the process to produce granulated urea.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.   \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Managem"

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThis submittal is required due to an expansion of the A1 Unit, which resulted in a hazard and operability study for the project.  40 CFR 68.190(b)(5) requires an RMP update within six months of a change that requires a revised PHA or hazard review.  All nine sections of the RMP are being updated for this submittal.  No significant changes were made to the RMP. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KFE.  These high standards include:\n\n\n\n-    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n\n-    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n-    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n-    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nKFE is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program has involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\n\n-    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\n\n-    Testing and Inspection of vessels through the Mechanic"

They occurred in January 2013, December 2013 and March 2014.  Additional information for each incident is provided in the RMP Data Elements. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for KFE with the Enid Fire Department, the Garfield County Sheriff, and the Garfield County LEPC.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center.  The KFE Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
