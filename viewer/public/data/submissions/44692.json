      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan (RMP) was developed for the use and storage of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at the Wells' Dairy North Ice Cream Plant in Le Mars, Iowa.\nThe RMP program was established to meet and address the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68).  This Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance\nThe five year accident history\nThe employee awareness and responder training programs\nThe accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention efforts\nThe emergency response program and it's integration with local emergency response plans\nThe programs to continually improve safety and reduce risk of accidental releases.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the Wells' Dairy North Ice Cream Plant refrigeration system.  Liquid is circulated as needed to the air handling units and production chillers and freezers, where the heat is absorbed and removed from the medium being cooled or frozen.  The anhydrous ammonia system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nThe five year accident history contains two incidents where an amount less than a reportable quantity of gaseous ammonia was released to the atmosphere due to equipment failure.  As a precautionary measure for the first incident, local responders where summoned to assist with public concerns due to the very low detection levels of the general public.  For the second incident, the majority of the released ammonia was contained in the process drain system and treated in the wastewater treatment plant.  No medical, evacuation, or shelter-in-place actions were required due to the very low concentrations in the exposure area.  At no time was anyone exposed to ammonia concentrations at or even near the IDLH concentration.\n\nChemical awareness training is provided to all employees at the faci"

      "SummaryText": "lity.  For those employees that are designated to respond to emergencies, intensive training, testing and certificationare completed on an accelerated schedule.  These employees are trained in the use of proper personal protective equipment, incident command, and spill control as well as other emergency response topics.  Periodic skill demonstration drills are conducted throughout the year.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program level 3 is emplemented through the process safety management (PSM) program. Process specific training is provided to all maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained throughout the life of the process.  Administrative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention progams can be modified accordingly.  The various facets of PSM and RMP are linked through documentation and communication.\n\nEmergency response plans for various personnel and chemical emergencies are integrated into an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP documents the processes of emergency response, training, resource management, and data tracking for a wide range of accident or emergencies that may occur at this facility.  The ICP also spells out the line of authority for personnel that may need to respond to accident or emergencies.  Training is provided to on-site emergency responders as well as local fire department personnel that may be asked to assist in the case of an accident.
