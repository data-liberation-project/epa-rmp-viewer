IF AN ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\nTHE  PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION  AS A CROP NUTRIENT. \n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 56,000 POUNDS.\n\n\n3.  THE WORSE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nTHE WORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE  56,000   POUNDS, WICH REPRESENT THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS .74 MILES.\n\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.\n\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO IS  .19 MILES. THIS RELEASE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING BEYOND THE FACILITY BOUNDARY.\n\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\nTHIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S   ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF  SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN STANDARDS  INSTITUT"
