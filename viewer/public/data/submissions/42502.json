      "SummaryText": "Anadarko E&P Company LP\nTable Rock Gas Processing Plant \nExecutive Summary\n\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nAnadarko E&P Company LP, a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation owns and operates the Table Rock Gas Processing Plant located in Sweetwater County Wyoming, U.S.A.  The Table Rock Gas Processing Plant operates a variety of processes to produce sweet natural gas and condensate from the inlet stream.  The plant also produces ammonium thiosulfate, a fertilizer product, using the hydrogen sulfide recovered from the natural gas sweetening unit and anhydrous ammonia. Both hydrogen sulfide and anhydrous ammonia are regulated toxic substances which are present in an amount greater than the threshold quantities. Propane, a regulated flammable substance, is used as a refrigerant in the natural gas dew point control system.  The plant usually stores propane in an amount above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nOFFISTE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nDue to security concerns, Anadarko has elected not to include details of the offsite consequence analysis results in this Executive Summary.  This information can be made available to EPA, State and local emergency personnel upon request.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen sulfide processes qualify as Program 3 RMP because the worst case scenarios reach off-site receptors.  The propane process qualifies as Program 1 RMP because the worst case scenario does not reach any off-site receptors.  The Table Rock Gas Processing Plant has not had an accident in the pase five years.  The plant has an active and up-to-date emergency response plan.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Table Rock Gas Processing Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.
