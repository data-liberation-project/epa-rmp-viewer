DyStar manufactures more than 100 chemical products.\n\n\n\nDyStar's Cincinnati facility produces a variety of products including colorants and chemicals used to produce pigment dispersions for paints and inks, dyes for technical applications, food colors, cosmetic colors, and specialty products. The DyStar plant location has been manufacturing in Cincinnati since 1922. DyStar's Cincinnati manufacturing processes utilize one chemical as a raw material in a quantity that is regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule. The 65% Oleum is used in a sulfonation process, and is classified as a toxic under the RMP. \n\n\n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nPOLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nIt is the intent of DyStar Hilton Davis Corporation to comply with all requirements established by applicable safety, health and environmental regulations promulgated by Federal and State agencies. \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nDyStar has in place an ongoing process safety management (PSM) program. This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur. DyStar has invested and continues to invest substantial effort and capital in maintaining a strong safety and environmental performance. Elements of the PSM program include:\n\n\n\n(1) Process Hazard Analyses - routinely performed with systematic and thorough studies of our operations to identify what could go wrong, identify means of eliminating or"

Designs include, as appropriate, emergency shutdown systems, pressure relief devices, ventilation systems, and release sensing systems. Storage vessels, which contain the greatest inventories of hazardous chemicals, are contained in concrete dikes and mainly indoors. (3) Training - operations and maintenance personnel are trained on their job tasks, on safe work practices as they apply to their jobs, and emergency contingency actions, before they may operate or maintain equipment. They also receive refresher training periodically and when changes occur. Procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices and emergency response, are documented and maintained up to date in light of any changes at the plant.\n\n\n\n(4) Maintenance - each item of equipment at in the Oleum process that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\n\n\n\n(5) Management of Change - changes to equipment or procedural practices can only take place at the plant after a review of the implications of that change to safety. No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility has NOT had any events that qualify for inclusion in the RMP 5-year accident history. This performance reflects the positive impact that our ongoing preventative process safety programs have had on the safe handling of hazardous chemicals at this plant site.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDyStar has in place a written emergency response plan for responding to an Oleum spill.

Under that prescription we have identified a WCS. It involves a large indoor spill of Oleum. Based on use of the worst case release , this scenario is calculated to have offsite impacts. A more credible scenario, called an alternative release scenario (ARS), was also analyzed.In the unlikely event of an Oleum leak at the storage tank, the facility incorporated a portable foam spray system has been developed to blanket any spill to greatly reduce off-site exposure.\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP Rule, a hypothetical ARS was chosen that is severe enough to have effect beyond the facility fence line. The selected ARS is a highly unlikely scenario of the type the process safety management program protects against. The ARS involves the rupture of a flexible hose during the transfer of Oleum from the delivery tanker into a storage vessel. The spilled liquid begins to evaporate resulting in the production of vapor which, based on the use of EPA modeling tools, is predicted to have impact beyond the fence line. The hypothetical Oleum spill is predicted to disperse sulfur trioxide about 0.9 miles from the tanker. There are several safeguards that protect against this scenario from occurring. First, procedures require that the hoses be thoroughly checked before the hoses are used to transfer liquid. Second, pressure testing of each flexible hose before it is used to transfer a hazardous material. Any leaks or poor connections would be detected during the pressure test. Third, because the operating procedures require an operator to be present during unloading, the operator would in reality tu"
