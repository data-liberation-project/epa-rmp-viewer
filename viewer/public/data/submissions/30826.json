Our Emergency Action Plan applies to the use of chlorine gas in the water treatment process at the Town of Smyrna Water Treatment Plant. The purpose of the plan is to aid the Town of Smyrna in its efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic releases of chlorine that could result in the catastrophic loss of personnel and property within the facility and possibly the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nOur Facility:  The Smyrna Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine gas as its primary disinfectant in the process of treating drinking water. The chlorine is stored approximately 100 yards from the main administration and operations building. The chlorine storage building can contain up to 15 tons of chlorine and is enclosed. The only possible leaks are at the cylinder due to a vacuum-type chlorine system. The storage room has constant video monitoring and a Purafil dry media chlorine scrubber capable of removing two full tons of chlorine gas from the storage room. A constant chlorine monitoring system activates the scrubber and sounds an audible alarm and alarm lighting.\r\n\r\nChlorine presents physical properties and health hazards that would be immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) in the event of an uncontrolled gas release. The following section consists of a review of the inherent physical properties and health hazards associated with chlorine gas for emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\nPhysical Properties:\r\n\r\na.\tAt room temperatures, chlorine is a gas.\r\nb.\tIf chlorine is cooled to 29.3 degrees F, it becomes an amber-colored liquid. It is usually shipped as a liquid in order to save space.\r\nc.\tIf liquid chlorine escapes from a container it will usually be boiling and convert to a greenish-yellow c"

Oxidizer\r\n\r\nHealth Hazards:\r\n\r\na.\tThe minimum detectable odor level of chlorine for most individuals is 0.3 ppm. Chlorine will cause irritation of the upper respiratory system and mucus membranes at 3 to 6 ppm.\r\nb.\tThe TOSHA permissible exposure limit for chlorine is represented by a ceiling value of 1 ppm. NIOSH has assigned an IDLH value of 10 ppm for acute chlorine exposure.\r\nc.\tExposure to skin or eyes can cause serious frostbite burns.\r\nd.\tInhalation of chlorine gas can lead to adverse acute health effects including: irritation of the upper respiratory system, violent coughing, choking, nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath, and pulmonary edema. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\n\r\nChlorine is dropped during loading/unloading/handling resulting in the rupturing of the cylinder or valve stem and the uncontrolled release of the contents of the cylinder. Fire in or near chlorine room allowing fusible plug to melt in cylinder or a faulty fusible plug.\r\n\r\nAlternate Scenario:\r\n\r\nThe yoke on the cylinder valve is defective, malfunctions, or is improperly installed on a chlorine cylinder resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas from the cylinder. The valve packing leaks from a defective chlorine cylinder valve resulting in the limited yet uncontrolled release of gas from the cylinder. The yoke is not properly set and tightened on the cylinder valve. The yoke was not properly cleaned with a wire brush prior to installing the washer.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History: We have had only three"

No one on-site or off-site was injured and no property was damaged.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program, Chlorine Release Hazard Control Measures, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment are used to mitigate the hazards associated with the release of chlorine gas. These hazard control measures were developed and implemented to increase the effectiveness of the emergency response actions and protect emergency response personnel and the public.\r\n\r\nEngineering Controls:\r\n\r\n?\tFixed Chlorine Monitor ? A fixed chlorine monitor is located in the chlorine cylinder storage room and the chlorine feed room. The monitors will detect chlorine at 0 to 5 ppm. The chlorine monitor is connected to the SCADA system to obtain constant readings from the control room. These monitors are connected with the chlorine scrubber and, in the event of a gas release, will cause the system to start up. The monitors are also equipped with audible alarms and lights.\r\n?\tPersonal Chlorine Monitor ? Portable personal chlorine monitors are available for use during response to gas release episodes. The monitors will provide quantification of gas contaminant levels which can be utilized to determine the type of personal protective equipment deemed necessary and zones for evacuation purposes. \r\n?\tAmmonia Solution Leak Testing ? Use an ammonia solution to check for leaks within the chlorine process piping or valves. This is done by discharging ammonia vapor in the area of a possible or suspected leak. If a chlorine gas leak is present, a white-colored cloud will form.\r\n?\tEmergency ?B? Kit ? An Emergency ?B?

Emergency Response Team Members will receive 24 hours of Hazardous Materials Technician training that fully complies with the requirements of TOSHA 1910.120 (q) (6) (iii). The training provides classroom instruction, demonstrations and hands-on application of appropriate response actions for anticipated chlorine release episodes. The personnel training, after receiving initial training, will be supplemented with an annual 8-hour refresher course that will continue their certification on the technician level.\r\n?\tProcess Safety Management Training ? Facility personnel handling chlorine cylinders, performing maintenance on the chlorine system, and operating the system are involved in the Smyrna Water Treatment Plant PSM program and receive training which fully complies with the requirements of TOSHA 1910.119 (g) (1).\r\n?\tBuddy System ? Handling (loading/unloading) of cylinders and maintenance on the process system requires the presence of a minimum of two workers at all times.\r\n?\tDaytime Cylinder Handling ? Unless emergency deems necessary, chlorine cylinders are only handled in the daytime. This safeguard was implemented due to the potential for catastrophic consequences if a cylinder were to fall and rupture and the difficulties which could be associated with attempting to respond to a potential catastrophic release of chlorine during the night time.\r\n?\tProcess Safety Management Program Manual ? A site-specific PSM Program Manual has been developed and implemented for the Smyrna Water Treatment Plant facility. The PSM Program Manual provides identification and evaluation of potential chlorine release scenarios and a review of the safeguards in place to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of a chlorine release.\r\n\r\nPersonal Protective Equipment:\r\n\r\nMost of the Town of Smyrna Water Treatment Plant?s personal protective equipment is located in a HAZMAT Em"
