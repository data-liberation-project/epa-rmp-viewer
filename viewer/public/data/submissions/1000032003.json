Braskem Marcus Hook Polymers has received OSHAs' Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star, which requires a strong, voluntary commitment to the highest Safety standards.\n\nOverall responsibility for safety resides with the Facility Manager.  Management is directly involved in the several Teams that oversee the Safety Programs.   These Teams are composed of a broad cross section of the employees.\n\nThe HES group oversees the implementation of the facility's risk management program.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained volunteer members on duty for all shifts.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nBraskem Marcus Hook Polymers facility manufactures polypropylene, one of the most useful of plastics. It is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous and burns poorly. Polypropylene at Marcus Hook is manufactured from propylene supplied either in railcar or in tank truck. The facility receives varying grades of propylene in truck or railcar that is refined to the purity required for polypropylene manufacture. On-site storage of both refined and unrefined propylene is done in the H-5 and Cavern #4 areas while refining of the propylene is completed in the 15-2 area.\n\nEffective July 1, 2012, Braskem acquired from Sunoco Corporation certain assets associated with propylene production operations at the site, including a propylene unloading rack and other process equipment.  The acquisition of these additional assets did not change the nature of Braskem's operations at the facility, nor introduce a new RMP-regulated substance to the facility's operations. Braskem is updating its RMP to ensure that its planning fully accounts for these additional equipment and process unit.\n\n\n\nPropylene is the major hazardous mater"

Similar to propane in characteristics, it is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration.  It is handled under pressure in both its gaseous and liquid forms. \n\nAs part of the process to ensure propylene is processed to the quality required for propylene manufacture, Braskem also handles Ethane, Ethylene, Hydrogen, Isobutane, Methane and Propane.  With the exception of propane at approximately 10%, all other regulated materials are in volumes less than 0.5% of the propylene volume on site.   \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBraskem's Marcus Hook facility has active Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs.  Various elements of the program are distributed to site personnel, who manage their elements under the coordination of the Facility Manager and Lead Engineer\n\nFacility employees participate in appropriate areas of the PSM/ RM programs such as participating as members of process hazard analysis (PHA) teams, management of change (MOC) reviews, Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews (PSSRs), incident investigations, etc.  The company also works closely with outside agencies, including involving the outside agencies in company training programs.  Some features of the program include:\n\n- OSHA PSM/ EPA Risk Management Program, including:\n\n - Employee Participation\n\n - Process Safety Information\n\n - Process Hazard Analysis\n\n - Operating Procedures\n\n- Personnel Training\n\n- Emergency Response and Planning\n\n - Incident Investigations\n\n - Contractor Compliance Verification\n\n - Mechanical Integrity\n\n - Hot Work Permits\n\n - Management Of Change Procedures\n\n - Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\n - Compliance Audits\n\n- Insurance Provider Inspections and Standards.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAs stated above, on July 1, 2012, Braskem acquired from Sunoco Corporation certain assets associated with propylene production op"

Although Braskem neither owned nor operated such assets prior to this acquisition, for purposes of completing the current update to this RMP plan, Braskem has considered the five year accident history of the propylene unloading rack acquired from Sunoco.  On 6/21/2009, at the unloading rack within the H-5 LPG area, a release of 7400 lbs propylene occurred as a result of a failed hose.   The contractor exposed to propylene during the release was treated with first aid and released.  As a result of the investigation, operational and preventive maintenance procedures were revised.   \n\nContract drivers unload tank trucks at the Braskem facility, and are instructed to follow procedures developed by  Braskem for these activities.  During unloading, pressure switches, LEL alarms, and grounding system interlocks exist to mitigate and prevent releases, and specific hoses designed for the transfers are used to minimize the potential for a release.   At the time of the incident, drivers made unloading connections, and started and stopped transfers from trucks to the Braskem storage tanks in accordance with the Braskem procedure.  \n\nOn October 8, 2013, near the completion of the unloading operation of a tanker truck of propylene/propane mix at Rack 16 in the H5 area, the contract truck driver observed a leak from the Acme fitting where the Braskem hose attaches to the truck outlet.  As he returned to the cab to shut down the transfer to stop the leak, the Acme fitting loosened further and released approximately 1150 pounds of the propylene/propane mix.  The release was ignited by another truck at Rack 15, located next to Rack 16.  As a result of the flash fire, the driver for the truck at Rack 15  suffered second degree burns to the face and hands.  Another driver who was unloading a truck nearby received burns to the face.  Both truck drivers were taken to the Crozer Medical Center for treatment.  \n\nBraskem personnel"

Braskem then undertook an investigation of the incident, and determined that  the engine of the truck at Rack 15 was the ignition source of the fire, as the engine temperature under unloading conditions exceeded that needed to ignite propylene.  As a result of the investigation, operational procedures for unloading propylene, driver qualification and testing of unloading equipment were revised to provide detailed instruction to Braskem and contract drivers  to govern activities both prior to and during unloading operations.\n\nSimilarly, to the extent that the prior owner of the process operation conducted any relevant evaluation, including a process hazard assessment, with respect to the process, Braskem regards such evaluation as continuing to apply to the process operation, since the equipment and process activities have (for purposes relevant to RMP) been retained in all material respects since the date of Braskem's ownership.  Therefore, in providing within this electronic submittal information responsive to specific inquiries regarding prior dates on which certain relevant events occurred, Braskem identifies, where appropriate, the date of such event even if prior to Braskem's initial ownership to the extent that such event or activity remains relevant for RMP purposes to Braskem's on-going operation of the regulated process.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nThe facility utilizes a number of monitoring, detection, and suppression systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate fires and releases of hazardous materials.
