KHLP?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the plant, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the plant and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Isomerization Plant is one of many facilities owned and operated by KHLP.  At the Isomerization Plant, butane is received by pipeline and converted into isobutane.  The isobutane is shipped out by pipeline.  Propane is received by rail and truck, then purified in molecular sieves.  The purified propane is shipped out of the facility by rail and truck.  Demethanized raw feed is received via railcar and sent on to a gas fractionation plant for further processing and sale.  Hydrogen is stored at the facility; however, the amount is below the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nPropane, butane, isobutane, and a flammable mixture (demethanized raw feed) consisting of ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Isomerization Plant in amounts above threshold quantity. There are no RMP toxic chemicals present at the plant.  Sodium hydroxide and "

The plant is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \n\n \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the plant are part of the high standards striven for by KHLP.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n?Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the plant.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Isomerization Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this plant include:\n\n\n?Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire detectors and gas detectors throughout the plant to detect flames.\n?Minimizing the possibility of fire by providing fire water monitors throughout the plant for fire fighting.\n?Monitoring all the storage tanks and vessels for pressure, temperature, and liquid level.  Providing high and low level alarms, high pressure alarms, and high temperature alarms on all the storage tanks and process vessels.. \n?Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n?Providing"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the McPherson County LEPC.  The Isomerization Plant Manager or designee is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the plant is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanica"
