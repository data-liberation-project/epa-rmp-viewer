The maximum quantity stored would be an occasional railcar with 160,000 pounds, and 56,000 pounds in one of our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks. \n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario\na.)The worst-case scenario would be the release of the entire contents of a railcarand one storage tank, released as a gas in a span of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 216,000 pounds, which represents the loaded quantity of a railcar and one storage tank.   The distance to the endpoint is 3.4 miles.\nb.)The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.4 of a mile.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\nThe facility has implemented the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)29CFR1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia \"\n\n5.The Five Year Accident History\na.)There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that:\n   -Have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n   -To our knowledge, have resulted in other deaths, injuries, evacuations,  sheltering in place property \n     damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
