      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nTXU Electric's overall approach to accident prevention and risk management is as follows:\n\nTXU Electric is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  TXU Electric has implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at its facilities.  If there is an accidental release, TXU Electric will either provide, or request from others, immediate emergency response to minimize the effect of the release. TXU Electric will also immediately notify the public, through county emergency management agencies, of any actions necessary to ensure public protection.\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\nMonticello Steam Electric Station (MOSES) is an electric generating plant using fossil fuel (coal) as an energy source.  The coal is burned in large boilers to produce steam, which is used as the motive force for the TXU turbine generators. TXU Electric takes great care in reducing emissions from burning coal to the greatest extent possible by injecting. an ammonia/air mixture into the pollution control devices (electrostatic precipitators and baghouses).  The ammonia reacts with sulfur dioxide present in the emission (flue gas) stream and acts to agglomerate the ash creating a larger particle size and improving performance of the pollution control devices.\nTXU Electric uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) at MOSES.  It is purchased as a compressed liquefied gas in bulk from commercial suppliers and fed to vaporizers where the liquid is converted to a gas and then injected into the flue gas streams. There are two separate ammonia systems at MOSES, each with an 18,000 gallon storage tank. Inventory is controlled to a maximum of 84,067 pounds of ammonia in each tank.  This inventory exceeds the "

As required by the RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as a ten-minute release of the greatest quantity of the regulated substance contained in any single vessel or pipeline.  For MOSES this greatest quantity is the 84,067-pound maximum inventory of the ammonia storage tank.  Consequently, the worst-case release is 8,410 pounds per minute of ammonia for ten minutes.\n\nThe regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance.  A release dispersion model is used to project the distance to an \"endpoint\" concentration of the released compound.  For the offsite consequence analyses required by the RMP regulations, this endpoint concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The endpoint (ERPG-2 value) established for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L.\n\nFor the rural setting of MOSES, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration for the worst-case release is 4.2 miles.  This distance was obtained from the dispersion modeling software Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres Version 5.2.1 (ALOHA).  ALOHA was developed through a joint effort of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as a tool for emergency responders and emergency plannin"

However, if the worst-case release occurred, only a small fraction of these residents that are located downwind of MOSES would be in the affected area.  Other public receptors within the 4.2-mile radius include churches and recreational lakes and park areas.  There are no hospitals, prisons, or major office or industrial areas within this impact area. The only environmental receptor (i.e., national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas) within the impact area is Lake Bob Sandlin State Recreation Area.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of storage tanks and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at MOSES.  In fact, release reporting databases and industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nThe alternative release scenario(s).\nIn determining the alternative release scenarios at MOSES, the results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history were used. The PHA assessed the likelihood and expected severity of potential accident scenarios.  The selected alternative release scenarios are presented below:\n\n( Alternative Release Scenario 1\nThe first alternative release scenario involves a vapor release from a pressure relief valve on the storage tank.  This results in a total anhydrous ammonia release of 5,639 pounds over a 1-hour period.\n\n( Alternative Release Scenario 2\nThe Units 1 & 2 and Unit 3 tanks are equ"

This scenario considers any small leak or opening in the line that is just small enough to keep the excess flow valve from seating, or less than 90 gpm. This results in a total anhydrous ammonia release of 30,720 pounds over a 1-hour period.\n\nFor the rural setting of the MOSES, the potential distances to the endpoint concentration for these alternate release scenarios is 0.2 miles and 0.6 miles, respectively.  The maximum impact from all alternative scenarios modeled is approximately 21 residents within this potential impact area; however, only a small fraction of these residents located downwind of the release would typically be in the affected area.  Other public receptors within the maximum distance include a church and park areas.  There are no hospitals, prisons, or major office or industrial areas within this impact area. There are no environmental receptors (i.e., national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and Federal wilderness areas) within the impact area.  As with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather conditions.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, three levels of prevention program requirements have been established to roughly match the level of effort to the risk of off-site impacts.  Because the offsite consequence analysis showed that the worst-case release scenario could impact offsite public receptors, and because the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) is applicable at this facility, TXU Electric's Monticello Steam Electric Station must meet RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements for its ammonia processes.  \n\nTXU Electric has a high level of management commitment to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operat"

Based on this high level commitment, the Plant Generation Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.
