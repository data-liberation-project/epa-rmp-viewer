      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary for the Marsulex Chicago Customer Service Center\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Chicago Customer Service Center are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Chicago Fire Department, in Cook County, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass storage, transfer and shipping of sulfuric acid and the transfer and shipping of liquid sulfur dioxide . We have one (1) regulated substance, sulfur dioxide present at our facility. The regulated substances at our facility are involved in transfer from rail tank cars to truck cargo tankers. \n\nThe maximum inventory of sulfur dioxide that is expected to be present in this facility based on shipping requirements is 540,000 lbs. \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures \nto limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from one 90 ton liquid sulfur dioxide "

      "SummaryText": "rail tank car.  The scenario involves and release of 180,000 lb. sulfur dioxide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 16 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide involves a release of sulfur dioxide from a transfer hose.  The scenario involves the release of 26,800 lb. of sulfur dioxide.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm. from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as Inventory are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of sulfur dioxide is 0.8 miles.\n\n\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-                                       \n       Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The sulfur dioxide processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n The Chicago Customer Service Center maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facili"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three (3) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,  the Chicago Customer Service Center maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n The Chicago Customer Service Center has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.   Refresher training is provided at least every three (3)  years and more frequently as needed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n The Chicago Customer Service Center carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, hoses, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
