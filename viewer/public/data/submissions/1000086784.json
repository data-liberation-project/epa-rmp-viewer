CCI will utilize its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.  CCI will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\r\nCCI has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from its plant at 2220 Industrial Road near Crete, Nebraska. At this location, CCI processes and raw meat products and freezes the products for distribution to pet food manufacturers. The industrial process relies on chillers to keep the food products cold during processing and storage. The chillers and refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the coolant in quantities exceeding EPA's regulatory threshold.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nCCI relies on several safeguards as part of its accidental release prevention program. CCI's designers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components that are installed; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures. Also hazard communication occurs frequently between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and the annual program review.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History \r\nWithin the last 5 years, no accidental releases of ammonia have resulted in deaths, injuri"

The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Saline County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Crete Fire Department and it provides guidance for the notification, response and evacuation of CCI's employees. The emergency action plan acknowledges the LEPC as the emergency coordinators and recognizes the Crete Fire Department as the first responders.\r\n\r\nSafety Improvements \r\nCCI's regular participation in safety training and internal facility safety reviews offered by the Nebraska Safety Council; hosts the local Fire Department during facility walk through, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts third party audits to identify potential improvements, conducts regular pipe integrity testing, and offers CCI employees awareness level, initial and refresher training on the ammonia refrigeration system. This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all CCI employees."
