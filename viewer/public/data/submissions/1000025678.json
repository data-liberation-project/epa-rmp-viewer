These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  \r\n\r\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \r\n\r\nContractors:  Osborne Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Osborne Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

There are no 112(r) threshold\r\ntoxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance,\r\nincluding the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the local fire\r\ndepartment, and mechanisms for notification are in place.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  Osborne Gas Plant has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices:  Osborne Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry / presence / exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.  \r\n\r\nManagement of Change:  Osborne Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Osborne Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. \r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Osborne plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued\r\nsafe operation.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Osborne Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Osborne Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and/or What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

This\r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of\r\npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our\r\nprocesses.  Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable\r\nreleases of regulated flammable substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant\r\npersonnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Osborne plant, located in rural Roberts County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to\r\nrecover petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane) from field gas.  There are no threshold quantities of\r\ntoxic substances present.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Osborne Gas Plant.  The processes at the facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) but are not subject to OSHA PSM.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Osborne Gas Plant's safety program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.
