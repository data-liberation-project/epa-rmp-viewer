The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\n\n3.9. Compliance Audits\nThe facility conducts audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.  The audit includes a review of documentation and process safety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\nThe facility has not had any accidents reportable under RMP in the past five years. This RMP submittal is an update to a previously submitted plan.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\nCardinal maintains a written emergency response program that includes a Health & Safety Plan and a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan (SPCC). The purpose of the Plans is to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. These plans address aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Cardinal has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.

Some of the checks performed during the daily inspection include: check for signs of leakage, corrosion, staining, and odor around all tank bases, valves, test ports, connections, flanges and manways. If an integrity issue is observed or a possible release is noted, it is immediately reported to the facility Supervisor and EH&S Manager.\n\n3.4. Contractors\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to ensure that contractor personnel follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedures include a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training, and safe work permitting that includes hot work and fire prevention.\n\n3.5. Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\nCardinal conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing equipment into service.\n\n3.6. Mechanical Integrity\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes written procedures, training, and regular inspections and equipment testing to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems and controls in safe operating condition.\n\n3.7. Management of Change\nCardinal\u2019s management of change (MOC) program reviews all proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions prior to implementation of the change.

Process Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP PHA methodology. The PHA identified potential major hazards, including toxic gas release, flammable liquid fire, vapor cloud explosion, storage vessel over-pressurization, equipment failure due to corrosion, release of hazardous materials due to over-filling and/or loss of containment.  The facility utilizes process controls such as vent collection systems, pressure and vacuum relief valves, in-line check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, automated interlocks, operating level alarms, operating procedures, grounding and bonding equipment, rupture disks, and excessive flow devices to prevent or limit releases.  Cardinal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and the Health & Safety Plan. The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and piping and instrument drawings (P&IDs).\n\n3.3.

In addition, Cardinal continues to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the types of material handled and company-specific emergency response procedures.\n\n2. Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Cardinal facility is a 170-million gallon per year dry-mill ethanol production plant.  The facility utilizes corn/milo to produce ethanol via natural fermentation to produce ethanol for blending with gasoline and other motor fuels while also maintaining the ability to produce and sell higher grades of alcohol for other industrial uses.  Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e. grain alcohol) through a batch fermentation and continuous distillation process.  Co-products produced as a result of ethanol manufacturing include Dried Distiller's Grains with Solubles (DDGS), corn oil and carbon dioxide.  Denaturant (Natural Gasoline), subject to RMP for its flammable properties, is used at the facility for blending with ethanol to comply with Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulations to allow final sale of  fuel grade product.  \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nAs required by EPA, Cardinal has established programs to address accidental release prevention measures and notification requirements of Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations.  In addition, Cardinal has established programs to address the process safety management (PSM) requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Cardinal is a dry mill ethanol production facility located in Union City, Randolph County, Indiana. This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. All included information was reviewed and approved by Cardinal management prior to submittal of this RMP.\n\nThe Cardinal facility is subject to the RMP rule due to storage above threshold quantities of natural gasoline, a regulated flammable mixture, also known as denaturant. This is an update to earlier RMP submittals.  \n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nCardinal is committed to operating the facility in a manner that promotes both the safety of our employees and the general public as well as being protective of the environment. Cardinal has adopted and implemented policies and procedures that ensure our operations adhere to applicable federal and state rules and regulations, as well as investing significant resources to prevent accidents.  The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent foreseeable accidental releases of regulated substances. Through the proper design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the equipment and training of our personnel, Cardinal has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  In the event that a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release and notify external emergency responders, as necessary.
