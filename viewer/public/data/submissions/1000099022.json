Industrial Source (Springfield, OR) location is subject to EPA RMP- Program \n\n3 requirements, as specified in 40 CFR 68.10, based on the EPA Worst case and Alternative case  on \n\nthe fire exposure endpoint for a worst-case scenario is within the vicinity of public receptors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial Source operates the Springfield OR. City facility on approximately 4.5 acres on the \n\nnorth side of town. The site is situated in an industrial area surrounded by commercial and \n\nindustrial operations.  The Industrial Source facility is bordered to the north by a lumber mill \n\nand on the eastern border an organic dirt processing facility.

The \n\ncylinders are pre-fill inspected, vented, evacuated, filled and tested in accordance with \n\nIndustrial Source Standard Operating Procedures.

The fill process is \n\ngenerally operated by one employee at a time.  This employee is  responsible for all phases of \n\nproduction on that shift. A second employee may be involved in the inspection and venting process, \n\nif production needs are great.\n\n\n\nThe process begins when cylinders returned from customers are visually inspected and odor checked \n\nfor contamination.  The residual product is vented into a dump tank until pressure equilibration is \n\nmet between the pressure in the venting tank and the pressure of the dump tank.  The dump tank is \n\nflared continuously, throughout the venting process, through a flare stack.   The flare stack is \n\noperated until there is no pressure remaining in the dump tank.\n\n\n\nFollowing the venting process, the cylinders are connected to an evacuation manifold and\n\nvacuum is drawn to 26\"Hg .  The cylinders are placed onto a certified electronic scale and\n\n\n\nindividually filled to 80% capacity using a Blackmer power pump. The process for venting, \n\nevacuating and filling cylinders does not include any chemical reactions.  However, the flaring \n\nprocess is combustion of residual hydrocarbons in returned cylinders.\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety precautions are in every step of the process, beginning with inventory level segregation. \n\nPassive mitigation, in the form of stock separation and fire barriers (bunkers) have been \n\ninstalled.  The fire barriers are concrete filled cinder block walls, RATED FOR 2 HOURS FIRE \n\nPROTECTION. Stock level signs have been posted and employees have been trained on the bunker \n\nstorage system.  These passive fire protection measures allow additional time for firefighting \n\nmeasures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant equipment was designed and installed to ensure the safest operation.

The first switch is a shut down \n\nswitch that  vents off the nitrogen  in the line. Once this switch is moved to the off position, \n\nthe nitrogen flow to the pneumatic actuators is turned off and simultaneously the pressure is bled \n\nfrom the lines. When this switch is in the off position no product can flow out of the storage \n\ntanks.\n\nThe second switch in this circuit is an Emergency Stop switch (E-stop), once the e-stop has been \n\nactuated the nitrogen  flow to the pneumatic actuators is turned off and simultaneously the \n\npressure is bled off from the lines.  In addition to shutting down the nitrogen supply and bleeding\n\noff the nitrogen line, the e-stop shuts down all electrical supply to the flammable fill island.\n\n"
