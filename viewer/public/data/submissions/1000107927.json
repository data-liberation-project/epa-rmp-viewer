      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\nThe Tropicale Foods, LLC, (Tropicale) Facility (Facility) in Lubbock, Texas produces and stores ice cream products. Anhydrous ammonia, an acutely hazardous material (AHM), is used in the Facility refrigeration system, which has an estimated inventory of approximately 29,046 pounds. This inventory exceeds the 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program (RMP) and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 10,000-pound threshold quantity. The Facility has developed a Risk Management Plan following federal EPA requirements. Tropicale acquired the Dynamic Foods facility in August 2022 and updated the facility and ammonia refrigeration system. Tropicale is committed to worker and public safety through investing in accident prevention programs, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system. Tropicale relies on support services provided by the local fire department in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \nThe Tropicale Facility is located at 1001 East 33rd Street, Lubbock, Texas, (APN R113676) and south of two rail transfer areas. The Facility is approximately 1.2 miles east of US Highway 27 and 0.9 miles south of State Highway 62. The Facility is located in an industrial area with residences approximately 260 yards to the south. The Facility has one anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system. The high stage compressors have a 28-psig suction pressure (+15\u00b0 F) and a normal discharge pressure of approximately 150-180 psig. Booster compressors operate at 14.3\u0094 Hg suction pressure (-50\u00b0 F) and a discharge pressure of approximately 28 psig. The refrigeration system is composed of the following key components:\n?\t2 \u0096 Condensers, BAC model VRC-1434A-2418N-NA\n?"

The TS vessel supplies liquid ammonia to the compressor oil coolers. High pressure liquid is fed by pressure differential to the high temperature recirculator (HTR) and the engine room air unit (AU1). The pressure in the CPR is maintained by the high temperature recirculated suction. Liquid ammonia is pumped from the HTR to high temperature units; MAU-1 and surge drum, ice cream freezers 1-6, and evaporators in the thaw rooms, blend room, 40-degree process room and dock.

The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condensers where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and condenses to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nBooster compressors draw \u0093dry\u0094 low temperature vapors (LTS) from the top of the low temperature recirculator (LTR) and discharge compressed vapor to the HTR where it provides pressure to the HTR vessel. Liquid makeup to the LTR is medium pressure liquid (MPL) from the HTR. LTR vessel level is controlled through level sensors and liquid solenoids. Low temperature recirculated liquid (LTRL) ammonia is pumped from the LTR to freezer units (-40\u00b0 F) surge drums (SD-1 & SD-2) and two brine and one glycol heat exchanger liquid/suction in the Stick Room (popsicles) and to ice cream freezers 1-6 (IC1-IC6). LTRS \u0093wet\u0094 (vapor/liquid) is drawn into the LTR by booster suction pressure. The LTR provides liquid/vapor phase separation of the incoming \u0093wet\u0094 suction. The LTRS is drawn from low temperature surge drums and heat exchangers 1 and 2, ice cream freezer low temperature evaporators 1-6, and -40\u00b0 F freezers. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL -SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nTropicale has implemented prevention program elements to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia for refrigeration. The RMP/PSM Prevention Program elements include the following:\n?\tProcess Safety Information\n?\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n?\tOperating Procedures\n?\tTraining Programs\n?\tMechanical Integrity\n?\tManagement of Change\n?\tPre-startup Safety Review\n?\tCompliance Audits\n?\tIncident Investigation\n?\tEmployee Participation\n?\tHot Work \n?\tContractor Safety\n?\tTrade Secrets (if applicable)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no releases that resulted in onsite or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nTropicale will not respond to uncontrolled release"

Tropicale has written and implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the Facility. The EAP describes initial actions to evacuate the Facility to designated assembly areas and wait for instructions from outside emergency response agencies. The EAP is periodically reviewed by Tropicale management and is coordinated annually with emergency response agencies.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nTropicale performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) in June 2023. The PHA team prepared a list of recommendations or action items to eliminate and/or mitigate the scenarios if the level of protection appeared insufficient. PHA recommendations are found in the 2023 Initial PHA Recommendation Resolution Tracking document. PHA team recommendations included:\n\u0095\tVerify that access to the recirculator vessel area is restricted to authorized personnel.\n\u0095\tImplement the established Mechanical Integrity program.\n\u0095\tVerify the machinery room doors are tight fitting, self-closing, open outward, have panic-style hardware, and are 1-hour fire rated. \n\u0095\tVerify the ammonia detection system alarms to a constantly monitored location when alarming, on loss of power, or on loss of signal.\n\u0095\tProvide access to the machinery room to qualified operators only.\n\nTropicale recognizes that the RMP/PSM Program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its Facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Tropicale continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Tropicale will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations.
