This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR):  The Facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one (1) additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  The Facility has well-established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

      "SummaryText": "Introduction and Policies\r\n\r\nThe Beckville Plant (Facility), owned and operated by Midcoast G&P (East Texas) L.P. (Midcoast), is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Midcoast assets promote.  This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them.  As a company, Midcoast follows a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all. \r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem-solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Regular internal audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe Facility, located in rural Panola County, Texas, operates a variety of processes to recover petroleum products (i.e., natural gas, natural gas liquids, condensate) from field gas. This plant consists of a cryogenic processing unit, an amine treating unit, a glycol dehydration unit, and residue electric compression.  Gas flows through an inlet separator where pipeline liquids are dropped out. The gas from the inlet separator is then treated to remove acid gas (CO2) and dehydrated before entering the cryogenic processing unit where a 16,000-gallon surge tank is utilized for processing.  Natural gas liquids (NGL) produced from the cryogenic processing unit are sent out of the Facility by pipeline.  The Facility also has multiple small storage tanks including methanol, lube oil, waste oil, produced water/slop oil, and their associated piping, valves, and pumps that support the plant operation"

The Facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about Midcoast's operations at the Facility, the programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, the emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, Midcoast's five (5) year accident history, and planned changes to improve safety at the Facility.\r\n \r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAs specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulations, the worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the liquid in the largest vessel at the Beckville Plant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of this Facility, this would involve the 16,000-gallon flammable NGL tank (53,329 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of one (1) pound per square inch (psi) would be approximately 0.3 mile (approximately 1,585 feet).  An overpressure of one (1) psi is the EPA's threshold for measurable impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario for flammable substance release, was also considered for this Facility.  The Alternate Release Scenario would result in a vapor cloud explosion from the loss of NGL from the 16,000-gallon NGL surge tank due to a four-inch puncture of the tank and a release of 47,350 pounds of NGL (as ethane) in 5 minutes.  Using the EPA's RMP*CompTM calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of one (1) psi would be approximately 0.2 mile (1,055 feet).  This incident could occur if vehicle traffic impacts the tank resulting in piping damage.  As a method of preventing such events, signs are posted"

Because the processes at the Facility are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation and are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:  Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program are important steps toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  The Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (Emergency Response Training, First Aid, etc.).  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing a"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:  The Facility maintains written procedures that"

      "SummaryText": "address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\r\n\r\nTraining:  To complement the written procedures for process operations, the Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in Facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors:  The Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures"

Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency action plan, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Facility management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  Another integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices:  The Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maint"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\n \r\nIncident Investigation:  The Facility promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until completed. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years, so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:  To help ensure that the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, the Facility periodically conducts audits to determine whether procedures and practices required by the Ac"
