      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nBadger State Ethanol, LLC\n\n\n\nBadger State Ethanol, LLC (BSE) is a fully operational ethanol production facility which began operations in October 2002.  BSE is designed to produce approximately 55,000,000 gallons of fuel-grade ethanol per year. Wet and dried distillers grains (WDGS/ DDGS) are byproducts of ethanol production and are sold to local markets as animal feed. Ethanol production activities fall under the SIC code 2869, Industrial Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nBSE is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by BSE's investment in accident prevention, through the establishment of a facility that is well designed, installed, operated and maintained. In addition, training is considered a crucial part of safe operation and accident presentation. Staff is trained about spill prevention and control methods as well as emergency response plans in place at the facility.\n\nIt is BSE policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary. BSE management is dedicated to safety, spill prevention and proper emergency response.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe BSE Ethanol Plant is located at 820 West 17th Street in southeast Monroe, Wisconsin. The site is located in the northeast corner of Section 4, Township 1 North, Range 7 East, Green County, Wisconsin. The site consists of approximately 28 acres and is bounded by Wisconsin & Southern Railroad Company to the south and by West 17th Street to the north.\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The substances which BSE has onsite that are regulated by the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which is considere"

      "SummaryText": "d a flammable mixture.  The anhydrous ammonia is used as a chemical processing aid and is consumed in the manufacturing process. It is stored in a single anhydrous ammonia tank. The denaturant (natural gasoline) is used to denature the ethanol so that it is unfit for human consumption before being shipped offsite. Denaturant is generally stored onsite in the denaturant and final product storage tanks.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nBSE has been subject to RMP criteria since it began storing anhydrous ammonia and denaturant (natural gasoline) onsite.\n\nIn the last five years, BSE has had no RMP reportable incidents.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\n\n\nBSE is included in the Community Emergency Response Plan and therefore does not have its own Emergency Response Plan for emergencies requiring a high level of emergency support. In the case that an incident occurred which required high level emergency response, BSE would call 911 for the necessary fire, medical or other emergency support. \n\nAs explained above, BSE is committed to worker and public safety and has invested in training and equipment to prevent chemical spills and other emergency situations. In the event of a chemical spill, plant personnel will respond to contain the release, as necessary. Some physical aspects of the plant would also help the personnel contain a potential spill. For example, all tanks that contain denaturant are located in a large, bermed containment area that is separated from the plant.  A release from one of these tanks would be prevented from migrating off-site, and a fire could be extinguished before it spreads to other units at the facility.  In addition, a manual shut off valve in the ammonia tank would help limit the volume of an ammonia spill. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nBSE is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3.  BSE is fulfilling its duties to comply with the EPA requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.115(d) through the completion of this RMP a"

      "SummaryText": "nd similar efforts regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  BSE has complied with Process safety information, safe work practices such as Hot Work, Confined Space Entry and Lockout/Tagout, and operations and maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analyses (PHA), training, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  \n\nThe denaturant tank is equipped with tank level sensors and alarms and has a bermed containment structure that surrounds the entire tank farm.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with a manual shut off valve.  However, BSE began to use urea as the base for the ethanol fermentation process in April of 2012.  BSE installed a blind to temporarily disable the ammonia flow into the fermentation tank until use is advantageous.  However, ammonia is still able to flow into the slurry tank.\n\n\n\nThese chemical specific prevention measures minimize the risk for an RMP reportable incident.  Compliance audits of the RMP Prevention Program will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations.   \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, BSE is committed to protecting its employees, the greater community and the environment from the release of hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process. BSE management is committed to promoting a safe work environment and will continue to provide its employees with the necessary training, tools, and ongoing support to operate the ethanol production facility in a safe and efficient manner. Periodic audits will help us assure that we are doing everything reasonable to minimize the risk and mitigate the effects of an accidental release.\n\n"
