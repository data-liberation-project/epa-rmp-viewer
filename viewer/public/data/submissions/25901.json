In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nGreenway's Corporate Mission states To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public. In order to fulfill this mission, Greenway provides a corporate safety director to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures.  Safety  supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company. \n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered. The safety director conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. The safety director requires a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\n \nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center as such we store and distribute a wide varie"

Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell anhydrous ammonia to grower customers in 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nThis facility maintains approximately forty (40)  1,000-gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery.  Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 188,000  pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in 3 stationary storage tank(s) [1 @ 18,000 gallon; 2 @ 11,000 gallon] on site.  188,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia is the maximum storage capacity of stationary storage tanks.  Therefore, the total facility anhydrous ammonia storage capacity for our facility is  376,000.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 84,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as a gas over 10 minutes, resulting total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Greenway has never had a release of an entire stationary storage tank.\n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site. The alternative release scenario modeled for the purposes of this plan is a 2-minute release from a stationary storage tank representing a valve and hose failure requiring a manual shut down.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact.  It should be"

This facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All of the main storage tank valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees involved with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nFive-year accident history.\n\n There has been no accidents involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.

This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA and coordinated with our LEPC.\n\nIn addition, Greenway has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.1200). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. \n\nWe will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
