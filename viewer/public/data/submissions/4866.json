      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIt is the policy of the City of College Station, Texas, to operate safe water and wastewater treatment facilities, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with our processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, our employees, and the environment. It is also our policy to work with the surrounding community and local emergency response agencies, and promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event that a process incident occurs at one of our plants.\nPrimary Activity\nThe primary activity at the Dowling Road Pump Station is municipal water disinfection and distribution.\nUse of Regulated Substance\nChlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant prior to distribution in the drinking water supply.\nQuantity Handled or Stored\nChlorine: 18,000 pounds\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nFailure of a ton container of 2,000 pounds of chlorine; 10 minute release mitigated by a factor of 0.55 because the process is sheltered by a building.  Under worst case weather, chlorine could travel 1.55 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\nFailure of a vacuum regulator check unit in the open position.  The release would be mitigated by an enclosure, resulting in a release rate of 5.8 pounds per minute, and an offsite distance of 0.26 miles.  This is about the most realistic release that would ever be expected to occur.  \nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Dowling Road Pump Station is in compliance with the RMP Rule, 40 CFR 68. The facility has conducted a comprehensive review of all systems, as well as administrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures, in addition to the other required program elements of the Rule. As a result of a Hazard Review at this pump station, recommendations were developed to install or upgrade some safety items. \nFi"

Some of the recommendations are currently being implemented. Others are being prioritized and budgeted accordingly.\n' We will ensure employees have updated operating procedures and that they are trained.\n' We have updated our emergency response procedures and will revise them as appropriate.\n' We are evaluating implementation of a formal chlorine vendor audit program.  We will verify good containers and will prefer drivers who are B-Kit trained and qualified. \n' We are currently considering emergency scrubber installation for both the Dowling Road and Sandy Point Road facilities.  We will evaluate construction and O&M costs, and are also evaluating alternatives to chlorine disinfection.\n' We will ensure ton container caps are in place before handling containers.\n' We will ensure lines are evacuated prior to removing vacuum regulating check units.\n' We are coordinating with the Police Department for more frequent patrols past the facility as required.  \n' We will evaluate installation of redundant leak detectors."
