      "SummaryText": "Source and Process Description.\n\nThe main operation at New Orleans Cold Storage is the warehousing and distribution of frozen bulk foodstuff.  The facility consists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.  An additional \"blast\" unit is used to maintain one room at very low temperatures (-30 degrees F.)\n\nBoth refrigeration units utilize Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system coolant.  The main refrigeration unit has a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia.  The blast unit has a maximum capacity of 5,000 pounds.  At this facility, both systems are independent.\n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental areas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin, respiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a caustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is defined as the concentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  However, aggravation of existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below the toxic endpoint.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic release would have ample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would provide a significant degree of isolation in the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to any leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the engine room.  If ammonia is detected, an audible alarm is immediately sounded within the warehouse and an alert is sent to a 24 hour"

This includes a daily inspection of compressors, pumps and associated equipment, and a weekly, monthly and annual inspection and maintenance schedule that is rigidly followed, ensuring a well-maintained physical plant.\n\nAll operating procedures have been recently reviewed/revised and all personnel responsible for the proper operation of the refrigeration units have received refresher training in the procedures.  These elements of this program will further reduce the possibility of an accidental release caused by human error.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards.\n\nThe primary methods for generating recommendations are through periodic review and/or revision of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), incident investigations and operational procedures review (Management of Change). These reviews provide a means for continuous improvement.\n\nAs an example, in response to a recommendation from an incident investigation report from another facility, two sets of impervious body suits and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are positioned at all NOCS facilities.  All engineers are trained in the use of this equipment as an enhanced way of personnel rescue, release response and rapid control.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release.\n\nUpon initial discovery of a leak or release, whether by sensor and alarm or personnel, a rapid and decisive response is critical to minimizing the potential impacts to off-site populations and other sensitive areas.  As noted above, on-site control and mitigation, along with personnel evacuation and accountability, is coupled with a rapid notification plan to bring in local and sta"
