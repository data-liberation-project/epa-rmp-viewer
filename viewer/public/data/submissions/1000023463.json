In addition to other federal, state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We continue this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety.\r\n\r\nThe Millard Refrigerated Services, Inc. facility is located at 1985 Airpark Drive, Springfield, Ohio.  We distribute some of the finest pork products in the world.  The facility includes piping, finished goods refrigerated storage and distribution, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room and miscellaneous utilities. \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan.  The refrigeration system contains approximately 18,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\r\n\r\nMillard Refrigerated Services, Inc. has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property as well as environmental damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. \r\n\r\nMillard Refrigerated Services, Inc. has organized the information following the Process Safety Management Guidelines. The polices"

The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in the hazards associated with their work, and made aware of the hazards presented by the facility to the employees of the contractor.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review Programs: These programs have been developed to monitor and provide a checks and balances system to monitor changes in the facility and to verify that changes are safe and consistent with company policy.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Program: To prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of ammonia, it is important to ensur"

The purpose of an MI program is to maintain process equipment so that a catastrophic release of ammonia is avoided or properly contained. The emphasis should be on preventive maintenance rather than breakdown maintenance.\r\n\r\nMany more specific programs and policies (Hot Work, Confined Space, Lockout / Tagout, Employee training, etc..) have been developed. For information specific to these see the Risk and Reliability Manager.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis Re-validation was completed in September 2010..  The PHA highlighted some deficiencies in the system. These items were addressed as part of the continuous improvement of the facility.

The supervisor takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device.  If the supervisor determines that the ammonia level is above 25 ppm an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered.\r\n\r\nThe Supervisor determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed.
