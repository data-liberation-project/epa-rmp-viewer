This RMP/CalARP, submitted by Applied Energy LLC (AE LLC), presents the 5-year anniversary update and resubmittal; there have been no process changes (per 40 CFR Part 68.190) since June 21, 1999.\n\nAs background for this facility, AE LLC is the current owner. Applied Energy, Inc. (AEI) was owner/operator of the facility that prepared a Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) for handling anhydrous ammonia (NH3) at this facility in October 1996, and submitted the RMPP to the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health\u00bfs Hazardous Materials Division (HMD) under the former California RMPP rule.  HMD approved the RMPP for this facility on January 14, 1997.  HMD granted approval for AE LLC to revise and update the existing RMPP and submit it as a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and HMD under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP); AEI\u00bfs RMP/CalARP document was submitted June 21, 1999. For purposes of this update and resubmittal, the previous references to AEI are replaced by AE LLC in this document.\n\nAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename \u00bfNRS_EXEC\u00bf as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of AE LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located at North Island (NORIS) in the City of Coronado and County of San Diego, California.  \n\n1.1\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy\n\nIt is the policy of A"

It is the firm policy of AE LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\n\n1.2\tDescription of Regulated Process\n\nThe cogeneration facility is located within U.S. Navy property.  The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  NORIS also uses anhydrous NH3 in a refrigeration system for cooling the gas turbine inlet air.  Ammonia vapor from the accumulator tank is compressed and cooled to form liquid NH3.  The liquid NH3 is sent through the cooling coils where it cools the gas turbine inlet air before returning to the accumulator tank.  The chiller system was installed at NORIS in 1992.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontally mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,500 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 4,000 gallons (24,320 lbs.).  There is also a closed chiller system with 2,330 gallons (14,666 lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia.  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 51,332 gallons. \n\n1.3\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to provide steam to the Navy and electricity to SDG&E, AE LLC\u00bfs cogeneration facility is vital to national s"

The major safety systems in place at the facility include process safety equipment and administrative safety procedures.  The Year 2000 (Y2K) plan was implemented.\n\nProcess safety equipment means that the facility is designed and built according to accepted safety codes and standards for electrical, mechanical, and structural integrity.  AE LLC\u00bfs process safety equipment includes a number of redundant systems, made up of local and remote indicators, sensors, and alarms that monitor operating levels, pressures and temperatures, and relay information to the facility Control Room Operator through an automated Distribution Control System. \n\nThe ammonia handling process includes relief, isolation, and vent valves that can provide a margin of safety in the event of deviations from normal conditions, by allowing the operator to identify and isolate the problem and either return the system to normal conditions, or safely shut down the process.  The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\n\nA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \n\nAn operator training program"

Installation of these valves in December 2002, and updates of operating procedures were completed in June 2003. Other than the addition of these valves (and related process/SOP updates) and replacement of equipment, the facility has not undergone any significant changes in its process, SOPs, maintenance system, training program, or equipment.\n\nRecommendations made as part of the review for the 1999 federal RMP and CalARP, and the subsequent triennial audit conducted in 2002 were implemented, unless otherwise indicated. Recommendations from the 2004 RMP update will be implemented by January 1, 2005, unless otherwise indicated.  These are: \n\n1)\tChange facility P&ID to reflect replacement of the old chiller condenser (1,560 ton) with a Baltimore Air Coil 1,810 ton system. \n\n2)\t Update the Site map to reflect removal of Cabrillo Power\u00bfs gas turbines, and associated equipment and structures, as well as addition of adjacent 227,000-gallon fuel storage tank to the facility\u00bfs operations.\n\n3)"

HMD approved the RMPP for this facility on January 14, 1997.  HMD granted approval for AE LLC to revise and update the existing RMPP and submit it as a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to U.S. EPA and HMD under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP); AEI's RMP/CalARP document was submitted June 21, 1999. For purposes of this update and resubmittal, the previous references to AEI are replaced by AE LLC in this document.\r\rAs required by the federal EPA, this executive summary has been submitted to the EPA under the filename NRS_EXEC as a text document.  This RMP Public Document presents the efforts of AE LLC to manage and prevent risks associated with the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia at its cogeneration facility located at North Island (NORIS) in the City of Coronado and County of San Diego, California.  \r\r1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policy\r\rIt is the policy of AE LLC to protect the health and safety of its employees, officers, and the general public.  It is the firm policy of AE LLC to fully and faithfully comply with all requirements, both substantive and reporting, of all environmental, health, and safety statues, regulations, ordinances, and permits affecting the operations and maintenance of our plants.  AE LLC has in place a number of plans for responding to emergency situations.  These plans are described in this RMP Public Document.\r\r1.2 Description of Regulated Process\r\rThe cogeneration facility is located within U.S. Navy property.

The ammonia storage tank has a deluge system, which, in the event of a major leak or release, will activate high pressure water nozzles around the tank to quench the ammonia that is released.\r\rA number of administrative safety procedures complement the process safety equipment at the AE LLC facility.  These include written standard operating procedures (SOP) for all processes; twice-daily shift walkdown inspections of all major equipment, valves and alarms; extensive use of procedures checklists, such as for ammonia tank loading; and an automated preventative maintenance system for tracking daily repair work orders and scheduled maintenance operations. \r\rAn operator training program encompassing operating procedures, safety and health, and emergency response with a biennial re-qualification requirement, helps ensure that employees think, act, and work safely while on the job.\r\rIn addition to the OSHA PSM, the AE LLC facility holds federal and state emergency response and safety plans, including the Hazardous Substance Contigency Plan (HSCP), Emergency Action Plan (EAP), Fire Prevention Plan (FPP), Exposure Control Plan (ECP), Injury and Illness Prevention Plan (IIPP), Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP), and Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP).\r\r1.4 Five-Year Accident History\r\rThere have been no accidental releases, no reactive incidents (e.g., fire, explosions, etc.), and no near misses of ammonia at the AE LLC facility w"

      "SummaryText": "ithin the last five years.\r\r1.5 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\rSince the 1999 RMP effort, as part of the process safety features, solenoid-actuated valves were installed.  Installation of these valves in December 2002, and updates of operating procedures were completed in June 2003. Other than the addition of these valves (and related process/SOP updates)  and replacement of equipment, the facility has not undergone any significant changes in its process, SOPs, maintenance system, training program, or equipment.\r\rRecommendations made as part of the review for the 1999 federal RMP and CalARP, and the subsequent triennial audit conducted in 2002 were implemented, unless otherwise indicated. Recommendations from the 2004 RMP update will be implemented by January 1, 2005, unless otherwise indicated.  These are: \r\r1) Change facility P&ID to reflect replacement of the old chiller condenser (1,560 ton) with a Baltimore Air Coil 1,810 ton system. \r\r2)  Update the Site map to reflect removal of Cabrillo Power's gas turbines, and associated equipment and structures, as well as addition of adjacent 227,000-gallon fuel storage tank to the facility's operations.\r\r3) Make a list of operating procedures with review/revision date and reviewer's name, and place inside SOP (a.k.a.
