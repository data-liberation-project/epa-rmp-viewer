The Newark Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Newark, NJ. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, pentane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of pentane. Pentane is received by truck and stored in one (1) 60,000-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, pentane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The pentane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250oF) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm) on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Newark Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.\n\n\n\nThe Newark Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Newark Terminal. The covered process at the Terminal is regulat"

      "SummaryText": "ed by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as NJDEP Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act program N.J.A.C. 7:31 (1-6) and the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the facility. The Newark Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA 30 [2012]) requirements for flammable liquid storage. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of pentane, if a release does occur, an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Newark City Fire Department and Newark City Emergency Planning.\n\n\n\nNo accidents/incidents have occurred on the covered process in the last five-years. We are continually striving to make Newark Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for our employees, our neighbors and our community. The facility's focus is safe, reliable and environmentally sound operations. The goal of the Newark Terminal is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance. In addition, we will work cooperatively with our neighbors to ensure the health, environment, safety and security of Newark Terminal and surrounding community."
