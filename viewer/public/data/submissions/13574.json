      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeably, if a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of a release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department; Hazardous Materials Response Unit serving the City of Industry Area, which provides additional emergency response expertise.  \n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass production of fluid milk products, condensed milk products, cultured milk products, cottage cheese, butter, ice cream, non-carbonated fruit drinks, and ice.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility; ammonia (anhydrous) used as a refrigerant.  The maximum inventory ammonia (anhydrous) is 44,000 pounds and is contained within a single large refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Alta Dena Certified Dairy, City of Industry Plant.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic"

In this scenario 5068.34 pounds of ammonia  are released from the controlled pressure receiver, the largest vessel in the system.  The toxic liquid released inside an enclosed building and is assumed to form a one cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10-minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as the building enclosure is taken into account to calculate the scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia  involves an hypothetical release from ammonia piping on the roof above the refrigeration equipment room.  The scenario involves the release of 46.22 pounds of ammonia from a pipe flange or pipe fitting.  The release is assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown systems, monitoring and manual shutdown.  The release is estimated to occur over a 15-minute period prior to the implementation of control measures by system operational and emergency response personnel. \n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Uniform Building Code.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology known as a Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) was used to carry out the"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/27/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Alta-Dena Certified Dairy, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.
