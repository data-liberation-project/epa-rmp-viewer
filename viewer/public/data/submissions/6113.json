      "SummaryText": "The City of Graham Water Treatment Plant is located on the Power Plant Road just below our\ntwo lakes, Lake Graham and Lake Eddleman.  The two lakes are connected together by a \nchannel.\n\nWe pump water from Lake Eddleman to our Treatment Plant, the raw water enters the plant at \nthe Rapid Mix Chamber where we add chlorine, aluminum sulfate, and fluoride.\n\nThe water is mixed with these chemicals, then it goes into the Folckulater area where the water \nand the chemicals are being mixed to form a flock to settle out the suspended solids, from here \nthe water continues on to the settling basin where the suspended solids settle out, from there \nto the filters which remove any solids that didn't settle out in the settling basin.  After the water \nleaves the filters, we add chlorine to meet the requirements of TNRCC and at this time we add \ncaustic to adjust the pH, the water continues on to the clear well to be pumped to the City \nStorage Tanks and main lines.\n\nOur Water Plant is designed to treat up to six million (6,000,000) gallons of water per day (24 \nhours).\n\nAt the present time we have four one ton cylinders of chlorine at the Water Plant.\n\nACCIDENTAL PREVENTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY\n\nWe have a list of safety rules that we follow when we handle chlorine.  If we have a small leak \non the chlorine, our plant personnel will repair it, if we have a bad chlorine leak we call the Fire \nDepartment.\n\nWe have the self contained breathing apparatus that the personnel wear while repairing \nchlorine leaks.\n\nWe inspect and maintain our equipment to reduce the risk of equipment breakdown and reduce \nthe risk of accidents and chemical leaks.\n\nThe worse-case release scenario would be if one of the 1 ton chlorine cylinders ruptured.  The \nalternative release scenario would be if we had a leak on the line or the regulator on the \nchlorine cylinder.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program Safety Rules\n\n1.    Only trained personnel should work with chlorine.\n2.    Never "

An acceptable escape mask should be in the immediate area \nand an approved supply of breathing air with full facial mask should be on the site \nand/or close at hand.

We \nhaven't had a spill of any kind in the last five years.\n\nThe emergency response program - If we have a minor chlorine leak, the Plant Operator on \nduty will contact his supervisor to help him with the repair.  If we have a major chlorine leak, \nthe Plant Operator will immediately call the Fire Department and his supervisor.  When the first \nFire Department Official arrives on the scene, he will immediately notify his dispatcher and \nprovide the following information:\n\n    1.    Location of the chemical spill.\n    2.    The type of hazardous chemical spill.\n    3.    Extent of immediate personal injuries.\n    4.
