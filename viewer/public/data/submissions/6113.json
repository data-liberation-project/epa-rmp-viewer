The two lakes are connected together by a \nchannel.\n\nWe pump water from Lake Eddleman to our Treatment Plant, the raw water enters the plant at \nthe Rapid Mix Chamber where we add chlorine, aluminum sulfate, and fluoride.\n\nThe water is mixed with these chemicals, then it goes into the Folckulater area where the water \nand the chemicals are being mixed to form a flock to settle out the suspended solids, from here \nthe water continues on to the settling basin where the suspended solids settle out, from there \nto the filters which remove any solids that didn't settle out in the settling basin.  After the water \nleaves the filters, we add chlorine to meet the requirements of TNRCC and at this time we add \ncaustic to adjust the pH, the water continues on to the clear well to be pumped to the City \nStorage Tanks and main lines.\n\nOur Water Plant is designed to treat up to six million (6,000,000) gallons of water per day (24 \nhours).\n\nAt the present time we have four one ton cylinders of chlorine at the Water Plant.\n\nACCIDENTAL PREVENTION EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY\n\nWe have a list of safety rules that we follow when we handle chlorine.  If we have a small leak \non the chlorine, our plant personnel will repair it, if we have a bad chlorine leak we call the Fire \nDepartment.\n\nWe have the self contained breathing apparatus that the personnel wear while repairing \nchlorine leaks.\n\nWe inspect and maintain our equipment to reduce the risk of equipment breakdown and reduce \nthe risk of accidents and chemical leaks.\n\nThe worse-case release scenario would be if one of the 1 ton chlorine cylinders ruptured.  The \nalternative release scenario would be if we had a leak on the line or the regulator on the \nchlorine cylinder.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program Safety Rules\n\n1.
