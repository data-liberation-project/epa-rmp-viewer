The Hazardous Communication Program has been incorporated into the Risk Management Program to help evaluate the needs of our facility. Informational training sessions with employees on response to an emergency has prepared them to respond in a safe manner. Our facility is a wastewater treatment plant and the wastewater is chlorinated for disenfection purposes. One ton cylinders are used for this process and there are normally 3 to 4 cylinders stored on-site. Two cylinders are on-line and the others are stored inside the building waiting for use. The worst case scenario for this facility would be the release4 of a one ton cylinder. There has never been a release of chlorine that could not be routinely handled. The employees at the treatment plant have been trained to respond to leaks and are knowlegeble of the emergency agencies to notify if a leak cannot be contained immeadiately. Environmental Management Corporation and the City of St. Charles will continue to monitor the chlorine process and take any measures to prevent an accidental release. The safety of our employees and our community is the number one priority."
