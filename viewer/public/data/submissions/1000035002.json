The Greater Houston LEPC and the Houston Fire Department have been provided copies of this plan. If a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count.  If the operator of the system in question is unable to mitigate the release using manual valves, the emergency shutdown system will be utilized to shut down all the pumps and components of the systems to prevent any further operation.

This release, if the vessel were full, would have a release of 40,000 pounds of methyl chloride. Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves, and manual shutoffs. Passive mitigation was not considered for this release scenario. The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 1.3 miles. The area surrounding the facility is considered urban (Industrial). This release scenario could impact approximately 10,131 persons in a 5.3 square mile radius. This information was determined using RMP*Comp and MARPLOT 10 Software.\n\n\n\nThe flammable worst case scenarios for a flammable release would be the failure of the bulk vessel storing ethylene or methane.  These releases, if the vessel were full, would result in a release of 38,475 pounds or 38,500 pounds respectively.  Active mitigation was considered for this release, including excess flow valves and manual shutoffs.  No passive mitigation was considered.
