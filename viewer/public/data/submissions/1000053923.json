The owners, management and employees of Backes and Toelke dba Marthasville Ag are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Warren County LEPC, and other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the residents and the environment of our community.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information. The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Accident Release Prevention Program. This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OHSA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Hadling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and our State regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.   \r\n\r\n4.  Five-Year Accident History. We had an accidental release this year.  Fortunately, no injuries occurred because of this accident.  We have never had  any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths or injuries.  The agricultural NH3 nurse tank wagon became unhooked because the pin sheered.  We have never had this happen before.  Our driver notified all the necessary agencies at the time of the release.   We created a dirt dam barrier to protect all ground water sources.  The fire department assisted us in keeping the gas fumes down so no one would get hurt.  We collected all the water and spread it on the farmer field.  We were assisted by the highway department in protection the people on the highway and rerouting the traffic so no one had to sit and wait for the area to be cleared. I think it was an unfortunate thing that happened.  The pin  that broke in half was the standard pin that came with the wagon from the manufacturer.  All the agencies that were involved w"

Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release and call 911 and all the applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations continue to be  performed to access the conditions of the faciltiy."
