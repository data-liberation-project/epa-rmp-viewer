Iowa Premium is committed to operating its ammonia refrigeration system in a safe and environmentally sound manner and relies upon its Risk Management Program to help identify ways to reduce potential risks to its employees, the community, and the environment.  Iowa Premium will maintain a safe workplace by complying with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; promptly correcting any unsafe conditions; and training its employees to safely perform their job duties.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nIowa Premium has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from its plant at 3327 L Avenue near Tama, Iowa.  At this location Black Angus cattle are processed into fresh and frozen meat products for distribution to domestic and international customers for further processing.  The industrial process relies upon the use of meat coolers and refrigerated rooms to keep the food products cold during preparation, packaging and storage.  The refrigeration system stores and uses anhydrous ammonia in a quantity that exceeds EPA's regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps \n\nIowa Premium's designers, contractors, and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the manufacture and construction of the equipment and system components at the Tama facility.  Standard operating procedures that dictate the safe work practices and a maintenance program specifying proper inspection, testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures are used at this facility.  Also, hazard communication regarding the ammonia refrigeration system regularly occurs between management, operators, and employees during initial employee orientation, the process hazard analysis, process safety informa"

      "SummaryText": "tion reviews, training, safety briefings, and periodic program reviews.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the past 5 years, Iowa Premium has had no accidental release of ammonia resulting in death, injury, or significant property damage, or offsite death, injury, evacuation, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at Iowa Premium and coordinated with the local emergency responders at the Tama Fire Department and LEPC.  The emergency action plan recognizes the LEPC as the emergency coordinators and the Tama Fire Department as the first responders.  This plan defines the actions to be taken due to a fire, flood, chemical spill or tornado and provides guidance for the notification, response, evacuation and shelter in place of Iowa Premium's employees.  \n\n\n\nSafety Improvements \n\nIowa Premium strives for continual safety improvement and regularly participates in safety related activities which contribute to the safety of the facility.  As part of the 2014 plant renovation new ammonia engine rooms and associated equipment including evaporators and piping were purchased and installed.  Iowa Premium also regularly participates in training and internal facility safety reviews; hosts the local Fire Department during facility tours, receives annual insurance carrier facility safety inspections, conducts regular integrity testing, and offers employees awareness level and refresher training on the ammonia refrigeration system.  Iowa Premium will be providing specialized training for its ammonia refrigeration operators, is scheduling on-site HazWoper training, and has obtained the safety information published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration to guide its procedures.  All of these efforts are intended to provide potential improvements to safety.  This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all Iowa Premium employees \n\n\n\n"
