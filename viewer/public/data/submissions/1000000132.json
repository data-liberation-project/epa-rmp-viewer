      "SummaryText": "Mennel Milling operates a large mill in Fostoria, Ohio that processes wheat into many different grades of\nflour. Several of the grades involve a process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve a \ndesired pH. In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to inhibit\nmicrobial growth.\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling and used in one ton containers.  The supplier delivers full chlorine\ncontainers to the site via truck.  The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the \nuse of an overhead crane rail hoist.  Mennel Milling staff connects the ton containers to the feed system.\nThe maximum number of ton containers is twelve (12) for a maximum on-site chlorine inventory of 24,000\npounds.\nMennel Milling uses vacuum feed systems for the application of chlorine to the flour and wheat that are \ninherently safe. These systems involve the use of air or water flowing through an eductor that creates a vacuum.\nThis vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line \ndownstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum\nregulator automatically closes,preventing the discharge of chlorine gas.\nMennel Milling has contracted with Research Products Co. (REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive\nand corrective maintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\nMennel Milling has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA\nPSM program.  The elements of this program include:\n+Process Safety Information\n+Process Hazard Analysis\n+Operating Procedures\n+Training\n+Management of Change\n+Prestartup Safety Review\n+Compliance Audits\n+Incident Investigation\n+Contractor Management\n+Hot Work Permits\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of chlorine at Mennel Milling that have resulted\nin deaths, injuries, or significant damage on site, or known offs"

      "SummaryText": "ite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed for the site.  This plan contains measures that Mennel Milling\nstaff can take to alert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a \nsignificant release, and many other elements. Mennel Milling staff will receive training to allow for defensive\naction in response to an onsite release. In the event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling will contact the \nFostoria Fire Dept. for technical support.  The fire dept. is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine \nincidents.\nThe facility has coordinated its emergency response activities with the City of Fostoria and the Hancock\nCounty LEPC.\nMennel Milling has performed hazard evaluations for the chlorination processes at the facility.  As a result of\nthis evaluation, several changes have been completed to improve safety, including:\n1. Cones with warning signs during loading and unloading\n2. Established procedures for loading and unloading (written and posted)\n3. When A-Mill agitators are bypassed by pass valve is closed (in S.O.P. for operations).\n4. Posted procedures at chlorine room for proper handling and safety.\n5. Posted and maintained a log sheet in chlorine room for any maintenance performed on system.\n6. Improved labelling of chlorine pipes."
