All Contractor work is performed using work permit system which contains a description of the work and risk assessment of the work to be completed on each permit. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions or training.\n\nInternal corporate environmental, health, and safety audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  Environmental, health and safety professionals periodically review the environmental, health and safety programs.  By addressing recommendations from these audits and reviews keeps the Facility Safety and Environmental programs effective.\n\n4. Five-year accident history.\n\nIn the five year period from July 19, 2018 to July 18, 2023 there were no reportable off-site releases of regulated substances.\n\n5. Emergency response program\n\nThe plant emergency response plan describes procedures for types of releases including coordination with responders.  An emergency response drill is conducted as required by the regulation to test the emergency response plan and reinforce training that plant responders receive.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nNo significant changes are planned."

All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nDesignated personnel maintain the Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool for reference.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures or processes or product formulations go through a safety review.  This review may include a process hazard analysis.  \n\nPreventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  An electronic database is used to manage the preventative maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility\u2019s equipment.

The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAs stated in the Corporate Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, our company is committed to environmental, health and safety excellence.  Environmental, health and safety planning is integrated into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety and environmental issues.\n\nThe company Safety Manual defines requirements and guidelines to prevent injuries and accidental releases.  The Safety Manual also includes Emergency response procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant primarily makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes one (1) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, one (1) Urea-Formaldehyde/Phenol - Formaldehyde Resin Reactor, one (1) Urea-Formaldehyde/ Formaldehyde Resin Reactor.  Although the site distributes formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for various types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.  \n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde                    1,400,000 lbs.\nAmmonia                               28,000 lbs.                                                                                                       \n\n3.Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and applicable state codes and regulations.
