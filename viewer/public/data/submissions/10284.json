Lake, Mn. 56159\n\nFor further information contact Gary Mohr, General Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan-Executive Summary\n\n1.  THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Cooperative Oil Assn of Mt. Lake are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers and storage of propane for the sale to farmers.\n\n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application for crop production nutrients. Propane is also received and stored for direct delivery to farmers.\n\n     - The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 515,000 pounds in our 3-18,000 gallon storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 110,000 pounds in 1-30,000 gallon tank and 1-26,000 gallon tank.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n     a.The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 6 minutes for anhydrous ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the  largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint of dispersion to 200ppm is.94 miles.\n\nFor propane, the worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1psi over pressure to a distance of .43 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n     b.The alternative release scenario for ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3"

      "SummaryText": "\" pipe break resulting in a distance of .78 miles.\n\nFor propane, the alternative release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1psi over pressure to a distance of(factor.67 x .43 miles = .29 miles) .29 miles. The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration-OSHA-, 29CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia Rules. For propane, NFPA-58 Rules.\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    There have been no accidental releases od anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     -The facility has:\n     a.A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA standard,29CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b.Provided State and Local Authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title lll-EPCRA.\n\n     c.Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe contitions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia or propane safety \nrecommendations for implementation at this time."
