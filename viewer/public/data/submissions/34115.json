The CIT-CON Oil Corporation has had very few excursions of toxic or flammable releases of regulated substances.  The facility investigates incidents carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n    From June 21, 1999 to June 21, 2004, CIT-CON Oil Corporation has on record 1 accident involving RMP covered processes and meeting the criteria set forth in the EPA regulation. That incident resulted in a fire and damage to equipment in excess of $775,000.  \n\n5.0    General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\n\n    The following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the CIT-CON Oil Corporation.  Because processes at the facility are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n    The CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lake Charles Manufacturing Complex's Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.

These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and facility management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n    The CIT-CON Oil Company keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameter, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis / configuration information.  Appropriate departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining portions of process safety information.\n\n    Chemical specific information including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment consideration, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  \n\nFor specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems). \n\n    The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n    The CIT-CON Oil Corporation primarily uses the Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  Hazop analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering  expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n    The PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to a PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident  scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted on 5 year intervals and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer o"

These procedures can be used as reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process\n\nIn addition, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation maintains  key process parameter documents which provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\n\nTraining\n\n    To complement the written procedures for process operations, CIT-CON Oil Corporation has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in the facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe and responsible manner on their own, they can work independently.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incidents or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n    To help ensure that the PSM/Accident Prevention Program part or rule is functioning  properly, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation in conjunction with the Corporate Safety Group periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedure and practices required by the applicable PSM / Accident Prevention part or rule are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team can consist of a broad base of management and /or hourly personnel from the facility or from other operating units of CIT-CON Oil Corporation and/or contract third parties.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n6.0     Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n    The processes at the CIT-CON Oil Corporation have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failure and (2) human error.\n\n    In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation has safety features on many of its units to help (1) contain / control a release, (2) quickly detect a release and  (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes.\n\nRelease Detection\n\n? Hydrocarbon Sensors\n? Heat Detection heads and sensors\n\n\nRelease Containment / Control\n\n? Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases \n? Valves to permit the isolation of the processes (manual and automatic)\n? Automated shutdowns for specific process parameters (e.g. high temperature, high level etc..)\n? Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n? Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g. uninterruptible power supply for process controllers, backup firewater systems.\n? Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n? Fire Suppression and Extinguishing Systems\n? Deluge system for specific equipment\n? Trained emergency response Personnel\n? Personal Protective Equipment\n    \n\n 8.0    Emergency Response Program Information\n\n    The CIT-CON Oil Corporation maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect public safety, worker safety and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
