      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The stationary source is the ammonia refrigeration system owned and operated by Boar\u00c2\u00bfs Head Provisions Company, 2230 Wyatt\u00c2\u00bfs Mill Road, Jarratt, VA. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. \nThis is an existing food processing facility.  The two refrigeration systems in this facility have an inventory approximately 52,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The processes do not meet the requirements of Program 1. They are subject to OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThis facility follows a rigorous fourteen volume Process Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. This RMP also addresses the PSM program in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the both process safety programs to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. \n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW \nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle. It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. The only substance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. \n\nThe process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid and then repeats the process. The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature and cools the gas until it condenses. The condensed liquid is pumped to a low pres"

It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.  As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, warning signs, and evacuation procedures. All employees have access to the PSM Program. Involved employees participate directly in every phrase of the PSM program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing incident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.\nCommunity involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipme"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator. Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\n\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids. \n\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are requir"

This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly usin"
