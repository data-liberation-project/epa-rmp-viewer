These services include the storage and transport of hazardous chemicals.  We are proud of our safety record and strive to ensure that we design and operate our facility so that hazards are minimized and risks controlled..\n\nWe have one process and one hazardous substance onsite in a quantity that exceeds the threshold quantity designated by EPA under 40CFRpart 68.  That substance (ethylene diamine) is used in our packaged  chemical storage process, which involves the storage of chemicals in 55 gallon drums.  No other processing of this substance occurs at our facility.\n\nUsing EPA-approved methods and technology, we have analyzed worst-case and alternative scenarios for the unlikely release of ethylene diamine, from our facility .  The results of these analyses, including any public or environmental receptors are available from the US EPA upon request.  Based on criteria defined by EPA, we have determined that a Risk Management Program Level 1 applies to the stated process.\n\nWe have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this process to help ensure that a harmful release of chemicals stored and handled at our facility does not occur.  These programs and practices include:\n-    Use of recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our equipment and ensuring the equipment meets applicable codes and standards.\n-    Continual assessment of hazards and safeguards in our process, in order to reduce risks, by our personnel, our suppliers and recognized chemical experts.\n-    Maintaining preparedness and contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n-    Coordination of our Emergency Contingency Plan with local Fire Department and Emergency Response agencies\n\nQuaker City Chemicals is continu"
