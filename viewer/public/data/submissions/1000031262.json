This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Cayey Filtration Plant is already observing many engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nCayey Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers. The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to two (2) different injections points along the process of the plant. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2000 lbs) during 10 minutes"

Standard Operational Procedures SOP's are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP\u00bfs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\nFive years Accident History:\r\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) lbs has been reported during the last five years. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nPRASA has already implemented in Cayey Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage.  \r\n\r\nAudits:\r\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on Jan. 25 2012. But during the past two years we have conducted internal metrics evaluation. With each metric evaluation we request an action plan to correct findings. PRASA has develop these evaluations to establish level of compliance of our facilities with the RMP/PSM Program regulations requierements."
