              "Description": "Butane Blending System provides for the blending of liquefied butane under pressure from three (3) stationary pressure vessels [maximum 90,000 gallons of water capacity] with a liquefied butane maximum fill level of 85% (76,500 gallons). The liquefied butane is offloaded from tractor trailers [2x off-load stations located at Orlando Terminal], stored in the above pressurized vessels, and transferred to/blended with gasoline (regular and premium lines) prior to the truck loading rack (three [3] loading racks [a Six {6} bay rack {5 lanes with be in gas service}, a three {3} bay loading rack {all lanes gas service} and a three {3} bay loading rack {2 bays gas one PCW}]) through the use of a fixed piping system, butane blending skids (x2), gasoline fast loop skids (x3), ethanol fast loop skids (x2), and ethanol blending skid. The injection rate of approximately 0.25 -8% is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based on analytical data received by on-site auto samplers (Bartec-Benke Units [x2]). Residual sample is then returned to the regular gasoline line via 225 gallon sample recovery tanks (SRTs [x2]) and associated skid. The system is designed to minimally meet the requirements of NFPA #58 (2014).",

It is the intent of the Orlando Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA # 58-2014 Edition) into this process. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Orange County Fire and Rescue as well as the Orange County Department of Emergency and Safety. Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Medical Services (Orlando Fire Department) and Orlando Regional Medical Center.\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan CFPL Orlando Terminal - Orlando Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping and three butane storage vessels.\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan CFPL Orlando Terminal - Orlando Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer (Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P.). \n\n\n\nAs this is a new system, this facility has never had an accident involving the butane process which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Kinder Morgan CFPL Orlando Terminal - Orlando Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the faci"
