Facility accidental release and emergeency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of C-D FARM SERVICE CO. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 120,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 120,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.3 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 mile.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted b"

Five year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n    - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n    - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property\n      damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nThe facility has:\n\n    - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n      as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including\n       pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nA.  Safety improvement is a on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nB.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  In [2000] we plan to do extensive maintenance and upgrade the facility to meet new state regulations for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia."
