We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Methylmethacrylate (MMA) using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Another part of the facility regenerates spent material for reintroduction into the MMA process.   In our processes, there are 2 chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release, one toxic chemical (Oleum) and one flammable chemical (trimethylamine).\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the ha"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n*  Containment dike\n*  Overfill / overpressure process control interlocks\n*  Emergency shutdown procedures\n*  Comprehensive process training programs for operations personnel\n*  Crisis management drills\n*  Emergency response measures\n*  Comprehensive written operating procedures\n*  Agressive preventive maintenance\n*  Routine hazard reviews\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nLucite keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  Each incident of this type  is formally investigated to identify and correct the root cause of the event. The EPA's definition of accidental release is one that results in death, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, shelter-in-place or environmental damage.  \n\nThere have been no significant accidental chemical releases involving RMP chemicals at the Beaumont site in the "
