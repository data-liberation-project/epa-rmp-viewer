It is situated on a 74-acre property surrounded by light industry, commercial establishments, and residences. We manufacture 10 different types of chemical products, 95 percent of which are consumed in the US, and the rest are sold on the international market.\n\nOur products include several chemicals used to solve problem properties of fabrics, so that fabrics are stronger, softer, shrink-free, and release soil easily; have durable press; have no dye migration or bleeding; and can be water repellant and flame retardant. Other related products strengthen adhesives and paper products. We also make sulfated oils, which are used extensively in making textile, leather, pulp and paper, paint and coatings, and personal care products. They are useful as bleaching assistants, lubricants, defoamers, dyeing assistants, emulsifiers, dispersants, rheology modifiers, and emollients. Much of the sulfated oil chemistry is based on naturally occurring oils which make them easily biodegradable.\n\nAt the Charlotte Plant, we have approximately 23 employees \n\nOur plant uses one chemical that brings us under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule. This is a 50% formaldehyde solution, which poses a toxic vapor release hazard under the RMP Rule. In the past we had  the capability to utilize a 20,000 gallon storage tank for storing Formaldehyde. However,our efforts to reduce formaldehyde usage have enabled the site to only bring in a maximum one tanker truck of 50% formaldehyde on an as needed basis, at which time it is completely consumed into a mixed batch of Formaldehyde and Glyoxal. From there the mix of the two raw materials is used to produce what is left of the Charlotte Plant's formaldehyde-containing product lines.\n\nThe types"

We have long understood the relationship between good safety and good business, as reflected by our exemplary safety performance. \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\n\nIt is the policy at the Charlotte Plant to meet and often exceed requirements established by applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local agencies. Our safety policies and practices have historically preceded the regulation of such practices under, for example, the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and the EPA\nRMP Rule. Our policy is to maintain at a practical minimum, the potential for harm to on-site employees and contractors, the public, and the environment, and to have in place contingency actions, coordinated with local responding agencies, for the unlikely event of a serious accidental chemical release.\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Charlotte Plant has in place a thorough, ongoing PSM Program. This program calls for implementation and maintenance of procedural and engineered safeguards at the plant to minimize the likelihood of a significant release of a hazardous chemical, and to eliminate or reduce the effects of any release that might occur.\n\nWe are involved in day-to-day safety-focused activities under our program that include elements such as:\n(1)\tProcess Hazard Analyses - We routinely perform and maintain up-to-date, systematic, and thorough studies of our operations to identify what could go wrong, identify means of eliminating or reducing design or procedural weaknesses, and to implement improvements.\n(2)\tProcess Design - Our processes and equipment are designed for safety in accordance with applicable industry standards and best engineering practices."

They also receive refresher training periodically. Our procedures for operating and maintaining processes, general safe work practices, and emergency response are fully documented and maintained up-to-date in light of any changes at the plant. \n(4)\tMaintenance - Each item of equipment at our plant that is involved in maintaining safety or in responding to an abnormal situation is inspected, tested, and/or maintained on a frequency that reflects its service and condition.\n(5)\tManagement of Change - No change to equipment or procedural practices can take place at the plant without a thorough review of the implications of that change to safety. No change must adversely impact the safety built into the design and operations of our processes.\n\nOur PSM Program is tuned to reflect the specific hazards of the chemicals we use. For example, our operating, maintenance, safe work, and emergency procedures address personal protective equipment appropriate to the chemicals being handled. Also, equipment is selected based on its intended service and chemical exposures.\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n\nWe have had no events at the Charlotte Plant that would qualify for inclusion in the RMP Rule's five year accident history.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nWe have in place a written Emergency Response Plan that we coordinate with the West Mecklenburg Volunteer Fire Department (VFD), which is backed up by the Charlotte Fire Department. New personnel are trained on the plan; we conduct refresher training annually; and we train on any revisions to the plan. The plan is in compliance with the RMP Rule requirements, as well as other app"
