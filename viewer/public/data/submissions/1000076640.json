The LEPC response plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan for the site which describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment and provides the contact information for emergency response organizations. A site map, MSDSs, and a list of chemicals are kept at the facility. The Emergency Action Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes to the facility and the covered process, and the employees are informed of changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Silo Gas Plant is coordinated with the Laramie County Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Silo Gas Plant Manager has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\nG) Plan"

A team of both management and plant personnel (and sometimes a third-party auditor) participates in the audit. The audit team develops findings that are shared with Silo Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are traced until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\n4) Summary of Process Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe process at the Silo Gas Plant has hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operations. The Silo Gas Plant has safety features to help 1) quickly detect a release, 2) contain/control a release and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\na) Release detection - Hydrocarbon detectors and alarms (carried by personnel)\r\n\r\nb) Release containment/control\r\n1. Valves to permit isolation of the process\r\n2. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high temperature, high pressure)\r\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n4. Atmospheric pressure relief devices\r\n\r\nc) Release Mitigation\r\n1. Personal protective equipment\r\n2. Spacing of equipment in accordance with Industrial Risk Insurer's spacing guideline\r\n3. Emergency shutdowns strategically placed in the plant to automatically shut in the inlet.\r\n\r\nD) Off-Site Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest storage vessel containing approximately 125,000 pounds of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) mixture.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or similar incident. The investigator documents his/her findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to Kaiser-Frontier management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a release does occur, procedures are in place to secure the facility and notify the appropriate response personnel. In addition to the facility's Emergency Action Plan, the Silo Gas Plant is included in the community response plan maintained by the Laramie County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).\r\n\r\nB) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Silo Gas Plant is located 15 miles northeast of Cheyenne, Wyoming approximately 1 mile south of the intersection of County Road 222 and 136. It incorporates a variety of equipment to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas, propane, butane, pentane, etc.) from oil and gas wells.  The Silo Plant handles methane, ethane, propane, pentane and butane which are regulated flammable substances. Its rated capacity is 15 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas.\r\n\r\nThe maximum intended inventory on-site of natural gas liquids is operationally limited to approximately 113,000 gallons or 547,700 pounds.  Currently there are four storage bullet tanks at the facility with approximately 123,000 pounds of storage capacity each.  Propane is used as a refrigerant, and the maximum intended inventory is 32,200 pounds. \r\n\r\nCondensate is a mixed flammable liquid that is stored in bulk and subject to OSHA's PSM program, but does not contain substantive amounts of RMP regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Silo Plant does not use, process or store a threshold quantity of toxic regulated substan"
