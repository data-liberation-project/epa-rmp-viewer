The Facility produces and stores ice cream products. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration systems at the Facility. PLM has developed a California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in general accordance with the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, and Federal EPA requirements, 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan (RMP), and federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119 and California OSHA 8 CCR 5189 to enhance already existing anhydrous ammonia safety and emergency action programs. PLM Operations, LLC was purchased by Tropicale Foods, LLC in 2018. The management team is committed to worker and public safety through investment in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems. PLM\u0092s policy is to implement reasonable controls to reduce foreseeable releases of regulated substances. PLM relies on support services provided by the local fire department and the Stanislaus County Hazardous Materials Response team in the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the Facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \nPLM has two anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems at the Facility: the Versaline System and the Plant System. The two systems are defined as one process due to an interconnection at the purger which is opened periodically during normal operation. An ammonia leak detection system and an ammonia diffusion tank are ancillary systems that support the process.\n\nThe Versaline system utilizes approximatel"

The Versaline System is composed of the following key components:\n 1 Condenser\n 1 Control Pressure Receiver\n 1 Oil pot\n 1 FES compressor \n 1 Chiller evaporator with an accumulator vessel\n 1 Liquid transfer vessel (LTV)\n\nThe Versaline System operation cycle begins at the control-pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed to the chiller evaporator. At this point, the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then is pumped from the chiller evaporator where it absorbs heat from the brine. Vapor is returned to the compressor and compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the control-pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n \nThe Plant System has two different operating pressures and temperatures with an estimated inventory of approximately 11,100 pounds. One operating pressure has a corresponding temperature of 20 degrees F and is referred to as the medium temperature. The medium temperature equipment serves both air handlers on the roof and the 34-degree cold box. The second operating pressure has a corresponding temperature of -50 degrees F and serves the two -15-degree freezers for product storage, four ice cream freezers, and one spiral quick freeze tunnel.

As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as PLM continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. PLM will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the CalARP/RMP/PSM Programs, related attachments, and program elements will be incorporated consistent with PLM\u0092s internal review practices, and PLM will maintain the most current versions onsite. Thus, the most current version of the CalARP/RMP/PSM Programs and related documents and elements maintained onsite may vary slightly from the information in submittals made to regulatory agencies."
