      "SummaryText": "J.G. Boswell Company's farming operations utilize chlorine in their crop production activities in the preparation for, and the treatment of, crops and land, to control and prevent the following: harmful bacteria and other harmful organisms that may be present in the source water from infecting the trees and crops; to control algae buildup in the lines and root zone area of the crop; to prevent organic matter from clogging the emitters and affecting the distribution uniformity of water supplied to the crop, thereby preventing crop failure and/or tree death; and to buffer (lower) the pH of the source water to increase the bio-availability of nutrients. The Chlorination systems incorporate many inherently safe design features. These features include fail safe (vacuum open and spring close) flow valves in the vacuum feed regulator and ejectors that are normally closed. As such, the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\nWhile it is J.G. Boswell Company's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited personnel in the farming operation precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the J.G. Boswell Company farming operations where chlorine is used, or stored, and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\n\n\nJ.G. Boswell Company has developed a detailed Program 3 Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the California Accidental Release Program, and Federal Accidental Release Program regulations.  At least every three years, J.G. Boswell Company will audit these programs and any findings of noncompliance will be documented, and responded to, and the deficiencies will be corrected.\n\n"
