Hillis St.\nFrankfort, IN 46041 \nFebruary 26, 1999\n\nFor further Information contact: Norm Huffer, Plant Manager\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1. The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Hillisburg Agronomy are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2. Facility Information\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers fro the sale to farmers.\n    -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n    -The maximum quantity stored would be 52,000 pounds in our one-12,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 154,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.   The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.13 miles.\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n5. The Five-year Accident History \n     a.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n    -  have caused any deaths, injuries, or si"

The emergency response program\n    - The facility has:\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 DFR 1910.38;\n    c. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know                             information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n    d. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.12,                                                          including pre-emergency and employee training.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
