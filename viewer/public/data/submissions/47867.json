If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\n     The primary activity at the facility is storage.  Anhydrous         ammonia is received, stored, and used to neutralize the water before it is sent to the treatment plant after the manufacturing of liquid feed.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\r\n\r\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 4.4 miles.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\r\n\r\n     The distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .3 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n     This facility complies with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of th"
