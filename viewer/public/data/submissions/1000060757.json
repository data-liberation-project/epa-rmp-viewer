The facility has on-site support to coordinate health, safety and environmental programs.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operation, maintenance and training for affected processes.  In the event that any unforeseeable release might still occur, the facility coordinates emergency response primarily with local fire departments.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance(s)\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures various foam products.  The foam manufacturing process uses regulated flammable gas as a blowing agent.  The maximum inventory of blowing agent at the facility exceeds the 10,000-lb RMP threshold.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSummarized below is a brief description of the facility?s program elements:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains process safety information that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nIn order to identify and then control the hazards of the process, the facility has performed a What-If/Checklist analysis using a team of qualified personnel and led by a qualified outside consultant.  The hazard review is updated at least every 5 years or when major changes are made.  The findings are addressed in a timely manner and documented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nTo ensure the covered process is operated safely, written operating instructions have been developed, maintained and made available to operators.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as start-up, shutdown, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and emergency operation.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility trains employees that operate covered processes initially, as c"

The work is performed by trained maintenance personnel and the equipment includes storage tanks, piping systems, relief vent and vent systems, control pumps, etc.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten Management of Change procedures are maintained at the facility, which cover changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Operating and maintenance personnel affected by changes are made aware of the changes and trained as needed.\n\n\n\nPre-Start Up Safety Reviews\n\nThese reviews are conducted for initial startups and following modifications.  The reviews confirm that construction, equipment and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing the equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nAudits will be conducted to ensure that the provisions of PSM and RMP are being implemented.  Any necessary corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFacility personnel promptly investigate any incident that has or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  The investigations seek to identify root causes and any corrective actions necessary to prevent recurrences.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe facility occasionally uses outside contractors to perform specialized maintenance or construction activities.  Hazards that could be encountered related to the covered process are reviewed as well as site-specific safety rules and emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe affected process at the facility is equipped with various process controls and mitigation systems such as relief valves, check valves, automatic shutoffs, alarms, etc. and maintains operating procedures to decrease the potential for a release event. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have bee"
