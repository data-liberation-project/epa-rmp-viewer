Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe VPC - Grubb Lease Gas Plant is located at 3055 West Pacific Coast Highway, Ventura, California 93001, approximately 1.3 miles north east of the Pacific Coast Highway.\n\n\n\nThe Grubb Lease Gas Plant has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). The Grubb Lease Gas Plant is extremely diligent and committed in the handling of all flammables and chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as personnel training, building safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  The Vintage philosophy is to implement engineering and administrative controls to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances; as well as non-regulated substances. The Program 1 process exclusively includes Natural Gas Liquid.\n\n\n\nThe Plant is Process Safety Management (PSM) Normally Unoccupied Remote Facility (NURF) exempt. Plant operations and/or employees will not average more than 1.5 man-hours per day and a total of 14.5 man-hours per week. However, the use of a Management of Change procedure is in place as well as an Equipment Reliability program.\n\n\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, and isobutane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities establish by this regulation.\n\n\n\n1.2. Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nAs the Vintage Grubb Lease Emergency Response Plan incorporates coordination with local emergency response agencies as well as the use of employees trained to recognize and respond to the hazards of a chemical release and the use of response procedures to mitigat"

The highest priority in an emergency response is for the safety of responding emergency personnel as well as affected and non-affected company and contract personnel.  Response procedures are implemented according to what appropriate is based on a hazard assessment performed at the scene of the incident.  Vintage will always attempt to have a Joint Incident Command structure in place to assist emergency response personnel in the immediate control of any release. Priorities for response are based on life, environment and property, in that order.\n\n\n\nManagement supports the safety of the plant by having a Production Technician inspect the plant daily.  Employees are provided annual training in HAZWOPER 29 CFR 1910.120, Emergency Action Plans 29 CFR 1910.38, (including tabletop drills that periodically include local emergency response agencies depending on their availability), Hazard Communication 29 CFR 1910.1200, Fire Prevention Plans 29 CFR 1910.39 and Injury and Illness Prevention Plan Cal/OSHA Title 8, Section 3203.  \n\n\n\n1.3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCalARP Program 1 does not require a Prevention Program. However, Vintage has implemented specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases or regulated (and other) substances at the Grubb Lease Gas Plant.  The following is some of the control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at Grubb Lease Gas Plant:\n\n ? Relief and/or safety valves on vessels (One safety valve with high flow valve)\n\n ? Static Grounding\n\n ? Shutdown devices for equipment exceeding operating parameters\n\n ? Field compressor call out alarm for pressure increase\n\n ? On-site fire extinguishers for incipient stage fire control\n\n ? Fail Safe operation design \n\nCommon industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being perform"

Five Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of Natural Gas Liquid at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5.    Toxic: Worst Case \n\nThe use of toxic materials at the Vintage - Grubb Lease Gas Plant is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\n\n\n1.6.    Toxic: Alternative Release\n\nThe use of toxic materials at the Vintage - Grubb Lease Gas Plant is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\n\n\n1.7.    Emergency Response Program \n\nVintage - Grubb Lease Gas Plant has written emergency response procedures to address hazards that may be encountered during response or follow-up of an emergency at the Grubb Lease Gas Plant.  These emergency response procedures address the following issues: 1) releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of fires or explosions; 2) proper emergency rescue, first aid and medical treatment for exposure; 3) notification of local emergency response agencies; 4) evacuation plans for the Grubb Lease Gas Plant and methods of accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation; and 5) post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Grubb Lease Gas Plant follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms on a routine basis.\n\n\n\nWritten emergency response procedures are in compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plans.  Training on the emergency response plan enhances the preparedness of employees to recognize and respond to any release of hazardous chemicals.  The emergency response procedures provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies including prevention, preparedness, hazard assessment, response, rescue, decontamination and follow-up procedures. \n\n\n\n1.8.
