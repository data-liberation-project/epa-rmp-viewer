Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nOdom?s Tennessee Pride Country Sausage, Inc has a long established policy requiring its staff and management to undertake those measures and activities necessary to ensure the safety of its employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors from harm associated with its operations.  With respect to the potential exposure to anhydrous ammonia contained in the refrigeration system at the Madison, Tennessee facility, appropriate monitoring, maintenance and upgrade of all system equipment will be performed in a timely manner to prevent the release of ammonia from the system.  That policy also limits operation and maintenance of the system to appropriately trained and qualified personnel only.\n\nIn the event of a release, Odom?s staff trained to provide emergency response will respond immediately to stop, control and mitigate any release.  Notification of a release will be made to appropriate outside agencies and emergency response organizations.\n\nII.    Source and Substances Handled\n\nThe stationary source consists of a two-stage mechanical refrigeration system that employs anhydrous ammonia.  The system contains approximately 11,750 pounds of the material.\n\nIII.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility implements an ongoing inspection and maintenance program to minimize the potential for malfunction/failure of the refrigeration system components that could potentially result in a release of ammonia.  In addition, a computer based system is used to continuously monitor the components of the refrigeration system and ensure that they are operated within the appropriate limits.
