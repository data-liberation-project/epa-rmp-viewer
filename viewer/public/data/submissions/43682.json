(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  ONEOK\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionator receives demethanized mix from several pipelines and fractionates this mix into five separate products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The products are then delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane as well as natural gasoline as a flammable mixture, are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Mont Belvieu Fractionator.  At the facility, we have no toxic chemicals above threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\u00bfOperating in compliance w"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that combustion of hydrocarbon vapors would be interrupted by installing automatic pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare.\n\u00bfInstalling heat-activated sprinkler system in the compressor rooms.\n\u00bfInstalling hydrocarbon detectors in the compressor room to help ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00bfPreventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\u00bfProviding employees and contractors with an orientation on facility operations to help ensure personal safety.\n\u00bfProviding a fire water system to help ensure quick response to fires.\n\u00bfProviding high level alarms on bullet tanks in order to reduce the possibility of overfilling.  \n\u00bfInstalling a fire detection system in the compressor building.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a release of an RMP substance has occurred at the Mont B"

The Mont Belvieu Facility Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drills, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\u00bfThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\u00bfInternal and third party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n\u00bfAn ongoing dialogue with the Chambers County Emergency Management Director or his desig"
