      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nCORN, LP\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nCORN, LP has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nCORN, LP 's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will implement emergency actions to contain the release as necessary.  The facility will coordinate with the Goldfield Fire Department for response to a release.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nCORN, LP ethanol plant is located in Goldfield, Wright County, Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant(also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture). CORN, LP has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 6.9  miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on site.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenarios at the facility includes the release of two different chemicals.  The first is the release of all 159,000 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud.  The second worst case scenario is the release of all 963,600 pounds of denaturant consisting of 313,170 pounds of reportable chemicals causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \r\n\r\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 6.9 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools and other public receptors are located within t"

The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\r\n\r\nAlthough CORN, LP has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of CORN, LP.\r\n\r\nEmergency Action Plan Information:\r\n\r\nCORN, LP ethanol plant has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency actions, including an emergency action plan.  An SPCC has been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and timeframes.\r\n\r\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  CORN, LP's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities."
