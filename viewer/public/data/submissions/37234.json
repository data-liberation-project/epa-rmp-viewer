This Plant is one of six water and\r\nWastewater Plants operated by the City. Wastewater Plant#2 and \r\nfour other plants have quanties of regulated hazardous \r\nchemicals above the EPA threshold. The City has a unified Risk\r\nManagement Program which applies to each plant. Only\r\nWastewater Treatment Plant #2 operations and policies are \r\npresented in this Plan.\r\n\r\nWastewater Treatment #2 uses two regulated substances chlorine \r\n(CAS Number 7782-50-5)in the chlorination process.\r\nThe chlorination process consists of the use of chlorine from \r\none-ton cylinders to disinfect treated wastewater.\r\nThe other regulated substance is Sulfur dioxide (Cas Number 7446-09-5)\r\n used in the dechlorination process.\r\nThe sulfur dioxide process consist of the use of sulfur dioxide \r\nfrom one-ton clyinders for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program\r\n(RMP), the facility has developed an accidental\r\nrelease prevention program and emergency action plan for the facility.\r\nThe accidental release prevention program\r\nsatisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational \r\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA)\r\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program \r\nensures that the facility is operated under safe\r\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due to human \r\nerror, the facility's prevention program ensures that\r\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.Training also \r\nplays a vital part in the facility's program.\r\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process\r\nor sulfur dioxide process are required \r\nto be trained in the chlorination process an"

      "SummaryText": "d sulfur dioxide process \r\nand the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in a release, the\r\nprogram ensures that equipment inspections, tests, and\r\npreventive maintenance are performed in accordance with accepted \r\nengineering practices, manufacturer's\r\nrecommendations, and planned maintenance schedules.  All chlorine \r\nand sulfur dioxide cylinders are examined upon \r\ndelivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage. In addition,\r\nequipment pertaining to the chlorine process and\r\nthe sulfur dioxide process is visually inspected daily.  The potential\r\nfor a chlorine, or sulfur dioxide release \r\nis greatly reduced in the chlorination, and dechlorination process \r\ndue to the use of a vacuum system from point of \r\nchlorine and sulfur dioxide withdrawal to its point of application.\r\nIn the event that there is a failure in \r\nchlorination or sulfur dioxide equipment, the system will automatically \r\nshut down (i.e., failsafe).\r\n\r\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination and sulfur dioxide \r\nequipment have been designed according to applicable\r\nstandards and codes.The facility maintains records and documentation\r\non equipment inspection and tests.Precautions \r\nare taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected \r\nand tested, that all changes on the process are \r\nauthorized, and employees are informed of changes.\r\n\r\nThe facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address\r\nthe hazards in the chlorination and sulfur dioxide \r\nprocess to evaluate and control where potential for a chlorine or \r\nsulfur dioxide release exists.  \r\nEmployees were involved in determining hazards of the process and \r\nsubsequent consequences.  The chlorination\r\nand sulfur dioxide process was found to be operating safely and no \r\nchanges were recommended.\r\n\r\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at\r\nthe facility.  Employees have been assigned various\r\ntasks to ensure that all elements of"

      "SummaryText": "the RMP are implemented.  The\r\nfacility has developed management forms to\r\nassist employees in recording and documenting the various elements \r\nof the RMP.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Program, there \r\nhave been no accidental releases of chlorine\r\nor sulfur dioxide at this facility in the past five years. However, \r\nin the event that there is an accidental release of \r\nchlorine, or sulfur dioxide an Emergency Action Plan has been written\r\nin compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The facility is \r\nalso included in the community emergency response plan. Employees at \r\nthe facility do not respond to accidental releases\r\nof chlorine, or sulfur dioxide but coordinate with outside responders. \r\nTherefore, an Emergency Response\r\nProgram is not required for the facility.  In the event that a chlorine \r\nor sulfur dioxide release occurs, all employees \r\nare required to evacuate the process area and report the incident. \r\nThe emergency action plan consists of evacuation\r\nprocedures,facility emergency numbers, and coordination with the City \r\nof Jacksonville Fire Department. The plan also addresses\r\nnotification procedures to the public and the local emergency response agency."
