We at the Belmont Water Treatment Plant (Belmont WTP) use chemicals too.  For example, we use chlorine to disinfect our water to provide safe drinking water for human consumption.  Storing large quantities of chlorine can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as we do providing the public safe, disinfected drinking water.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in event of an emergency.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and  Emergency Response Policies\nThe Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) and Belmont WTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \nThis document complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The Belmont WTP has a chlorination system that uses chlorine gas fed from ton cylinders. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The Belmont WTP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potential accidental releases that is designed to safeguard both on- and off-site pe"

To date, we have had an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe Belmont WTP, operating since 1966, is located at 4300 Ford Road in the City of Philadelphia. The plant is located on property between the Ford Road and Belmont Avenue in Philadelphia.  Surface water taken from the Schuylkill River is treated and disinfected at the Belmont WTP to EPA standards and sent to the public for human consumption. This water treatment process includes preliminary screening, coagulation and sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination before final distribution to the public. The Belmont WTP produces up to 86 million gallons per day (MGD) of potable water, with an average flow of 46 MGD.\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regulated toxic substance under 40 CFR Part 68 - RMP. The Plant's chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds in the RMP Regulations. \nLiquid chlorine is brought to the plant via delivery trucks that drop off the ton containers at the chlorine loading/unloading area. Chlorine leak detector monitors continuously check for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorination rooms. Other indicators include chlorine feed and evaporator alarms. These alarms are annunciated at the central and local control panels at the plant in the main control room. In the case of a leak, the storage area has an audible alarm and red flashing warning light on top of the building.  In addition, an evaporator shut-off and pressure reducing valve is designed to close if low evaporator gas temperature is detected; thus preventing liquid chlorine from reaching the gas piping system.  These valves also reduce pressure and allow for quicker liquefaction to occur.  All process related, factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the integrity of the equipment.\nThe ton cylinder usage area and the chlorination rooms are enclosed in a building.  Both buildings "

      "SummaryText": "are equipped with an automatic chlorine scrubber system that activates when the chlorine leak detector detects 2 ppm of either chlorine in the room. Room air is vented to a scrubber that neutralizes the gases.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are provided at each building.  The main control building has Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBAs) available.   \nThe Belmont WTP is controlled at State Road by a gate that is only open during normal working hours.  Visitors and contractors must check-in at the administration building and be approved by Belmont WTP staff prior to entry into the facility.  The plant is manned 24-hours a day, year round, and alarms notify staff of any problems or situations that require follow-up investigations at all times.      \nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios. The worst case scenario assumes that the entire content of the largest single container of chlorine is released, regardless of how improbable that may be.  In addition, only \"passive\" mitigation methods, such as buildings or dikes (for liquids) can be considered.  Passive mitigation, as defined, requires no mechanical, electrical, or human input. The regulations require that the worst case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas.\n An alternative release scenario is also required.  \nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine is focused on the ton cylinders that store chlorine liquid. The scenario used for Belmont WTP is the rupture of one chlorine cylinder with a maximum capacity of 2000 lbs, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration. There are chlorine cylinders stored outdoors at times, so no building mitigation factor can be applied at Belmont WTP. The release rate for this scenario is 200 pounds per minute (lbs/min).    \nThe cylinder r"

      "SummaryText": "upture resulting in a chlorine release could be caused by catastrophic events, such as an earthquake or a fire. In practice this type of total release of a ton cylinder would be unlikely and never occur during the lifetime of the plant. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an offsite impact.\nThe alternative release reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur, as compared to the worst case scenario.  Unlike the worst case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation, such as automatic shutoff valves and scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.  Lastly, the alternative release scenario assumes more realistic regional and seasonal meteorology.\nBased on the process hazard analysis performed for the chlorine system, several alternative release scenarios were selected.  Unlike the worst case release scenario, active controls can be applied to minimize the leak or impacts.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The scenario used for chlorine was a failure of the fusible plugs on the ton cylinder with mitigation provided by the storage building. Under this scenario, the amount of chlorine released was calculated to be 74.6 lbs/min. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the worst alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a slight offsite impact. \nFive-year Accident History Summary\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazards to any individuals at on-site or off-site locations (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at Belmont WTP during the last five years. \nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps \nBelmont WTP is in compliance with Federal Risk Management Planning (RMP) requirements.

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers.  The HA technique used was the \"What-If\" scenario and process checklist procedure, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. The HA was lead by knowledgeable persons on the type of process being reviewed.  This review will be updated again within a five-year period, or whenever there is major change in the process.  A list of actions to resolve any found significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff is currently working to resolve this action item list.  Staff will document completion of any action item.\nOperating Procedures\nBelmont WTP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. Belmont WTP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation.  Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to avoid and correct deviations.  Belmont WTP will update procedures whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.
