Additionally, an AHF tank car may be on site for unloading purposes.  AHF is used in the manufacture of fluorine and the conversion of uranium dioxide to uranium tetrafluoride.\n\nAmmonia (NH3) is stored in tank farm facilities in two storage vessels.  Additionally, an NH3 tank car may be on-site for unloading purposes.  NH3 is for the production of hydrogen gas, which is consumed on-site for the reduction of uranium ore concentrates to uranium dioxide.\n\nLiquid fluorine is produced and stored in insulated trailers.  It is cooled with liquid nitrogen contained in a jacket that surrounds the product container.  Liquid fluorine is produced as needed for the manufacture of iodine pentafluoride and antimony pentafluoride.\n\nWorst-case and Alternate Release Scenarios and Administrative and Mitigation Controls in Place to Limit \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthe Impact of the Release\n-------------------------------\n\n+  EPA's Risk Management Program requires the Metropolis plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation.  EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release is assumed to take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\n\n+  In addition, the Metropolis plant is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario.\n\n>   Worst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\nA release of 180,0"

In addition, the following 3 chemicals at Metropolis can form hydrogen fluoride through their reaction with water vapor:  iodine pentafluoride, antimony pentafluoride and uranium hexafluoride.\n\n' Due to a split in a hose, 320 pounds of liquid anhydrous ammonia would be released through an orifice having a diameter of 2 inches.

The release has an off-site impact.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n-----------------------------\n\nThere have been no releases of RMP listed chemicals in the last five years; however, within the last five years there have been releases of iodine pentafluoride and uranium hexafluoride which, when released into the atmosphere, generate hydrogen fluoride.\n\nIn May, 1995, 2000 pounds of iodine pentafluoride were released.  On site, sixteen (16) people received plant first-aid treatment.   In October 1997, 5 grams of iodine Pentafluoride were released.  One minor HF burn occurred to one person on-site.  The following improvements were identified and implemented in response to these events:\n\n1. Installed manually operated remote shutdown stations\n2. Installed HF monitors with automatic shutdown and vent closure capability\n3. Installed new scrubber to reduce fugitive and release emissions\n4. Installed instrument upgrades\n5. Installed fence line HF monitors\n\nIn January 1998, three people were treated for minor HF burns after 33 grams of uranium hexafluoride were released.  More rigorous procedures for handling uranium hexafluoride have been implemented and check lists have been developed to insure compliance with these procedures.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n--------------------------------------\n\nMetropolis Works has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for chemical releases.  In the event of an emergency, a plant siren is sounded and personnel evacuated to certain plant areas for head count.   Emergency response personnel are directed  to the area of the emergency where they provide assistance as necessary.  In the event of a release that will impact the public, the Crisis Manager will coordinate off-site emergency response through the Massac County 911 emergency system.

The Sheriff will coordinate activities with the Illinois State Police that may be necessary as the result of the plant emergency. The ESDA Coordinator is responsible for the sounding of eight community sirens.   The sirens are sounded in accordance with the Metropolis-Massac County Emergency Services and Disaster Agency -Massac County Siren System Procedure.  \n\nThe Metropolis Works Emergency Response Team consists of approximately  60 people.  Each person is given 24 hours of  initial emergency response training  and 24 hours of refresher each year.  MSDS's (Material Safety Data Sheets) are reviewed at Plant Safety meetings and are available in operating manuals. Additionally, MSDS's for Plant chemicals are supplied to the local fire department.   Approximately 100 plant personnel are trained in first aid and given refresher training each year. Each of the local hospitals is trained in HF first aid treatment and contamination control.\n\nPlant and community sirens are tested for operation monthly.  Plant emergency response headcount drills are provided quarterly and at least one major scenario drill coordinating off-site and on-site response is performed yearly. \n\n\nGeneral Accident and Chemical Specific Accident Prevention Program\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe general accident prevention for a Program 3 RMP facility is very comprehensive, consisting of twelve elements.  These elements are part of Occupational Safety and Health Act - Process Safety Management Regulations (OSHA 1910.119). Metropolis Works is in compliance with OSHA 1910.119. The general accident prevention elements are as follows."

      "SummaryText": "e Care is designed to prevent fires, explosions and accidental chemical releases.  The code requires safety audits, inspection and maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\nPlant equipment and facilities have been designed and installed to operate safely.  Periodic safety reviews are performed by Hazard Review Committees, by corporate environmental and safety audit teams, and by various regulatory agencies.  Emergency preparedness and response plans have been developed, most notably the Radiological Contingency Plan and the Emergency Response Plan, and training has been given to in-plant personnel.  A full drill is held at least annually to test the effectiveness of the plans. The Emergency Response Plan is directed through the local ESDA (Emergency Services Disaster Agency) Coordinator for off-site response.  \n\nThe Metropolis Works (MTW) Plant Manager participates actively in the UF6 (uranium hexafluoride) Safety Working Group.  This group consists of the world's five major UF6 converters.  Once per year, this group meets and discusses items of mutual concern involving safety.  This group has helped to spread the best practices of each converter to all other converters, thereby enhancing the safety of all five operations. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoneywell/Metropolis Works produces uranium hexafluoride, sulfur hexafluoride, iodine pentafluoride, antimony pentafluoride, and liquid fluorine.  Liquid fluorine is produced for internal consumption only; all others are chemicals that we sell.  Operations to produce these chemicals are continuous and operate on a 24-hour basis.  In the production processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significan"

A new pollution control device is being installed that has the capability of removing and scrubbing releases in these manufacturing areas.\n\nThe HF unloading facility presently has three (3) storage vessels, a tank car and associated piping.  The present safety system includes remote activated valves on the tank car unloading valves and on storage transfer lines, and alternate tank with air pollution prevention system to receive the entire contents of a storage vessel, as well as an outlet for HF exiting vessel relief valves and rupture discs.  The Metropolis Works is presently evaluating additional HF mitigation techniques including water spray mitigation, enclosures for HF storage and tank car unloading, refrigerated storage of HF and combinations of these."
