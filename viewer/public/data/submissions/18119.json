Continuing efforts and constant improvement to programs and operations will allow us to extend our safety record.  \n\nDescription     \n\nThe stationary source, our ammonia refrigeration system, consists of various pumps, compressors, condensers, and piping that are used to change the physical state of anhydrous ammonia from a gas to a liquid to freeze vegetables and to maintain cold room temperatures is a closed system.  The stationary source has two systems or processes which are designated as the Main and the Max system.  The total ammonia inventory at the Green Bay Facility is 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The largest process is charged with 25,000 pounds of ammonia.\nThere is 19,100 square feet under refrigeration.  The ammonia systems are used in the freezing of green beans, carrots, potatoes and peas."

In this way we promote overall plant, worker, environmental and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to reduce the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs reduce the risk of accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and help to minimize physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any and all activities that involve hazardous chemical usage including any use, storage, manufacture, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or a combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered one process.  There are 2 such groups of vessels at the Green Bay Facility.  They are designated as the Main engine room and the Max engine room.  As previously described, all of the interconnected equipment will be considered as one process.  Specifically, the Max, Center, East, New East, and the North freezing tunnels are considered as part of the processes.\n\nOur safety programs, preventive maintenance schedules, and shift inspections minimize accidents by maintaining the mechanical integrity of the processes.  These programs focus on rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These programs ar"
