OF TRIBUNE IS AN AGRICULTURAL RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH SPECIALIZES IN GRAIN STORAGE AND THE SALE OF AGRICULTURAL INPUTS FOR CROP ENHANCEMENT.\n\nOUR NH3 PLANT CONSIST OF 2-12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS WHICH COMPRISE A TOTAL CAPACITY OF 106,000 POUNDS WIHEN FILLED TO 85% CAPACITY.  WE MAINTAIN ALL OF OUR STORAGE TANKS IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  OUR PLANT IS INSPECTED ANNUALLY BY THE KANSAS DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE FACILITY.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD SEE A TOTAL RELEASE OF THE LARGEST TANK AND WOULD HAVE A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF1.63 MILES AFFECTED APPROXIMATELY 10 AREA RESIDENTS.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE CAUSED BY A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE WOULD RELEASE 11,908 POUNDS IN A TWO MINUTE PERIOD WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF .83 MILES.  IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT 6 CITIZENS.\n\nALL EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AROUND ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ARE TRAINED ANNUALLY IN THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF NH3, AS WELL AS THE HAZARDS, MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING PROCEDURES SET FORTH BY THE COMPANY.  EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR THE APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (GOGGLES AND GLOVES) WHEN FILLING NURSE TANKS.  CLEAN SAFETY WATER IS MANDITORY DURING ANHYDROUS AMMONIA OPERATIONS.\n\nOUR TRAINING RECORD AND EMPHASIS MAKES IT EASY TO REPORT THAT NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURRED AT THIS FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  ALSO, A TOUR OF THE AMMONIA FACILITY HAS BEEN SCHEDULED TO DISCUSSED WITH THE FIRST RESPONDERS  THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THE FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
