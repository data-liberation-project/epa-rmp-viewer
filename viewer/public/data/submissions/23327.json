ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n   AES Cayuga LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment against the hazards of an unintentional ammonia release. The safety and health of all employees and the public is very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n    The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The AES Cayuga LLC PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage\" our ammonia based process rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     AES Cayuga LLC believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Operators and Maintenance personnel, will be deeply involved in the PSM/RMP program development, implementation and integration and they will assume a major responsibility for operating the ammonia process safely.\n\n     The AES Cayuga LLC Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Lansing Volunteer Fire Department.  All  AES Cayuga LLC employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     AES Cayuga LLC operates a Fossil Fuel Power Generating Station.  Ammonia is used to control NOx emissions in their stack gas.   Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in amounts above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.

The distance of travel for the generated ammonia vapor cloud has been calculated\n     and the information is available from Plant Management.\n\n     A WORST CASE release is very, very, very, unlikely to occur during the life of the facility, this is\n     because  of the release prevention and mitigation features incorporated in the AES Cayuga LLC\n     PSM/RMP program.\n\n     An alternative case release scenario that we call WORST CASE CREDIBLE was slightly more likely.\n     An ammonia vapor release from a failed pressure relief valve or from ammonia vapor piping \n     was considered.  The distance to the Toxic Endpoint under worst case weather conditions has been\n     calculated.  The information is available from AES Management on a need to know basis.   This release\n     scenario is also  very, very unlikely to occur during the life of the facility.\n\n     A second alternative scenario was also considered which we call MOST LiIKELY, MOST SEVER. \n     This scenario considered the release of ammonia from a ruptured ammonia loading hose during the\n     tank fill operation.  The distance to the Toxic Endpoint under worst case weather conditions has been\n     calculated.  The information is available from AES Management on a need to know basis.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact,\n     or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     AES Cayuga employees have been trained to respond to an accidental ammonia release.
