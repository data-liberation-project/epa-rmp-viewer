The SLG process which\nis subject to 40 CFR Part 58 is the receiving, storage, transfer, and pressurization of a 2Qaerosol container, utilizing an aerosol grade propellant (100% 1,1 Difluoroethane), trade name 152A.  Written operating procedures requiring daily personal and mechanical monitoring are closely followed to prevent no more than 13,000 gallons of 152A from being present in an 18000 gallon capacity, non-pressurized outside above-ground storage\ntank.  The tank is located in a fenced, secured area, an estimated 80' from the north wall of the facility and is video monitored 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  It is also physically inspected on a daily basis by maintenance and security professionals and weekly by production and regulatory/safety professionals.  Any deficiencies \nare documented and followed up with immediate remedial action.  Strict Good Manufacturing Processes and state of the art active/passive detection, prevention and fire/explosion repression systems are utilized to minimize the possibility of any loss scenarios.  SLG is in complete compliance with local, state and federal \nregulations.  It is the philosophy of SLG to go beyond minimum requirements to approach compliance in a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to aid in the prevention, detection and control of loss potentials.  SLG is recognized as a Star worksite under OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, which is the highest level of recognition.  They have participated in the VPP since 2003.
