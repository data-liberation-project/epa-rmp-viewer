Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with this material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency\nplanning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to farmers for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 lbs. in the\nfacilitys 30,000 gal tank.  \n\n3. The worst case scenario would be a release of the total contents of the 30,000 gal storage tank over a ten minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 lb which represents 85% of the total capacity of the tank as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on the model used is 1.59 mile.\n\n    The alternative-case release scenario anhydrous ammonia is assumed  to be a release from a rupture of a 1 1/2 inch  transfer hose with 7127 lbs released over a 2 minute period.  The distance to the end point of dispersion is .48 mile.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois  Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 AND OSHA 29 CFR  191  0.1 11 regarding storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or"

The Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with  OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38 and provide state and local authorities the emergencyplanning and right to know information as required under SARA TITLE III of  EPCRA.  Our  emergency response action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergecy planning committee for the coordination in the community response planning. \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess  the maintenance of safe practices and operaions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
