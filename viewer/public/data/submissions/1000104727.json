Once the active release area was clear of ammonia, facility personnel completed soil abatement, replenished soil and land applied contaminated soil.  After bleeding off remaining NH3 in nurse tank, the leaking valve was inspected, and although no visible issues were found, the valve was not closing consistently and was replaced. No injuries occurred.  Due to the suspicious nature of the release, a report of potential theft was filed with the Linn County Sheriff deputy on site.  It was later discovered, after reviewing security camera video, that the leak was not a result of theft. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of the company to immediately notify the responding fire department, and the appropriate LEPC/EMA to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the responding fire department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at the location, the fire department with whom the responding fire department has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  This policy has been reviewed with the fire department and LEPC/EMA. \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of an"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 with amendments and State law.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.

The employee donned PPE and attempted to close the leaking valve when flow from the valve suddenly increased.  Employee quickly moved away from the nurse tank and contacted 911.  Other arriving employees moved to south end of facility as NH3 vapor was visible and flowing NNW.  NRC (1276562) and Iowa DNR (050320-MTC-0538) were contacted. Upon arrival of Central City FD, incident commander requested support from Coggon and Prairieburg FDs and Linn Co. HazMat.  North and south facility entrances were blocked by Fire Depts and Linn County Sheriff deputy.  Although nearby residences (4) were not in danger, responders requested residents to shelter-in-place affecting six (6) adults and three (3) children.  HazMat arrived and after donning level A suits, attempted to close leaking nurse tank valve with no success.  HazMat team met with other team me"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the local fire department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the fire department notification, the appropriate LEPC/EMA will be contacted.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned.  In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or Acts of God which might occur on our premises.
