The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and  employees of the Progressive Ag Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  if an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  Our employees are trained on a three year, rotating basis.  These meetings are put on annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture and KARA.  Employees are trained on chemical properties, safe handling, and safe maintenance procedures.  \n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storing of grain and fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as part of crop production.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 131,070 pounds in our tank with the capacity of 30,000 gallons.  There are a number of 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for lease to farmers.  The maximum amount handled at one time would be a semi trailer on site to unload.  They typically hold 41,000#.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario and Alternate Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case release scenarios have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is a security issue and is dictated by the homeland security act.  \n\n\n\n4.  The accidental Release Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.6\", published by the American Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". \n\n\n\n5.
