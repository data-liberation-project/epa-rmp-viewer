      "SummaryText": "The City of Carthage has recently completed the conversion of the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) disinfection system from ultraviolet to chlorination/dechlorination.  The construction phase has been declared substantially complete and the chlorination system is currently in service.  As part of the chlorination system implementation, the City of Carthage has completed this Risk Management Plan (RPM) in accordance with the USEPA guidelines.  The WWTP has been using chlorination disinfection since 10/2004 without any release of chlorine gas.  The City has incorporated operator training, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures in the development and implementation of the system and those items have been incorporated into this RMP.  The RMP includes inspection forms, reporting forms, as well as MSDS information, emergency contact information, first aid information, and an emergency response plan to make certain that all plant personnel have access to the information needed to deal with an accidental release."
