Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nKroger Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the GLRDC.\n\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Gary Streepy, Regulatory Compliance, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as n"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center follows these corporate safety guidelines. \n\n\n\n     Employee Orientation and Plant Safety Rules\n\n     Kroger Contractor Safety Rules\n\n     Kroger Safety Inspection and Abatement Plans\n\n     \n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc.  The facility is a distribution center that distributes dry grocery, perishable, and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to Kroger retail foodstores.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 37,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility involves the release of 17,500 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions that were used for this scenario a"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief devices;\n\nThe system is operated at considerably lower pressures compared to the PSV's relief pressure setting;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\nThe facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the pressure relief devices; \n\nThe f"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards. Any recommendations are resolved to improve facility safety. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps that should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties that they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has be"

Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.  Any recommendations from audits are resolved to improve the RM program. \n\n \n\nE.   Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center has had one release of Anhydrous Ammonia in the last five years. The amount released was approx. 25 pounds. There were no off site injuries. Local Fire officials were notified. Approximately 120 employees were sheltered in place as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n\nF.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Delaware City Fire Department.  The facility has cooperated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to develop a response plan that can be used in the event of an ammonia release that may have off site impact.\n\n\n\nThe e"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAs new employees are hired, training continues to be modified to better address the skill sets that mechanics bring with them. Our most recent annual Emergency Response Refresher Training was held at our facility for the first time and included members of the Delaware City Fire Department and HAZMAT Team. We will include Delaware CEMA this year to establish a solid Response Team."
