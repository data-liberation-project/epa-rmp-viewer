Inc., is a independent fertilizer and agricultural chemical retailer located north of the city limits of Greene IA.  We manufacture   suspension  fertilizers  for sell as nutrient imputs for production of agricutural crops.  Our  manufacturing process involves the use of anhydrous ammonia, monomonium phosphate, potasium, liquid nitrogen, and antapolgite gelling clay to create prescription fertilizer blends tailored to each customers needs, as determined by soil testing.  We also offer certified custom application of these fertilizer  blends, seperately or in conjuction with application of various agricutural pesticides, tailored also to each customers needs and determined by our agronomy  department, customer imputs, and field scouting.   Greene Farm Equipment &  Agricultural Co. DBA Greene Ag Services, Inc., is governed by the laws set forth by the Iowa  Department of Agriculture, Iowa Department  of  Natural Resources (IDNR), Eviromental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which includes testing and continuing  education administered  by the state through area extension offices.  We also  adhere to guidelines established by the Agricultural Retailers Association (ARA) and related organizations of which we are members. The chemical that we are fileling our RMP for is anhydrous ammonia  and is also the chemical we are using in our worst case scenarios.     Our worst case scenario for release of anhydrous ammonia would be (1)  The catatrophic rupture of both our  anhydrous ammonia storage vessels.  This would cause an immediate release of all product stored within these vessels, which depending on the time of year, could range from 0 to 100000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.  Though highly unlikely, due to initial construction and yearly maintenance of these storage vessels.  If such a scenario should occur we would work closely with the "

DBA Greene Ag Services, Inc.  A plan for evacuation of the business and  residential areas of Greene, as well as our on site employees,  is set forth in Contingency Plan filed with the Fire Dept. and local law enforcement officals.  Said plan would initiate immediately contingent upon wind speed and direction, atmospheric conditions, volumes of anhydrous ammonia released and recommendations of forementioned officals.     Worst case scenario (2) would be the unexpected  release of anhydrous ammonia  into the atmosphere through a rupture in hose and/or piping leading from the storage vessels.  This is unlikely, but more probable due to the construction of the hoses and/or piping.  The loss of anhydrous ammonia would be minimul  due to the safety system built into our anhydrous ammonia storage vessels such as a excess flow valves installed in the outlets of each of our storage vessels and over pressure relief vavles installed in the plumbing and storage vessels.  Greene Farm Equipment & Agricutural Co. DBA Greene Ag Services, Inc. is equipped to handle a release of a small amount of anhydrous ammonia as result of our employee training and on site safety equipment.  A release of this nature is not likely to cause harm to employees or nearby residents.  Water curtains and self contained breathing apparatus supplied by the Fire Dept. would be utilized if necessary to rectify the situation.  However if local officials determined an evacuation of employees and nearby residents was warranted, our contigency plan, on file with Greene Fire Dept. and local law enforcement officials, would be implemented.
