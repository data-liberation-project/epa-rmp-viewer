Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Solvay USA, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur Winder, Georgia facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  These products are used in the manufacture a variety of consumer goods, including personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, detergents, and textile processing aids. We also make polyester based polymers which are used for soil release in detergent applications and in textile processing. We presently have 3 substances at our facility, which are regulated under the EPA RMP regulations. These are Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methylamine [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-].\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for production of Episulfonate Solution - an intermediate used to produce surfactants for Industrial and Personal Care Products. Methylamine [Methanamine] is used for Methyl Taurine - a surfactant for commercial cleaning applications. Dimethylamine [Methanamine, Nmethyl-] is used for production of ASC Intermediate, which is used to produce an end product used in various Industrial and Personal Care Products.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 200,000 lb.\n\nMethylamine [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-] are present on-site at our\n\nfacility in maximum quantitie"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition, and other nationally recognized safe design standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nSolvay USA, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\n\nidentified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes What If, HAZOP, and Layers of Protection Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations plus experienced operations personnel. The safety studies are revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA update for Methyl Taurine and use of MonoMethylAmine was performed on 1/9/2018. The most recent PHA update for ASC Intermediate and the use of Dimethylamine was performed on 8/10/2017. The most recent PHA update for Episulfonate Solution and use of Epichlorohydrin, was held on 5/11/2017.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWe maintain written Equipment Operating Procedures addressing safety and quality specific to the operating equipment and system. In addition we have written Manufacturing Procedures for each of our products.  These procedures are controlled to en"

Refresher training is provided periodically. Training on handling, use, and hazards of raw materials and products is conducted regularly.\n\nMechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program\n\n\n\nWe have a formal documented Mechanical Integrity / Preventive Maintenance Program. Regularly scheduled maintenance checks on process equipment ensure proper operation. Process equipment covered by the system includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls, and pumps. Qualified contractors complete some periodic inspections and tests, other inspections and tests are carried out by our own qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Plant personnel are provided specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by inspections and tests are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at our facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology,\n\nequipment and procedures.
