Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator is evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\r\n\r\nF. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nVeeco will only respond to incidental releases of anhydrous ammonia where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases Veeco will rely on outside responders. Therefore, Veeco has coordinated response actions with the local fire department and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\r\n\r\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on operational knowledge from other facilities, Veeco believes that the existing safety program is adequate. However, if any changes occur in the future which affect the anhydrous ammonia process, these changes will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the safety of Veeco employees and neighbors is not compromised."
