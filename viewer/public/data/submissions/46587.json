This facility not only has had no accidents in the past five (5) years, but has had no releases at all in it's total history of over twenty (20) years.  This history is a direct result of continuous training, proper installation procedures and safe handling of products.  This site was most recently upgraded and evaluated in August, 1998.  Emergency response procedures are taught and a copy of the written instructions are on site;  employees are taught to handle minor occurrences and to contact 911 for situations requiring the local emergency response program.  Continued training and improved technology are constants in this on-going program."

      "SummaryText": "The City of Bridge City provides sanitary sewer treatment at this facility.  This treatment process involves the introduction of chlorine gas into the system; this chlorine is contained in two-thousand (2,000) pound cylinders and is liquified under pressure.  No more than four (4) such cylinders are on site at any one time and they are never all full at the same time.  These cylinders are housed in a sheltered and guard-rail protected area and no more than two (2) cylinders are connected at any given time.                                                                           Plant operators are on duty and on site at all times that the chlorine process is functioning.  Operators are given regularly scheduled training and provided with the latest information regarding safe practices, prevention and response.  Portable air packs are provided at the site at all times in the event of release and operators are taught to use them properly.  If a leak is detected,the operator is taught to don the self-contained air pack, manually close the cylinder valve and then call 911 if the leak is not contained.  Any release is then reported to the immediate supervisor and the chemical distributor.                                                                                     The worst-case release scenario applied in this report was a model taken from the RMPComp program.  This scenario would only occur in an instance where a cylinder ruptured during non-operating hours when no one was present.  In this type of incident, notification would be to 911, the local police authorities and/or the fire department; the local emergency response program would take over responsibility at that time, including the evacuation of surrounding residential and school areas in the .9 mile end-point area.  The alternative release scenario used was for a hose release based on model information from RMPComp.  In this case, the plant operator would detect the leak, don the self-contained air"
