This process generates alkylate, a high octane blending component for gasoline.  The Alkylation Unit uses Sulfuric Acid as a catalyst.  The MTBE plant produces MTBE from an olefin and Methanol; MTBE is used as an oxygenate in fuel.  \r\n\r\nThe cracking processes produce very small hydrocarbons as well as the larger fractions discussed above.  The Gas Plants and the Light Hydrocarbon Processor (LHP) purify these compounds.  The smallest molecules (one and two carbons) are used in the refinery for fuel.  The propanes and butanes are used as feedstocks for the Alkylation process and for commercial sale.  \r\n\r\nThe refinery has several boilers that produce high pressure, high temperature steam, which is used for both heating and cooling various processes.  The Water Treatment Plants (WTP) produce high quality water for use in the boilers and process cooling systems.  The API Separator and the Waste Water Treatment (WWT) plant are part of the refinery's waste water treatment system.  The water that is removed from crude oil prior to processing and water from other process stages is treated by separation and biological conversion systems prior to its permitted discharge.  \r\n\r\nThe sulfur and nitrogen removed from processing streams is converted into anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur at the Chemical Plant.  The Chemical Plant actually consists of five units, the Ammonia Recovery Unit (ARU), Acid Plant, Diethanolamine (DEA) Stripping Unit, Sulfur Recovery Unit (SRU) and a Shell Claus Offgas Treating (SCOT) Unit.  The ARU removes Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide from refinery sour water streams.  The Ammonia is then purified for agricultural purposes, while the Hydrogen Sulfide is sent to the SRU.  The Acid Plant recycles the spent Sulfuric Acid from the Alkylation Unit for its reuse.  The DEA stripping u"

To use RMPComp to calculate the WCS endpoint, any of the following flammable substances, Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, or Pentane, can be used to model a flammable mixture.  Since their heats of combustion are relatively close, they all provide the same distance to the endpoint.  As required, no passive mitigation measures are considered. \r\n\r\nProgram Level 3 Processes, Worst Case Scenarios:\r\n\r\nThe refinery has 5 Covered Processes classified as Program Level 3 processes.  Two WCS are required to be reported for Program Level 3 processes, one flammable and one toxic.  The largest WCS was selected according to regulatory requirements for the flammable and toxic scenarios.  The toxic WCS for the refinery involves anhydrous Ammonia.  The scenario is a complete failure of the storage tank releasing its entire contents of Ammonia.  The scenario was modeled using RMP Comp.  The concentration of Ammonia at the endpoint is 200 parts per million, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline-2 (ERPG-2) level for this compound.  The flammable WCS for the Refinery involves Butane.  The scenario is a complete failure of a Butane storage tank.  The WCS endpoint used for an explosion is 1 psi overpressure.  RMP Comp was used to perform the calculations. As required, no passive mitigation measures were included in either set of calculations.\r\n\r\nProgram Level 3 Processes, Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP regulation requires the calculation of Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS).  Unlike the WCS, the ARS calculations allow consideration of active safety measures in addition to passive safety measures.  One ARS is determined for each regulated substance at the refinery.  There is an ARS for flammables, anhydrous Ammonia, and Oleum (Sulfur Trioxide).  Each of the scenarios was developed based upon a review of PHA reports, review of previous incidents, review of process operating condition and process equipment installation.\r\n\r\nThe ARS"

Personnel use PSI during a process hazard analysis (PHA), writing operating procedures, training operators, planning maintenance jobs and in engineering project design.  PSI that was used in the PHA is retained with the PHA documentation, which is kept for the life of the process.  \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information has three categories of information:  chemical hazards, process technology and process equipment.  The PSI program addresses the written requirements for chemical hazards by using Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  The MSDSs contain the required information regarding chemical toxicity, Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL), physical data, corrosivity data, thermal and chemical stability data, reactivity data and the hazardous effects of incompatible mixtures.  In addition to the MSDSs, the refinery has Hazardous Material Warning Sheets (HMWS) prepared for each vessel in the refinery.  The HMWS is a one-page summary of the potental chemical hazards from the materials contained within the vessel.  The HMWS highlights the NFPA ratings, warning statements, immediate hazards, first aid treatment, symptoms of exposure and proper Personal Protective Equipment required.  In addition, the HMWS references the full MSDS.  \r\n\r\nThe chemical hazard data was originally compiled by the Industrial Hygienist (IH), who compiled the appropriate MSDSs and entered them into a database.  The IH is responsible for managing the currency and accuracy of the MSDSs.  New chemicals are added to the system through a review process where several departments review the MSDS prior to its addition to the database and prior to the chemical's addition to the process area.  MSDSs are available to employees through the refinery intranet and from the IH.

The principal fuels produced are gasoline and diesel.  The refinery produces propane and butane for commercial purposes.  In addition, the refinery produces anhydrous Ammonia and elemental Sulfur for the agricultural market, as well as petroleum coke used for fuel in cogeneration plants.  The refinery accomplishes the production of these products from crude oil through the use of many complex processing units.  The refinery principally processes San Joaquin Valley Crudes and Alaskan North Slope Crude.  Oil must be converted to lighter hydrocarbons in order for it to be useable as motor fuels.  In addition, the sulfur and nitrogen must be removed from the oil distillates during processing to produce motor fuels that produce less smog upon combustion by cars and trucks.  \r\n\r\nCrude oil begins its journey through the refinery at the Crude Units.  Desalters dehydrate the oil and electrically remove salts to reduce the corrosivity.  It is then sent to the distillation tower where the hydrocarbons are heated and separated into fractions by molecular weight.  Lighter hydrocarbons have lower boiling points than heavier hydrocarbons.  The distillation tower produces six fractions:  wet gas/butanes, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, gas oil and resid.  The heaviest component, resid, is sent to the Feed Prep units for further distillation under vacuum.  After vacuum distillation, the Feed Prep bottom product, which is made up of very heavy hydrocarbons and is a solid at ambient temperature, is sent to the Coker.  The Coker thermally cracks large molecules into smaller ones.  These smaller molecules can then be further processed into motor fuels.  The Coker also produces petroleu"

These fractions are catalytically cracked in the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and/or the Hydrocracker Unit.  Both of these units crack the hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules in the presence of a catalyst.  Catalytic cracking is more selective than thermal cracking.  The FCCU cracking breaks long chain hydrocarbons into short chains and multi-ring compounds into smaller ring compounds.  In addition, olefin compounds (unsaturated hydrocarbons) are generated.  Olefins are undesirable in motor fuels because they contribute to the formation of smog during engine combustion.  The olefins are removed by other process units.  The cracking process in the Hydrocracker occurs in the presence of Hydrogen gas.  Any olefins and other unsaturated compounds are saturated during the hydrocracking process in addition to breaking larger chain or ringed hydrocarbons into smaller compounds.  \r\n\r\nThe Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) units remove sulfur and nitrogen from their feedstocks, creating Hydrogen Sulfide and Ammonia, which are separated and processed elsewhere.  These units also saturate olefins.  The HDS units are particularly important for ensuring cleaner burning gasoline, since the removal of these compounds is critical to preventing smog from engine combustion of gasoline and diesel.  The Hydrodearomatization (HDA) unit removes aromatic compounds from diesel fractions, a necessary step in production of cleaner burning fuels.  The Butadiene plant saturates the Butadiene (another olefin) generated by the Coker.  The Reformer Units rearrange hydrocarbons from straight chains into branched chains, rings and aromatics; these are desirable compounds because they raise the octane number of the motor fuels.

These materials range in flammability from Pentane (with a flash point greater than -40( F) to Hydrogen (with a flash point of -100( F).  Larger flash points indicate less flammability.  Materials with low flash points must be handled carefully and isolated from ignition sources to prevent fires or explosions involving these compounds.

Oleum has potential to liberate Sulfur Trioxide, which is a toxic gas with a sharp penetrating odor.  Oleum is a product of the Sulfuric Acid recycling process.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe refinery has both Program Level 1 and Program Level 3 Covered Processes as defined by EPA's RMP regulation.  A Program Level 1 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the Worst Case Scenario (WCS) does not go offsite.  A Program Level 3 process is a process that contains at least the threshold quantity of a regulated substance and the WCS reaches an offsite receptor.  A Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is a hypothetical event and the parameters for calculating the WCS is defined in the regulations.

Employee feedback forms are available for providing feedback on Process Safety Information and other Risk Management elements.  \r\n\r\nSome examples of active employee participation are listed in this section; however, this is not a list of all of the activities that fall under Employee Participation.  Employees regularly participate in two types of Safety Audits; one focuses on facilities, equipment and work practices (the Planned General Inspection), the other focuses on behavior and actions (the Layered Safety Survey).  Both hourly and salaried employees participate on PHA teams.  Operators review and provide input on the adequacy of Operating Procedures.  The current maintenance craft training program was developed by a team of union represented maintenance mechanics and supervisors.  Incident Investigations of more serious incidents are conducted by teams of employees.  Employees participate in Compliance Audits through interviews by audit team members.  Operators are responsible for controlling access of contractors to their process area.  Operators permit all hot work and other safe work practices in their process area.

Operating Procedures are organized into Operating Manuals for each process unit.  Every Operating Manual contains all the process information, engineering data, and reference sources that is required to operate the unit in a safe, efficient, reliable and environmentally sound manner.  The Operating Procedures program is beneficial to preventing accidental releases because the operating procedures are used as a basis for operating units safely and reliably.\r\n\r\nThe written Operating Manuals were developed from a standard template.  All Operating Manuals follow a consistent format that is divided into six sections.  There is an introduction section, a process safety and environmental section, an equipment description section, a process control variable section, a troubleshooting section and a failure prevention section.  In addition, each manual contains information so that the Operator can take appropriate action to safely perform any of the following:  an initial unit start-up, normal operation of the unit, shutdown of the unit during an emergency, operation of the unit during an emergency, a normal shutdown of the unit, a startup after a turn around and a startup after an emergency shutdown.  The Operating Procedures also contain information regarding the consequences of deviating from normal operating parameters and the steps to correct deviations and avoid deviations.

Preventative maintenance is performance of equipment inspection and repair based on time and historical knowledge of the equipment.  Predictive maintenance involves utilizing technological methods of inspection to determine equipment condition.  Preventative and predictive maintenance used in combination determine the inspection and repair frequency of equipment at the refinery.  Routine maintenance is the repair of equipment as dictated by predictive maintenance, preventative maintenance and equipment condition.  A turnaround is maintenance of a process unit on a large scale.  A turnaround is the periodic shutdown of a processing unit for cleaning, internal inspection and renewal.

Redlined copies of P&IDs are placed in the control room prior to start-up.  All operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures changes must be addressed prior to unit start-up.  Employee training on the change typically takes place at safety meetings or one-on-one meetings with the supervisor.  In addition, control rooms have MOC binders for operators to read as part of the shift change routine.  If changes involve procedures, supervisors are responsible for ensuring that their employees are trained and understand the new procedure.  This may involve one-on-one discussions or practical demonstration.  PSSR records are retained with MOC records.  Any recommendations from the PSSR are tracked through a database.  The Operations Supervisor verifies the completeness of the PSSR and authorizes the start-up.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Compliance Audit Program is to determine the status and effectiveness of the Risk Management Programs established to meet the regulatory requirements of the Process Safety and Risk Management Regulations.  The Compliance Audit program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because the objective of the program is to assess existing Risk Management Programs and to find ways to improve the programs.  \r\n\r\nThree Compliance Audits have been conducted since the implementation of OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard.  The audits were conducted in 1995, 1997 and 2000 respectively.  Each audit lasted approximately two to four weeks and reviewed all of the Risk Management Programs.  The Compliance Audit methodology utilized was the Federal OSHA's Program Quality Verification (PQV).

The findings and their corrective actions are tracked in databases maintained by the Health and Safety department.  (This database system also tracks findings from other types of audits, incident investigations and PHAs.)  Minimally, the last two compliance audits are retained in the filing system.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe refinery has an Incident Investigation program that establishes uniform procedures for reporting and investigating incidents and near misses.  The program focuses on determining the facts surrounding the incident and formulating corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from recurring.  The Incident Investigation program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because corrective actions are generated during investigations to prevent the incident from occurring again.\r\n\r\nThe Incident Investigation program classifies incidents into three categories, minor, serious and major.  Minor level incidents are investigated by an Area Supervisor using a causal factor approach to determine the cause of the incident.  Serious and major incidents are investigated by multi-disciplinary teams using Root Cause Analysis (RCA) methodology.  \r\n\r\nAll employees have some level of responsibility for the Incident Investigation program.

Each event is promptly categorized to ensure the correct level of investigation is initiated in a timely manner.  All incident investigations must be commenced within 48 hours of the incident.  An investigation form is then completed that includes the following information:  a classification of the incident or near miss, date and time of incident, date and time investigation began, CWS level, incident checklist (e.g. type of injury or release), the location of the incident, facts about the incident, information about involved personnel, any immediate actions taken to mitigate hazards, list of corrective actions, and a witness interview form.  For minor investigations, a causal factor checklist is completed to assist in the development of proper corrective actions.  \r\n\r\nSerious and major level incidents are investigated using RCA methodology.  RCA is an in-depth investigation method that determines the underlying causes of an incident.  The investigation involves gathering data by performing site inspections, conducting interviews of involved personnel and emergency responders and reviewing relevant documentation, such as regulations, standards, engineering data and refinery procedures.  This data is then analyzed by converting data to statements of fact vs. supposition, bridging gaps in the data and determining the root causes by using the root cause flow chart.  The root cause flow chart assists in identifying which management systems were causal factors.  The final report from a RCA includes the same incident investigation form as described above as well as a more comprehensive report about the findings from the incident.

The purpose of the Hot Work program is to develop and implement consistent hot work practices and precautions to control tasks that may create sources of ignition.  The program also provides consistent planning and authorization of those tasks.  The Hot Work program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it provides a consistent methodology to address prevention of fires that could potentially result from ignition producing work.  \r\n\r\nThe Hot Work Permitting Program applies to all equipment or tasks capable of generating energy sufficient to ignite flammable/combustible materials, vapors or gasses.  The equipment and tasks are divided into two categories, high energy and low energy. Some of the activities qualifying as low energy include the use of battery operated tools, grinding, chipping concrete and flash photography.  Some of the high energy tasks are gas or electric welding, pre or post weld heat treating, and abrasive blasting on storage tanks.  Whenever possible, employees and contractors are to move the job requiring Hot Work to the shop or weld bay to avoid performing this work in the process area.\r\n\r\nPrior to each Hot Work job, a permit must be completed.  The permit requires the following information to be filled out:  the date and time of job start, equipment identification, the type of work to be performed, classification of the hot work as low or high energy, a checklist for site preparation, a checklist for any PPE requirements, a checklist for emergency provisions, and atmospheric testing results.

Other types of atmospheric tests may also be required depending upon the nature of the work and process area.  High energy Hot Work also requires the completion of a pre-plan by an Operations Supervisor and Maintenance Supervisor prior to completing the Hot Work permit.  Authorizing signatures for a low energy Hot Work permit include the responsible operator, the head operator, the craftsperson and a fire watch.  For a high energy permit, the responsible operator, the head operator, the craftsperson, the fire watch and the shift supervisor authorize the permit.  These signatures mean that the permit has been reviewed, the proper tests have been performed and that the job site is safe to allow work to proceed.  If additional personnel are required for the job, each of them must also review and sign the permit.  Upon completion of the job, the responsible operator and the craftsperson review the site to ensure that it has been left clean and in a safe condition.  Once the Hot Work is complete, copies of the permits are retained for two years.\r\n\r\nHot Work permits are good from the start time listed on the permit until 7 AM.  All permits terminate at 7 AM every morning.  A new permit must be issued if more hot work is needed.  At evening shift change, the permit is suspended until the operator coming on shift has reviewed the permit, reviewed the work site, conducted atmospheric testing and documented their findings on the permit.  If conditions, precautions, work scope, or work procedures change, the Hot Work permit is terminated and a new permit must be issued.  One of the ways to monitor the conditions is with the atmospheric testing required in the Hot Work permit.

A HAZOP is a detailed review of the process in a systematic fashion to determine whether process deviations can lead to undesirable consequences.  Detailed PSI is required to perform a HAZOP, since the review process proceeds line-by-line through the processing unit.  The team lists potential causes and consequences of deviation as well as existing safeguards protecting against the deviation.  When the team finds that an inadequate protection exists for a credible deviation, then recommendations are developed to enhance safeguards.  The What-If methodology is a brainstorming approach about possible undesired events.  It is not as structured as the HAZOP, but allows for process safety concerns to be brought forward in a less rigid approach.  The Checklist methodology consists of a written list of items or procedural steps to verify the status of a system.  Development of generic hazard checklists allows this method to be used in combination with other PHA methods.  The use of these three methodologies together increases the probability of discovering hazards.  \r\n\r\nEach PHA performed systematically examines potential deviations and their consequences.  Examples of some of the deviations examined include:  no flow, less flow, more flow, reverse flow, wrong concentrations, contamination of flow, misdirected flow, low temperature, high temperature, low pressure, high pressure, low levels, high levels, start-up and shutdown, leaks/rupture, mechanical seal damage, exchanger tube leaks, corrosion/erosion, mixing concerns, human factors and instrumentation.
