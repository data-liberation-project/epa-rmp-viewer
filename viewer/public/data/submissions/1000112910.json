The facility stores and distributes petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel.  In addition to petroleum storage, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline as well as receives propane via pipeline connection that is subsequently transferred via pipeline to a neighboring 3rd party facility.  Both butane and propane require compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations since the onsite storage is greater than 10,000 lbs for each substance.\n\nThe equipment which handles butane includes three pressure vessels and associated piping.   The equipment which handles propane includes a pipeline with associated valving.  Additionally, there is a pressure vessel storing propane.  This propane is used for on-site fuel and operability improvements.  Finally, there is a de-commissioned storage cavern which contains aprroximately 33,000 pounds of stranded propane vapor under nitrogen.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe Carthage Facility has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations, and maintenance procedures.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the company's policy to notify the Jasper County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe regulated butane and propane processes in the facility are compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based"

There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges.  Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThe Carthage Facility has not had an accidental release from either the butane or the propane process during the last 5 years.   \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facility is considered to be a non-responding facility.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years neither the butane storage and blending process nor the propane system has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  \n\nIn the event of future fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane or propane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nAs stated in the 5 year RMP submittal in 2023, the Carthage terminal planned to reduce the propane  inventory by idling the cavern.  This project has been completed.   As a result of this project, the quantity of propane on-site has been reduced from  over 22 million pounds to no more than 180,000 pounds.  This RMP submittal is to document the revised worst case and alternative case scenarios based on the completion of this project.  \n\nAn additiona"
