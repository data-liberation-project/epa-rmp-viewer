      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMotley Chemical Company (also MCC) stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  MCC has Emergency Response Procedures in the office which include procedures for reporting hazardous chemical accidents or releases and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  MCC also has Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures which are a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as Emergency Escape Mask Procedures, which detail how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of a toxic release.   \n\nMCC's Emergency Action Plan is contained in section N of the PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles/glasses, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A verbal notification system is in place to alert personnel about chlorine leaks.  A posted Emergency Telephone List identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMCC provides chlorination service to swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facilit"

The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools.  The facility typically operates five days a week (M-F), and approximately eight hours per day, 50 weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers, is not exposed to vehicular traffic and is locked after normal working hours.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a restricted area.  The Fill area is kept lit at night.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\n\nThe amount of chlorine stored on site is seasonally dependent.  The summer months are the busiest swim times of the year and the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. MCC stores a maximum of 12,000 pounds of chlorine, which exceeds the 2,500 Federal threshold.  This amount includes the contents of 4 one-ton containers, 101 max twenty-pound cylinders, and the (1) one-ton container in the repackaging process. \n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by commercial chlorine suppliers.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The one-ton containers, up to a maximum of 5, are stored and/or used in the Fill Yard.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a crane, hoist or a lift gate.  The one-ton containers are placed on the rails in the Fill Yard.  The one-ton containers are manually rolled to the desired location and chocked to prevent movement.

The entire system is evacuated and the one-ton container liquid valve is shut during non-working hours.  The following emergency equipment is available at the fill yard:  an emergency drench shower/eyewash unit; escape masks; safety goggles/glasses; safety gloves; ammonia to detect leaks; fire extinguisher; first aid kit; valve protectors on the stored  ton containers; valve protectors and caps on the smaller service cylinders.\n\n3.  EPA removed the requirement to include an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the Executive Summary. \n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program. \n\nMCC has a maintenance program for fill yard equipment, including routine preventative maintenance and equipment inspections.  The specific safe work processes in place at MCC's facility are detailed in the PSM.  \n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nMCC's Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) was recently updated and revalidated, and checked for accuracy and completeness.  The PHA is consistent with current processes.

The company has administrative procedures in place that limit the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than a maximum total of 12,020 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 12,020 pounds.\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed by a vacuum system into a liquid caustic absorption tank.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.    \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT aproved containers, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption/vacuum system.\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to the lower (liquid level) valve on the operating one-ton container and an empty service cylinder is brought into place on a scale and attached to the other end of the transfer assembly.  The packaging system is operated under pressure from the ton containers.  Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the scale reaching the desired value, the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine vacuum system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging"
