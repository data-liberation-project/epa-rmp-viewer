All employees who handle anhydrous ammonia are required to\n\nattend bi-annual training which emphas the properties of anhydrous ammonia, the affects of anhydrous\n\nammonia on the human body, operating procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency first aid. PPE,\n\nincluding gloves, goggles, hard hats, emergency water, and sturdy work cloths & shoes are required\n\nwhenever handling anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, this facility is prepared to\n\nwork with local fire departments, LEPCAA?s, law enforcement, or other authorities to mitigate the impact of\n\nthe release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmer customers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and kept in (a) storage tank(s) until distributed to customers in\n\nmobile nurse tanks for use as a nitrogen fertilizer. The storage tank(s), several anhydrous ammonia nurse\n\ntanks, risers for filling the nurse tanks, pumps and controls, lighting and safety equipment are all part of the\n\nfacilities anhydrous ammonia operation. The facility is staffed during seasonal operating hours, and is\n\nsecured when not in operation. Security includes area lighting, closing and locking the main valve (belly\n\nvalve) from the storage tank(s), locking out power to pumps, closing fill hose end valves and locking them in a\n\nbox that prevents unauthorized access to them, locking nurse tank unloading valves, and walk-thru\n\ninspections.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of AA?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, K-61-1AA? p"

Annual inspections by Iowa Department of Agriculture\n\nand Land Stewardship (IDALS) are made on facilities and portable nurse tanks. Frequent site inspections are\n\nmade by management and safety consultants. Equipment inspections, maintenance and employee training\n\nare conducted prior to every application season.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that caused any death,\n\ninjuries, or significant damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,\n\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. Even though this site has had\n\nno releases, it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the systems and\n\nprocedures for response to a leak.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nThis facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38. The\n\nfacility has also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know\n\ninformation as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA), and has coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the\n\nmaintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety\n\nrecommendations for implantation at this time."
