The RMP covers the following facilities which are under common\r\ncontrol by SNF Holding Company (SNF):  Chemtall Incorporated, Bioflocryl, and NCF \r\nManufacturing, Inc.  The location of the facility is 31o 44'36.6 N, 81o 26'9.6W.\r\n\r\nAs part of complying with the Risk Management Program Rule, SNF has reviewed and enhanced\r\npreviously existing accidental release procedures and emergency response policies.  These\r\npolicies include:\r\n                    Emergency Response Program\r\n                    Emergency Action Plan\r\n                    Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan\r\n                    Process Safety Management Plan\r\n                    Hurricane and Tropical Storm Plan\r\n                    First Responder Team\r\n                    Hazard Communication Plan\r\n                    Hazardous Waste Management Plan\r\n                    StormWater Pollution Prevention Plan\r\n                    Safe Work Practices\r\n                    Hazmat/Hazwoper Team\r\n\r\nThere are five substances at the SNF facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident\r\nPrevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68.  These substances are used in various processes\r\nthroughout the facility to produce water treatment polymers.  These substances and the specific\r\nprocesses covered include:\r\n\r\n     Toxic Substances:\r\n\r\n          Methyl chloride: This material is used in the chloromethylation (CM) plant at Chemtall. \r\n     The CM Plant uses methyl chloride as a reactant to produce quaternized monomers that\r\n     are subsequently used in other facility processes to produce water treatment chemicals. \r\n     The CM plant products are also sold to off-site customers.  The maximum quantity of\r\n     methyl chloride stored on-site is 420,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n          Ammonium hydroxide: Ammonium hydroxide is received"

The maximum\r\n     amount of 50 percent formaldehyde stored on-site is 96,000 pounds (48,000 pounds pure\r\n     formaldehyde).\r\n\r\n          Acrylonitrile: Acrylonitrile is used as a reactant in Bioflocryl's acrylamide process. \r\n     The maximum amount of acrylamide stored on-site is 1,100,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n     Flammable Substances:\r\n\r\n          Dimethylamine: Dimethylamine (DMA) is also used in the Mannich process as a\r\n     reactant.

As required, worst-case scenarios\r\nare presented in the RMP for one toxic substance and one flammable substance.  Alternate\r\nscenarios were prepared for each of the toxic substances with worst-case endpoints located\r\noffsite (methyl chloride, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, and ammonium hydroxide) and for one flammable\r\nsubstance to represent all flammable substances.  The endpoint represents the distance at which a\r\nreleased substance must travel before it disperses sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the\r\npublic.  \r\n\r\nFor the worst-case scenario, EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest\r\nquantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure th"

For the worst-case analysis, the possible causes of the\r\nworst-case release or the probability that such a release might occur are not considered.  The\r\nrelease is simply assumed to take place by suddenly releasing the entire contents of the vessel. \r\nThe results of the worst-case scenario analysis were as follows:\r\n\r\n          Toxics: The methyl chloride storage tank was assumed to fail and to instantaneously\r\n     release the entire tank contents.  No passive mitigation controls were considered in\r\n     limiting the release impacts.

For flammable materials, the alternate release scenario assumed that dimethylamine\r\nwas released as a result of the uncoupling or rupture of a hose during unloading operations.  The\r\nresults of the alternate release scenario analysis were as follows: \r\n\r\n          Acrylonitrile: In the alternate scenario, 6,000 pounds of acrylonitrile were assumed to \r\n     be released.
