We are inspected annually by our insurance company as well as the Mo Dept of Agri. for safety precautions and are constantly training and maintaing the equipment. We are a farm retail grain elevator that supplies annhy ammonia to farmer end users in a 7 mile radius.  Our use is seasonal and we have a 12000 gal tank, as our only storage supply. Our worst case is a full tank release in ten minutes, using the RMP Comp as the guide.  The alt case is a common problem that can occur, listed within the RMP Comp that is the most likely to occur during peak rush or busy season.  We have training annually for all employees that handle any anny amonia.  We also have an employee that has had hazard material first responder training.  We have not had any accidents or releases in the past five years.  Heiman Inc works closely with the local vol fire dept to keep them informed and aware of the situation."
