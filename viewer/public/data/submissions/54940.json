This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Black Grape Chillers, 550 Refrigeration, Neutralization and Sulfur Dioxide Systems.  Constellation Wines\u00bf policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n550 REFRIGERATION SYSTEM\nThe Refrigeration system is a Risk Management Program 3 (RMP). This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of four (4) 700 hp screw compressors, high pressure receiver, and one (1) low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation system. There are fourteen (14) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. \n\nNEUTRALIZATION SYSTEM\nThe Neutralization system is a RMP Program 3. Both the Neutralization and Ion Exchange systems utilize the anhydrous ammonia stored in a 11,897 gallon ASME Code Pressure Vessel. The Neutralization system uses anhydrous ammonia to neutralize sulfur dioxide emissions in an evaporative cooling water tower. The evaporative cooling water tower concentrates juice for processing. The cooling tower water is continuously monitored by an in line Ph analyzer. This analyzer signals a control valve that meters an appropriate amount of ammonia into the water to correct the Ph. The Ion Exchange system neutralizes the effect of sulfuric acid in the cation/anion demineralization beds. The cation/anion demineralization system is used to process product in th ewinery.\n\nSULFUR DIOXIDE SYSTEM\nThe Sulfur Dioxide system is a RMP program 3. This process is the simple transfer of liquid anhydrous sulfur dioxide from a one-ton cylinder into smaller gauging cylinders. This process uses gravity assisted by inert gas counterpressure to provide the motive"

This process is a centralized ammonia compression refrigeration system consisting of a screw compressors, high pressure receiver, and a low pressure liquid ammonia recirculation system. There are eight (8) shell & tube heat exchangers used for direct cooling of wine. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for each of the four systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n  \nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for each of the four systems.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and sulfur dioxide has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, Constellation Wines has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a anhydrous ammonia or sulfur dioxide release.  The facility also has safet"

Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\u00a768.65\tProcess Safety Information (PSI) \n\u00a768.67\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u00a768.69 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\u00a768.71\tTraining (TRN)\n\u00a768.73\tMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u00a768.75\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\u00a768.77\tPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\u00a768.79\tCompliance Audits (CA)\n\u00a768.81\tIncident Investigation (II)\n\u00a768.83\tEmployee Participation (EP)\n\u00a768.85\tHot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u00a768.87\tContractors (CO)\n\u00a768.90\tEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of ammonia or sulfur dioxide at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n \nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at Constellation Wines is not encompassed by the federal RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe use of flammable materials at Constellation Wines is not encompassed by the federal RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nConstellation Wines has implemented an Emergency Action Plan and does not assume the role of first responder during an emergency. Constellation Wines has filed a Chemical Inventory Business Plan with the Madera County Fire Department and this plan includes:\n\u00bf\tEmergency Alarm Procedures\n\u00bf\tEvacuation Procedures\n\u00bf\tSafety and Health Considerations\n\u00bf\tNotification Procedures\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nConstellation Wines is extremely diligent in the handling of ammonia and sulfur dioxide. Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the PHA Reports."
