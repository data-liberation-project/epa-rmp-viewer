      "SummaryText": "Mississippi Phosphates Corporartion (MPC) is a manufacturer of fertilizers. A main ingredient in our product is ammonia that is used in the final process of manufacturing diammonium phosphate fertilizers. It is fertilizers such as this that in turn feed and clothe the rest of the world.\n\nAmong the many things that MPC brings to the community is a commitment to operate safely. The company recognizes the health concerns of its neighboring community and is committed to responding to those concerns. A safe workplace is a top priority for company management and personnel, and MPC employees continuously look for innovative ways to operate and maintain the production facillites. MPC participates in routine safety training programs and drills. In addition, continuous monitoring and assessment of the plant facilities ensures that all operations are running smoothly and efficiently.\n\nMPC has a close working relationship with local emergency responders, and together they are prepared to respond to chemical emergencies. To ensure proper emergency preparedness, MPC has a team of employees trained in confined space rescue, hazardous waste operations and other specialities.\n\nMPC transfers ammonia in a pipeline form to its atmospheric storage tank and to its fertilizer plant continuously. A rupture of this pipeline would result in a release of 1,300 pounds of ammonia in an 8-minute period. Under the regulatory defined parameters produces a scenario with a 0.40-mile distance to the endpoint. The distances to the endpoint for the alternate scenarios were also determined by the use of a computer air modeling program called DEGADIS.\n\nMPC uses Chlorine as a water treatment chemical for it's cooling tower located in the sulfuric acid manufacturing unit as well as treatment in the facility potable water system. The facility has four one-ton cylinders located at the water tower. No more than one cylinder is in use at any time. A worst case scenario involving one of the cylinders would rele"

The permit documents that all appropriate fire prevention requirements have been considered and implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations. The permit is kept at the site of the work until completion of the hot work operation.\n\nContractors:\nMPC hires outside contractors to conduct some specialized maintenance and construction projects. All contractors working in the facility, or visitors to the facility, are expected to be aware of and adhere to all MPC health, safety, and environmental policies and procedures. MPC will conduct or require proof of appropriate training. MPC has a set policy for informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nMPC has an extensive emergency response program. Within the facility there is a written Emergency Respons Plan (ERP). The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that asigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, assigns control centers and safe havens, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with ouside assistance. The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, personnel injury or fatality and equipment failures.\n\nThe plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the managememt team t"

The following covers some of these layers of potection:\n\nManaging risks is something MPC does on a daily basis.\n\nWe have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n\nOur employees are highly skilled and well trained.\n\nOur equipment is routinely inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n\nWe have controls in the process throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n\nHazard reviews add another layer of protection. They involve what if scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n\nEmergency response, including employee responders as well as off-site responders, add another layer of protection to the community.\n\nWe work closely with the police and fire departments, and we conduct routine drills.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond.\n\nMPC has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA"

The following summarizes the elements to the release prevention program that are in place at our Pascagoula facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nWorkplace health and safety are of paramount concern. MPC maintains a file and makes its employees aware of processs safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nMPC conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out thes analysis is known as the Hazard and Operabililty (HZAP) study. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, MPC maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining:\nMPC has a training program in place to inform and educate employees and to ensure they are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nMPC carries out documented maintenance checks on covered process equipment during each operational turnaround to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks include among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance opera"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in  process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews:\nPre-startup safety reviews of new processes and to significant modifications in existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at MPC. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nMPC conducts audits on a regular basis to monitor and sustain this process and ensure MPC management is kept informed of all safety, health and environmental matters. Formal audits will be carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\nMPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a castastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nMPC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend imporvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facilitys implementation of the EPA Risk Management Program rule, including information re"
