A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as  protect the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, and the environment.  Arch Chemicals operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable?all of the time.  We recently revitalized this commitment with an ambitious  initiative,  ?The Goal is Zero?.  This initiative is all about striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety, and the environment throughout each product's life cycle.\n\nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA?s RMP rule.\n\n2.0    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n    The Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into 10 distinct units:  Ethylene Oxide, Polysolvs?, Light Hydro Carbons (LHC), Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, Hydrazine blending and packaging, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities and Waste Water Treatment.  Primary products of the facility include ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene glycols, polyether polyols, glycol ethers and microelectronic chemicals.  Note at this time (February 28,2007) that the ethylene oxide and light hydrocarbon facilities are shut down.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the follo"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases, including information about the key administrative controls"

      "SummaryText": " and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nToxics:  Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The selected worst case release scenario assumes the failure of a storage tank containing up to 99,000 pounds of ethylene oxide.  The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes.    Using the EPA OCA tables, rural topography and stipulated meteorology (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F stability class), and passive mitigation measures, the ethylene oxide could travel a significant distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and both the Meade County and Harrison County schools.  There are no EPA listed receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off-site impact.  Although passive mitigation in the form of dikes were considered for this release scenario, the facility also has sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type but were not considered in the consequence analysis. Arch has voluntarily implemented administrative controls to reduce the maximum inventory in the ethylene oxide tanks to less than or equal to 99,000 pounds.\n\nToxics:  Alternate Release Scenario\n\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, a more credible ?alternate? release scenario was considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario because we use the information to develop our detailed emergency response plan.  While a number of scenarios are considered for each of the chemicals covered by the RMP, only one for each toxic chemical is presented.  All scenarios were evaluated using the EPA OCA tables and the stipulated alternate weather conditions of 3.0 m/sec windspeed and D stability class.\n\nFormaldehyde:  The"

The line has isolation valves at each end which will be manually shut by operators required to oversee all material transfers.  Approximately 38 pounds of formaldehyde would be released over a ten-minute period.  The formaldehyde would travel only a  short distance before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.  \n\nEthylenediamine:  An evaluation of credible releases of ethylenediamine (EDA) from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for EDA considers a transfer hose rupture.  Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the reactor, only 12 pounds of EDA (the contents of the hose) would be spilled.  The resulting plume  would remain onsite.\n\nEthylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released to the air in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nPropylene Oxide:  The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 2,270 pounds is released to the air at a height of almost 50 feet in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.

Approximately 833 pounds of liquid acrylonitrile would be spilled, resulting in a plume that could travel a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\n\n\nAmmonia:  The more credible alternate release scenario for ammonia considers the failure of an ammonia process line due to external erosion.  Liquid ammonia is spilled to the gravel surface and 116 pounds is released to the air.  The release lasts for approximately 20 minutes and travels a short distance offsite before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nHydrochloric Acid (37%):  An evaluation of credible releases of 37% HCl from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an off-site impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for 37% HCl considers the puncture of a 55-gallon drum.  Approximately 550 pounds of HCl would spill to the ground.  The resulting plume would stay within the plant site. .      \nHydrazine(64% solution): The more credible release scenario for hydrazine solution considers a transfer hose failure in the transfer of hydrazine from the isotainer to the blend tank. An estimated 600 pounds of solution would be released resulting in a plume traveling a short distance before dispersing enough to not pose a significant hazard to the public.

Administratively limit the maximum allowable inventory for toxic chemicals handled at the facility, including ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, hydrochloric acid and acrylonitrile.\n2.    Conduct extensive in-process and effluent wastewater monitoring in excess of NPDES permit requirements for derivatives of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.\n3.
