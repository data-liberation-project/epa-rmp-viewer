The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The City of Hickory Northeast Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDescription of the City of Hickory Northeast Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe City of Hickory Northeast Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  These substances are:\r\n\r\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the wastewater prior to release into the receiving stream.\r\n* Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used to remove the chlorine from the treated wastewater before release into the receiving stream\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\r\n \r\nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Hickory Northeast Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to the RMP Rule Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The Disinfection Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\r\n\r\n4.1  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe City of Hickory Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\r\n\r\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\r\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\r\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\r\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\r\n* specific chemical inventories.\r\n \r\nThe City of Hickory Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all City of Hickory Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.

The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Disinfection Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the EHS Committee and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Hickory Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Disinfection Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the EHS Committee for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\n4.3  Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nCity of Hickory Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant engineers, operators, and management work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Disinfection Process operation should be safely performed.
