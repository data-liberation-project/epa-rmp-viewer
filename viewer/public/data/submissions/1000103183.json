The refrigeration system at the Joplin, MO facility is a two-stage, closed-loop, mechanical refrigeration system. Liquid ammonia is supplied by pump or pressure to the production and process area evaporators and heat exchangers for cooling and freezing purposes. Ammonia vapor and liquid from the evaporators returns to the suction vessels in the engine room. The normal high-side operating pressure ranges from 130 to 185 psig. The maximum allowable working pressure is 250 to 300 psig. The maximum intended ammonia inventory is 32,024 lbs.\n\nAs part of their PSM program, Ajinomoto Foods North America has completed a process hazard analysis, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on awareness and system operation, established procedures to conduct management of change procedures and pre-startup safety reviews, and developed a mechanical integrity program for ammonia refrigeration equipment. In addition to the daily monitoring of the refrigeration process, Ajinomoto Foods North America implements an ongoing preventive maintenance program to ensure the refrigeration equipment and safety systems are maintained in good operating condition.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the RMP general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Ajinomoto Foods North America to address the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Joplin, MO facility. The PSM program developed and implemented at Ajinomoto Foods North America includes the following steps:\n\u00bf\tWritten plans for implementing employee participation in PSM.\n\u00bf\tProces"
