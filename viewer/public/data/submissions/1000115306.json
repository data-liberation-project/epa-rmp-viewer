This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00bf A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\u00bf A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\u00bf A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\u00bf An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\u00bf An overview of our emergency response program\n\u00bf An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\u00bf The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n\u00bf The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nFacility Description\n\nOur facility produces manganese dioxide, boron trichloride and elemental boron using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our processes, we use and/or store the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: Chlorine and boron trichloride.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nPotential Off-Site Consequences of Accidental Releases\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about t"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nChlorine\nLiquid chlorine is stored at the EMD Acquisition LLC facility in one ton cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a cylinder rupture and 2000 pounds of chlorine, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the chlorine cloud will travel approximately 1.3 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe chlorine alternative case scenario involves a leak in the line from the storage vessel to the first process vessel.  In this scenario, approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the chlorine cloud will travel approximately 0.3 miles before the endpoint concentration (3 ppm) is met.      \n\nBoron Trichloride\nLiquid boron trichloride is stored at the EMD Acquisition LLC facility in cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a storage vessel failure and 5250 pounds of boron trichloride, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the boron trichloride cloud will travel approximately 0.25 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe boron trichloride alternative case scenario involves a leak from the storage vessel.  In this scenario, approximately 1,200 pounds of boron trichloride gas is released.  More"

The most important products of our PHAs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases.  We ensure that all recommendations from our PHAs are resolved appropriately, and we ensure that information from our PHAs (including recommendation resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees.\n\nWe conduct systematic PHAs of our regulated processes and other hazardous processes at our facility according to an established schedule.

We also conduct PHAs of all new processes before those processes are placed in service.  \n\nWe use a variety of techniques to perform PHAs, choosing techniques that are appropriate for specific applications.
