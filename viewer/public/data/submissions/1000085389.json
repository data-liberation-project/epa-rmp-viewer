              "Description": " \n\n1.0  Safety information (?68.50) \n\n\n\nSafety information has been compiled pertaining to the SCR Ammonia System to facilitate the understanding of the hazards and safety-related aspects of the equipment and processes, the limits thus placed on operations, and the accepted standards and codes that have been adopted.  The RMP and the related Safety Data Sheets, plans, procedures, drawings and other related information is maintained onsite and/or on the NRG computer server.  \n\n\n\nThe maximum intended inventory of 29.4% NH4OH at ELGS will be approximately 18,401 gallons (40,466 pounds of ammonia) contained in the storage tank and pipelines.  A summary of the process design limits (upper and lower) are included in the RMP for tank liquid level, pressure, temperature and liquid flow.  Critical process parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, liquid flow, leak detection, etc.) are continuously monitored by the Control Room that is monitored 24 hours daily by operators that can remotely shut-off critical flow control valves or the supply pumps in the event of an upset condition or a release.\n\n\n\nThe SCR Ammonia System is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Equipment design standards are detailed in the system descriptions, design drawings, and equipment manufacturer specifications and manuals maintained onsite and references in Appendix E of the RMP.  Primary industry standards and regulations include the following:  ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1; ANSI/ASME B31.3 Process Piping Code; building codes in effect at the time and have been approved by the El Segundo Building Official; and storage tank (UST) designed and operated in conformance with the California Underground Storage Tank regulations (23 CCR Division 3, Chapter 16).\n\n\n\n2.0  Hazard Review (? 68.50)\n\n\n\nAs a best management practice, the hazard review process has been upgraded to include follow the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology and are completed at least every 5 years or prior to the startup of major equipment or operational changes following the MOC process.  Seismic assessments by an independent professional engineer are also completed every 5 years.  The most recent full PHA was completed October 28,2019 and the seismic assessment was completed in November 2019.  PHA and seismic reports are maintained onsite by the Environmental Specialist.  The PHA reports describe the participating personnel, methodology used, human and natural factors considered, hazards considered, findings, and recommendations identified.  In general, a review team comprised of the NRG Environmental Specialist, ES CUPA (local administrating agency), ELGS operators and consultants used a checklist approach of What-If questions to analyze the potential hazards of the SCR Ammonia System relative to the available controls designed to minimize the realization of, or the magnitude of, the hazards.  This included hypothetical consequences of hazard events (e.g., equipment malfunction, human error, external events, etc.) that could lead to a release and the potential magnitude and impact of the release.  Recommendations of the PHA are identified in each report and are added to the RMP Recommendation Record spreadsheet maintained by the Environmental Specialist to track their status and document actions taken or determination that no additional actions are necessary after further evaluation.\n\n\n\n3.0  Operating Procedures (? 68.52)\n\n\n\nThe system descriptions, drawings and operating manuals serve as the core operating procedures that detail process and equipment design, features, operation, initial startup, normal startup, normal and emergency shutdown, troubleshooting, instrument set points, and responses to alarms.  In addition, station orders, station procedures, and inspection forms provide specific instruction to operators and maintenance personnel for safely conducting tasks and activities.  The NRG Corporate Safety Manual requires safe work practices provide for the control of hazards, including lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control over entrance into a stationary source by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel.  When upset conditions occur, a specific evaluation is conducted and, if necessary, using the Management of Change (MOC) procedure, controls are implemented as needed, including developing specific temporary procedures and training.  Startup following a normal major outage on the SCR Ammonia System requires a MOC that includes pre-startup checklist.  ELGS reviews and updates operating procedures as needed to assure that they reflect current operating practice, or whenever they are found to be inadequate or inaccurate.  \n\n \n\n\n\n4.0  Training (? 68.54)\n\n\n\nELGS has instituted a comprehensive training program designed to ensure competency for personnel with responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the SCR Ammonia System.  The training approach is a combination of both on-the-job training and classroom training to familiarize workers with the equipment, operating procedures and requirements.  Managers, supervisors, and experienced operators provide on-the-job training to workers to provide them with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that they need to safely conduct their duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.  The Safety & Health Training Program requires supervision to ensure that training of employees who can demonstrate an understanding of issues before starting work, including completing job hazard a safety analysis and change analysis of existing and new operations.  Training of affected employees includes the various safety programs and procedures (e.g., contractor safety, emergency response, hazard communications, hazard reporting, hot work, lock out/tag out, personal protective equipment [PPE], preventative maintenance, etc.).  \n\n\n\nContractors are specifically required to provide competent supervision and employees who are qualified and trained for the type of work that they will perform, providing all applicable training and safety instructions, and assuring that safe work practices are followed.  When appropriate prior to major maintenance or modifications, contractors participate in MOC, including the development of job-specific procedures and training.  \n\n\n\n5.0  Maintenance (? 68.56)\n\n\n\nThe system descriptions and operating and instruction manuals identify the maintenance required for the equipment, including the equipment manufacturer?s manuals for reference.  These have been incorporated into the preventative maintenance software used to schedule, generate, and track completion of work orders for routine maintenance of the equipment and instrumentation.  The Technical & Maintenance Manager is responsible for ensuring the proper maintenance of the equipment for on-going mechanical integrity, reliability and developing safe procedures for performing the required tasks.  Inspection and testing procedures follow recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency of inspections and tests of equipment are consistent with applicable manufacturers? recommendations, industry standards, good engineering practices and prior operating experience.\n\n\n\nRoutine maintenance is performed by ELGS employees and is generally limited to inspection and testing of equipment and instrumentation without accessing the sealed tanks or piping following station orders and safety practices with minimal risk of exposure to NH4OH.  Major maintenance procedures that involve potential exposure to NH4OH or NH3 are developed and approved through the Management of Change process that involves both employees and specialized contractors with experience working with ammonia.  Records of maintenance is available on the NRG server or in the maintenance management software.  The Technical & Maintenance Manager is responsible for the development of the necessary procedures, as needed, and for providing training to affected workers to ensure that they can safely perform the required activity.  \n\n  \n\n6.0  Compliance Audits (? 68.58)\n\n\n\nFormal compliance audits by qualified consultants are conducted at least every 3 years.  The most recent Compliance Audit was completed on December 13, 2018 on the Existing Process by Ammonia Process Safety Management.  Findings and recommendations of the compliance audits are identified in each report and are added to the RMP Recommendation Record spreadsheet to track their status and document actions taken or determination that no additional actions are necessary after further evaluation.  Past audit reports are maintained onsite by the Environmental Specialist. \n\n\n\n7.0  Incident Investigations (? 68.60)\n\n\n\nAll incidents which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release from the SCR Ammonia System must be investigated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. The NRG Incident Management Process provides the approach to incident management, from initial notification, investigation, data collection and analysis, and determination of causal factors and root causes, and completion of corrective actions.  Findings and recommendations will be promptly addressed, resolved, and actions taken documented with completion dates within one and one half (1.5) years after completion of the incident investigation or two (2) years after the date of the incident, whichever is earlier, or the next planned turnaround for those items requiring a turnaround (unless otherwise negotiated with El Segundo CUPA).  Once completed, a summary report must be prepared for incorporation into an update to this RMP that include, at a minimum, the following information:  1) Date of incident, 2) Date investigation began, 3) Description of the incident, 4) Factors that contributed to the incident, and, 5) Findings and recommendations resulting from the investigation.  Findings shall be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are affected by the findings.  Investigation summaries shall be retained for five years.\n\n ",

      "SummaryText": " \n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) describes the worst-case scenario for a release of aqueous ammonia (NH4OH) and the controls established at the El Segundo Generating Station (ELGS) to minimize the possibility of an accidental release and to mitigate the effects of a release, should one occur. These include underground storage of the Ammonia Tank and Emergency Shutdown Systems. The worst-case release scenario and alternative-case release scenario results in a predicted distance (0.1 miles) to the toxic endpoint value established for ammonia (0.14 milligrams per liter) that is within the distance to a public and environmental receptor, the shoreline adjoining ELGS to the west.  The SCR Ammonia System is not subject to the Cal/OSHA process safety management standards at 8 CCR 5189 and has been determined to be a Program Level 2 regulated process.  This RMP represents a complete 5-year update.  \n\n\n\nThe complete RMP also includes two separate and independent processes, known as the Ammonia Dosing Systems, that contain 19% NH4OH used as water treatment additive for the unit condensate.  The Ammonia Dosing Systems are not covered processes but are included in the RMP relative to release prevention as a best management practice.  Collectively, the covered SCR Ammonia System and the two Ammonia Dosing Systems are referred to in the RMP as the Aqueous Ammonia System.    \n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe design of the SCR Ammonia System integrates accidental release prevention controls through its features of construction, automated operation and control, and continuous monitoring of critical process conditions.  The system is controlled and monitored by the combination of equipment-specific Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), and the power plant Distributed Control System (DCS) that is continuously monitored by operators in the Control Room.  This is supplemented with daily monitoring "
