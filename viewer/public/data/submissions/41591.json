      "SummaryText": "The City of Sweetwater's chlorine feed is made up of two 1 ton cylinders.  One for pre-chlorination and one for post chlorination.  These are 3 roto-meters, 2 for pre-chlorine and one for post chlorine, which restricts the discharge of chlorine to each destination point.  The chlorine room is equipped with exhaust fans.  The plant has two Scott Air-paks and a one ton cylinder repair kit.  A mock disaster has been staged at the plant with water plant operators and fire department personnel were used in repairing a 1 ton cylinder with the CL2 kit and recorded on a video for future training.  It is my belief that if a leak occurred at the water plant it might be a valve on the end of a cylinder and could be repaired with our repair kit in 10 to 15 minutes."
