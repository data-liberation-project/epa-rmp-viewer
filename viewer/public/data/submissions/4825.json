Operations at Tippecanoe Labs began in 1954.  Tippecanoe Labs owns over 2000 acres, including farmland and a wildlife habitat.  The plant itself includes 128 buildings on 500 acres.\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Tippecanoe Labs has designed and implemented, including:\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n3.  The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios, including administrative \n     controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n5.  Five-year accident history\n6.  The emergency response program\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  Tippecanoe Labs has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  Tippecanoe Labs' accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemic"

Lilly is also thoroughly prepared to respond to accidents and other incidents with fully trained response teams.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impact of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nTippecanoe Laboratories actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighborhood groups.  These panels provide feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors. \n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nTippecanoe Labs is divided into three main functional areas.  Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing manufactures bulk drug substances and clinical trials materials for human health products.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Incineration Services, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.  Fermented Products Manufacturing manufactures antibiotics and animal feed additives.  This area includes manufacturing facilities, Environmental Controls, Solvent Recovery, and storage tanks.

WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that Tippecanoe Labs provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for the facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses anhydrous ammonia as a raw material in fermented products manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the tank (35,000 pounds) in ten minutes.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 3.1 miles.  Approximately 55,000 residents may be affected by this release.  Procedures and alarms limit the volume in the anhydrous ammonia tank to 85% of the tank capacity.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemical - Ethyl Ether\n\nTippecanoe Labs uses ethyl ether as a solvent in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  This worst-case release scenario involves the entire contents of the tank (44,000 pounds) vaporizing, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's RMP Comp program, using an endpoint distance of an overpressure of 1 psi., the flammable endpoint is 0.3 miles.  No residents may be affected, but the explosion may reach a recreation area, the Wabash River.\n\nAlternative Case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a pipe from the tank being sheared, allowing the contents of the tank (35,000 pounds) to escape in 19 minutes.
