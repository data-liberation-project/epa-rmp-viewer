Senior management is actively involved with employees in establishing and maintaining an effective safety and health program.  Managers participate with employees in ongoing safety and health program activities, including:\nv Promoting safety and health through active personal example and committee participation;\nv Providing safety and health education and training for employees, supervisors and managers; and\nv Reviewing, updating and enforcing workplace safety and health rules.\n\nIn addition to our corporate policy, Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. has established a program committed to reviewing and improving our chemical processes with regard to safety and the environment as developing technology provides us with better and more efficient means. \n\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc.'s ammonia process is also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  Through this program we continually evaluate our ammonia handling and storage process for identification and mitigation of safety and environmental hazards.\n\nFacility Description\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc., located in Hastings, Nebraska, was constructed in 1984. Major expansions completed in 1993 and 1999 have resulted in the plant having the capacity to produce 65 Mmgal per year of fuel grade ethanol.  \nEthanol is produced by fermentation process from locally grown corn and milo.  Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. is processing approximately 1,800 tons of grain per day.  In addition to ethanol production, the plant produces nearly 400 tons per year of distiller's grains (both wet and dry) that is used as an animal feed supplement.\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at our facility in the fermentation process for pH adjustment and as a nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored at our plant in an 18,000-gallon capacity bullet tank.\n\nWorst Case Release Scena"

Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. maintains a preventative maintenance program to assure the integrity of the ammonia tank and piping system.  System operators are trained in the safe handling of ammonia.\n\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. selected an alternative release scenario as an ammonia release from a ? inch pipe.  In the event of a release, facility personnel have been trained to respond by applying a water spray that effectively neutralizes the ammonia, which reduces off-site impacts.  Additionally, piping leaks can typically be isolated and blocked out to prevent further loss of tank contents.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIn the event of an ammonia release, ourwritten plan requires and employees are trained to evacuate non-critical plant personnel.  The emergency response team will don the appropriate protective equipment to assess and mitigate the ammonia release as necessary.\nPlant management staff will notify the local response authorities if it is determined that there is a potential for off-site impact.  The local emergency management agency can activate the county notification system, if necessary, to alert the public.  Nearby businesses and residences within a one-mile radius of Chief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. will be notified by telephone by plant personnel that a release has occurred. \nPlant employees (were applicable) receive both initial and ongoing training on emergency response procedures, on safe handling of ammonia, unloading procedures and process safety management.\n\nPlanned Changes\nChief Ethanol Fuels, Inc. continues to evaluate the future use of anhydrous ammonia with anhydrous ammonia substitutes.
