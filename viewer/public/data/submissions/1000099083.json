As Ammonia Liquid is needed in the system, it is fed from the Receiver through Liquid Filters to several Evaporators and as Liquid Makeup to several vessels.\n\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is fed to the Purgers. Purged Gas is piped from the Purge Points to the Purgers. This system has several Purge Points. The Evaporative Condensers Purge Points are on the Condensed Liquid Drain Outlets. Any non-condensables in the Vapor Stream are removed periodically by the Purgers. The Purge Gas is separated by Purgers. It separates ammonia from the non-condensables by condensing the ammonia into a liquid. Any non-condensables are piped to a Water Bubbler to remove any traces of ammonia. Condensed Vapor is piped back to a Vessel.\n\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is fed to two Suction Accumulators as liquid make-up. The Suction Accumulators provide for return of Low Temperature Re-circulated Suction (gas/liquid combination) LTRS from the system on a continuous basis. The vapor returns through LSS to compressors. The liquid drops out into the vessels and gravity drains to two Transfer Vessels. The vessels fill up and the controls force hot gas into the transfer vessels forcing the ammonia liquid to transfer back to the High Pressure Receiver R-1.\n\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is also fed through a coil in the Intercooler. While circulating through the coil inside the Intercooler, the liquid rejects heat into the surrounding vapor, thus cooling the liquid. The Sub-Cooled Liquid from the Intercooler is fed into the Low Temperature Recirculators and also fed to several Evaporators and Heat Exchangers throughout the facility.\n\n\nHigh Pressure Liquid is also fed to Intercooler for liquid make-up.

We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility. Our goal is to promote worker, public, and plant safety!\n\n\nThis is a 5 year RMP submittal for the Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream facility, located at 3426 Wells Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana. We manufacture some of the finest packaged ice cream and ice cream snacks in the world. Some of the equipment in the facility includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials, warehousing, two ammonia refrigeration engine rooms (process and warehouse), refrigerated storage, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Also located at the facility is raw milk processing equipment, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment equalization system. The facility produces and ships millions of pounds of products each year.\n\n\nThe refrigeration systems required for our facility necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The process refrigeration system contains in excess of 45,353 pounds of anhydrous ammonia while the warehouse refrigeration system contains in excess of 52,333 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The site therefore has a total of 97,686 pounds of ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia to the atmosphere. The plant also has many policies and procedures to minimize the potenti"

These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is detected, employees are to notify the onsite Refrigeration Technicians, who are Hazmat Responders. The site also has numerous ammonia detector devices located throughout the facility that would alert employees, and especially the Refrigeration Technicians, of a leak. The detector ppm levels are displayed in the ammonia engine room control room. The Hazmat Responder takes an ammonia level reading using a detection device. If the Hazmat Responder determines that the ammonia level is above 35 ppm, an evacuation of the exposure area is ordered. If an evacuation is necessary, an Incident Commander takes control of the situation.\n\n\nThe Hazmat Responder and/or Incident Commander will determines if the leak is serious enough that outside assistance is needed. If outside assistance is needed, the local HAZMAT organization is contacted and the internal Hazmat/Emergency Response Team is mobilized. \n\nThe Hazmat Responders then take appropriate action to mitigate the leak. They are trained in plant procedures, such as Emergency Shutdown Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's), to control the leak with appropriate personal protective devices in place.\n\n\nDreyer's Grand Ice Cream is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility.

The following is a summary of the ammonia release that occurred on May 17, 2022:\n\n\nThe plant was expanding the capacity in the warehouse engine room to handle the future additions. TJW Industrial is the Refrigeration contractor that is performing the work. \n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, TJW was staging parts for the next day. They used a forklift with a large mast to bring in parts into the warehouse engine room. While doing this task, the mast struck the thermosyphon supply line feeding the oil cooler for WLC-11 (OCWLC-11). When this piping moved, it created a crack in the Thermosyphon Supply (TSS) connection on the oil cooler OCWLC-11 which resulted in an ammonia release. \n\nThe driver of the forklift and the spotter were able to escape without injury. The plant\u0092s refrigeration personnel (Hazmat Responders) responded immediately and the leak was isolated completely within 28 minutes. The leak resulted in a release of 1,179.6 lbs of ammonia. No off-site impact was made.   \n\nAll notifications were made to the proper agencies. A complete leak investigation was assembled and a thorough investigation was completed. Several recommendations were made to prevent future occurrences, and these have since been implemented.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNestle Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream holds monthly PSM team Meetings, led by the on-site Industrial Service Manager. The facility has OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Programs, and has a partnership with a local contractor, TJW Industrial, who specializes in these areas. The facility also has ongoing training, including a specialized training program for the Refrigeration techs that work on the ammonia system. Other items include annual Mechanical I"
