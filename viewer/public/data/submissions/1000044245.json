All employees are trained in there specific roles when responding to an emergency. The manuals are kept in strategic locations throughout the facilities and are readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system that cycles refrigerant, or ammonia, from a ligiud to gas and back to liquid again. The system, consisting of vessels, and interconnecting piping, valaves, and process equipment,cycles ammonia through various stataes(high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid,low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\n\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature: lowering thje ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.
