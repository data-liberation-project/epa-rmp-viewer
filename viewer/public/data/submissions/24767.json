Our safety \n\nand environmental programs are managed by highly skilled employees, and are actively supported \n\nby the participation of all employees and all management, and a strong corporate staff. The \n\ngoal of both the safety and environmental programs is prevention. Safety teams which focus on \n\ntraining and special projects have been formed in every department across this site. Although \n\nP&G's safety record is already among the best in the business, we are constantly striving for \n\nimprovement. \n\n\n\nP&G is very committed to the safety and protection of the local residents. P&G employees are \n\nactive members of several of  the local fire departments, response groups and other community, \n\nincluding Rotary and Keep CENLA Beautiful.   P&G has also supported the community in areas \n\nsuch as supplying mitigation materials to aid the city with a transportation incident.  \n\n\n\nP&G is also very committed to the safety and protection of the natural environment.  P&G \n\nAlexandria site employees have participated in the local Earth Day celebrations, have provided \n\nenvironmental training in schools, and is active in the Partners in Education program with \n\nNorthwood High School. \n\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE + SUBSTANCES: PREVENTION, CONTROLS + MITIGATION  \n\n\n\nThe P&G Alexandria site manufactures laundry detergent. Oleum is one of the key raw materials \n\nused to make the detergent. Oleum is delivered to the site by specially designed railcars, and \n\nis unloaded into a storage tank. While not required by any regulation, our storage tank is made \n\nof extra-thick stainless steel and designed to meet Pressure Vessel code details.  Additionally,\n\nthey are located in a diked area and enclosed in  a metal building. The tanks "

The storage and unloading areas are monitored by continuous video cameras \n\nplaced in critical areas. The storage tanks are heated to the minimum level in order to keep \n\nthe oleum in a liquid state for use in our process. Slight wisps or vapors which may occur when \n\nopening the railcar for unloading and during maintenance are collected in a mist vacuum and \n\nscrubber system. Oleum is completely consumed in the reactions in the processes. \n\n\n\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS:  Minimizing the potential for accidental releases\n\n\n\nA \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA as an instantaneous release of the single largest \n\nvessel (the storage tank), outdoors, during a time of light winds and stable weather conditions. \n\nAn instantaneous release of this kind could be caused by, for example,  an earthquake or by an \n\nairplane hitting the tank. The worst case release assumes that no emergency response would occur,\n\neven though both site personnel and the local Haz Mat team are trained to respond to this type \n\nof spill. The spilled liquid contents of an entire storage tank would be confined to an existing\n\ndiked area. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is defined by the EPA as a 15 minute release from a leaking \n\nunloading line at more normal weather conditions. If necessary, the foam suppression systems \n\nand/or shutting valves to shut down the operation could be activated  within 15 minutes.   \n\nThe facility has also modeled its Alternative Release Scenario.  This scenario can also be \n\nlocated in the RMPlan.\n\n\n\nSAFETY, RELEASE PREVENTION, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\n\n\nThe first line of defense at our plant is accident prevention. A  detailed hazard study was \n\nconducted to identify potential points from which oleum may be spilled or leaked from the \n\nprocess. These points have received special consideration during the process design, the \n\ntraining of oper"

The studies are updated routinely by a team of specially \n\ntrained employees and engineers. Training, maintenance, controls, operating practices, and \n\npurchasing requirements are updated based on the results of these hazard studies. \n\n\n\nThe entire oleum system has numerous and redundant process controls, detection and alarm \n\nsystems, and an emergency shut-down system. When operating, highly skilled operators monitor \n\nthe process from the control rooms equipped with cameras and computers that monitor important \n\ndata on the liquid levels in the tanks, the temperature and pressure of the tank contents, \n\nand the tank's volume.  Oleum is only unloaded into a tank when there is enough space to \n\nallow unloading all the contents of the railcar.  This procedure of hookup-unload- disconnect \n\nonly once per railcar  minimizes the risk of accidental spills.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accident, the site has systems to react to the spill or leak quickly. \n\nSpills or leaks of oleum can be quickly communicated by personnel on the scene from phones \n\nlocated in the control rooms. The Police and Fire departments have procedures to  manage \n\ncommunications and instructions to the public by means of TV and radio broadcasts, and by \n\ndirect communications in the streets of affected neighborhoods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHISTORY OF SAFE OPERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe P&G Alexandria site has an excellent history of oleum system safety.
