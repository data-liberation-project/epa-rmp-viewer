Liquid hydrogen is produced by putting hydrogen gas through a series of compression, cooling and expansion steps. The liquid hydrogen is stored in two 70,000 gallon liquid hydrogen tanks and the backup 20,000 gallon tank.  Liquid hydrogen is loaded into highway tankers and shipped to various off-site customers. Liquid hydrogen stored on site is pure hydrogen. \r\n\r\nREFORMER PROCESS: Hydrocarbon based gases (natural gas or methane) are received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock.  The feed stock is then compressed and cracked in our reformer (furnace).  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,500 degrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is then separated from the hydrogen in adsorbers.  The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to customers or the hydrogen liquifier via pipe. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is the flammable mixture (hydrogen and methane). \r\n\r\nThe site stores liquid hydrogen in two 70,000 gallon tanks and one 20,000 gallon tank.

Hydrogen and methane, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections,  safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).
