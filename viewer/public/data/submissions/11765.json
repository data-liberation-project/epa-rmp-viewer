The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release that could have had adverse effects on the public.  \n\nEmergency Response\n\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Kensico Facility has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Fire Department. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the Fire Department who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release.                 \n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n\nThe NYC DEP continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect employees and the community we serve. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.S1FACILITY|RMP*Submit|1.0.7|F|Kensico (Shaft 18)|New York City Dept. of Environmental Protection||||155563711|073299026||Kensico South Effluent Chamber|20 West Lake Drive|Valhalla|NY|10595||119|410435.6|-0734611.1|I4|UN|NYC Dept. of Env.

Kensico is one of the locations where some of the City's water is treated with chlorine.\n\nNew York City DEP is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \n\nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe NYC DEP has conducted an offsite consequence analysis including the regulatory required, but extremely unlikely, worst-case release scenario (i.e., total release from the single largest container over a ten minute period and assuming worst case meteorological conditions).   Results of this worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors would be affected. \n\nA release represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine containers (they are designed to withstand transportation mishaps) and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at the Kensico Facility.  \n\nIn fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\n Alternative Release Scenario\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario was selected as the Kensico al"

This scenario assumes that the liquid chlorine header connected to the container is completely severed and chlorine is released over a ten-minute period. Results of this credible worst-case event indicate that offsite receptors could be affected.\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nDEP is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, an individual, designated as the RMP Responsible Manager, has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the NYC DEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\nChlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\nProcess Safety Information to document the safe process design;\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n\nOperating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n\nMaintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\n\nTraining, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and k"
