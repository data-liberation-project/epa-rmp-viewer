The RPC-FF ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 25,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n  \nRPC-FF endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to our Associates, customers, and the community by providing our Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job. RPC-FF's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates or the community to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nRPC-FF has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Chapter 4, Subchapter 7, Group 16, Article 109 (Cal/OSHA), and California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 (CalARP).  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency action plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, Associate training, etc.).  In addition, Rich Products Corporation has generated \"The 15 Point Plus Health and Safety Program\" which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be implemented at each Rich Products Corporation Facility.  \n\nRPC-FF has performed a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario t"

The worst case release scenario would impact approximately a 0.8 mile radius from the facility and the alternative release scenario would impact approximately a 0.4 mile radius from the facility.  Therefore, each scenario has a potential offsite impact.  The worst case release scenario looked at a potential release from the south engine room intercooler which contains approximately 3,700 pounds of ammonia.  The alternative release scenario dealt with a potential release from the high pressure receiver which contains approximately 3,400 pounds of ammonia.  USEPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration reference tables and equations were used in determining the worst case and alternative release scenarios offsite impacts.  A release of either nature is unlikely due to the following:  RPC-FF Associates perform routine visual inspections and maintenance on all components which comprise the system.  The system has computer generated work orders for maintenance activities that are time dependant.  The high pressure receiver and the intercooler have liquid level cut outs which would minimize the amount of ammonia released and includes liquid level sight glasses which are inspected periodically and must remain within a safe operating range or the system is shutdown.  The high pressure receiver and the intercooler also are monitored for pressure and will result in an automatic system shutdown if a high pressure situation is reached.  The high pressure receiver and the intercooler have solenoid valves which control the flow to each device and will open and close dependant upon the liquid levels detected and thereby minimize the potential of a release.  Each vessel has pressure relief valves which will vent to the roof if a high pressure situation is encountered.\n\nRPC-FF has had no accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  \n\nRPC-FF has developed an emergency action plan in comp"

RPC-FF has coordinated all emergency response activities with the Fresno Fire Department and the Fresno Fire Department will perform all HAZMAT activities at the facility.  The emergency action plan establishes the procedures necessary to follow in case of an ammonia release as well as the order of notification for off-site responders.  Associates will receive the training required to recoginize an ammonia release and to intiate the emergency action plan procedures by notifying the proper authorities.  Table top emergency drills and evacuation drills are conducted periodically that simulate potential emergency conditions.  RPC-FF's emergency action plan includes:  pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties (e.g., the Fresno Fire Department), drills and preparedness acitivities to respond to a potential ammonia release, Associates roles, lines of authority, training and communication, emergency recognition and prevention, safe distances and places of refuge, site security and control, evacuation routes and procedures, emergency medical treatment and first aid, emergency alerting and response procedures, and critique of response and follow-up reports to improve the efficiency and execution of the emergency action plan."
