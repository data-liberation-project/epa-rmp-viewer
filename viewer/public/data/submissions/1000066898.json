Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Rose Hill Terminal is coordinated with the Duplin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Dorothy Cavenaugh is the contact for the LEPC (910-296-2160 ext. 232).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Rose Hill Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability. Crestwood operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations, and the Rose Hill Terminal provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFive - Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to Crestwood personnel the Rose Hill Terminal has had no accidents in the last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Rose Hill Terminal resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process."

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per Crestwood's Risk Management Protocol.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Rose Hill Terminal periodically updates and r"

      "SummaryText": "idstream Partners encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The Rose Hill Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrica"

      "SummaryText": "Crestwood Services\r\nRose Hill Terminal\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrestwood Midstream Partners, owner and operator of the Rose Hill Terminal, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Crestwood Rose Hill Terminal, is a wholesale distribution location for Crestwood propane sales. The Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) product arrives at the facility via rail tank car. Up to (15) rail tank cars are left on site until the LPG can be transferred into (6) existing storage tanks for onsite storage. From the tank storage, LPG is loaded on to trucks using a new terminal automation system. This facility is designed with equipment to enable truck drivers to enter the facility and load trucks via operator interface terminals. When loading is complete, the system will print an appropriate Bill of Lading for transportation.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the terminal are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains one source of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; liquefied propane gas (LPG). \r\n \r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nProcesses at the Rose Hill Terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program 3 (RMP) regulation. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nCrestwood M"
