      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station, which is operated by Cleco Power, LLC Evangeline, LLC is located in St. Landry, Evangeline Parish, Louisiana. This facility is required to implement a Risk Management Program due to the type and quantity of toxic chemical that is located onsite.\r\n \r\nThe Coughlin Power Station's environmental, safety, and health policies emphasize the importance of safeguarding our employees, contractors, the environment and the community from potential exposures to chemical materials, by-products and end products, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment, in which its activities are carried out. The Coughlin Power Station has implemented programs to ensure compliance with regulations and continued improvement of environmental, health and safety performance over the years. One part of these programs is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated toxic substance stored onsite above the applicable threshold quantity. There are no RMP regulated chemicals that exceed RMP thresholds. \r\nChlorine is also stored on site; however it is stored in quantities below the threshold quantity for chlorine. It should be noted however that chlorine is stored in quantities above the threshold quantity under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, to its employees, and to the preservation of the environment. One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The Coughlin Power Station utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  The Coughlin Power Station"

      "SummaryText": "'s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained emergency response teams will make necessary efforts to contain, mitigate, monitor, and/or stop the release. In addition to handling the release, the facility has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case release as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. A Worst-Case Release Scenario (WCS) analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process. WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and an ambient air temperature of 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F). Topography for WCSs is distinguished between rural and urban. Rural terrain was chosen as a conservative input.\r\n\r\nToxic gases include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25\u00b0 C, 77\u00b0F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration. For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.\r\n\r\nFor toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface. For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released for the pipeline is assumed to form a pool. Passive mitigation systems may be accounted for in the consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids. In this scenario, the Toxic Endpoint was determined to be 0.14 mg/L using the RMP*Comp program.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, being the only toxic substance exceeding the threshold quantity, was determined to result in the WCS for regulated tox"

The distance to the endpoint of a 10-minute release of the entire quantity of the anhydrous ammonia was calculated using the RMP*Comp program and determined to be 3.6 miles. Based on this distance, a WCS of this toxic would affect a population of approximately 722 individuals. There are three anhydrous ammonia tanks at the site; the tanks are identical in construction, capacity and function. Population data within the 3.6 mile radius of each tank was examined.  The tank that resulted in the highest potentially affected population was selected as the center point for the worst-case release analysis. The approximated affected population data was obtained from the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Missouri Census Data Center (2018), Circular Area Profiles 2010 [dataset application]. \r\n\r\nAn Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those cited for a WCS. One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a covered process that exceeds threshold quantity. For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\r\n\r\nAlternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fence line. Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\r\n\r\nAs per the regulations at 40 CFR 68.28, Coughlin Power Station considered the following scenarios as alternative scenarios:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tTransfer hose releases due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling \r\n\u00bf\tProcess piping releases from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves and valve seals, and drains or bleeds\r\n\u00bf\tProcess vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure\r\n\u00bf\tVessel overfilling and spill, or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks\r\n\u00bf\tShippi"

A one-inch hole in the vessel causes an airborne release from a one-inch opening at a pressure of 145 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). The release is assumed to continue for 10 minutes as the liquid vaporizes immediately. The height of the liquid column above the hole is approximately two feet. The release rate of the anhydrous ammonia was determined to be approximately 2,400 lbs/minute. Active mitigation (water deluge system) was considered. The distance to the endpoint of a 10-minute release at a rate of 2,400 lbs/minute of anhydrous ammonia was calculated using the RMP*Comp program and determined to be 0.9 mile. Based on this distance, an ARS of this toxic would affect a population of approximately 192 individuals. There are three anhydrous ammonia tanks at the site; the tanks are identical in construction, capacity and function. Population data within the 0.9-mile radius of each tank was examined.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and are documented and retained. The final resolution of the recommendations is also documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and are updated by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process. In addition, the operating procedures discuss consequences of deviating from the safe limits and provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. Changes to operating procedures are tracked through the management of change (MOC) process.\r\nTraining \r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a training program for all employees involved in process operation.

      "SummaryText": "employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive ongoing training and refresher courses on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level and to continually enhance the capabilities of the employees. This refresher training is conducted every three years. Training in operating procedures is confirmed with a written test. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station uses contractors to supplement its work force. Some contractors work on or near process equipment; therefore, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. The contractor safety program places stringent qualification requirements on contracting firms before entering the facility to perform work. Contractors provide training documentation of their employees that meet or exceed the requirement of the job scope. Contractors are provided with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, (3) safe work practices, and (4) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to beginning work. \r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the facility to (1) inform contract employers of potential hazards related to the work, (2) explain Cleco"

The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides additional checks to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The reviewer uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A review involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station has implemented practices and procedures to ensure that facility equipment is in a safe operating condition. The mechanical integrity program is designed to ensure that plant equipment is maintained in/at the minimum designed specification. The basic aspects of this program include (1) the development of a maintenance schedule for equipment, (2) developing written mechanical integrity procedures, (3) conducting training, (4) performing and documenting inspections and tests, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality ass"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station has a documented inspection program that enhances the integrity of critical equipment and systems at the facility. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job safely. Written procedures help to ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). Recommendations from equipment inspections are then prioritized and implemented accordingly. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service or facility personnel will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Coughlin Power Station has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.
