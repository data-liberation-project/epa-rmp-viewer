The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the facility:\nThe Linde Gas, LLC facility located in Twinsburg, Ohio complies with USEPA's accident prevention rule, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  All process equipment is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA standards.  If an emergency accidental release were to occur involving our propane or acetylene storage/handling systems, it is our policy to immediately notify the Twinsburg Fire Department and the Linde Gas emergency response team, who would respond to the emergency.  In addition, we have implemented programs related to Process Safety Management and Security Vulnerability Risk Assessment.  Corporate / Senior management provides support for all compliance requirements through training information and training programs.  Monthly safety meetings are required by corporate policy.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe Linde Gas facility manufactures acetylene and stores propane in above ground storage tanks (ASTs).  Both gases are put into storage cylinders of various sizes before they are sold and shipped from the facility.   The propane storage/handling process consists of one 30,000-gallon propane AST, propane cylinder filling equipment, filled propane cylinders of various sizes, and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.  The acetylene manufacturing/handling/storage process consists of a low pressure acetylene generator and a high pressure cylinder filling area.  The low pressure acetylene generator uses calcium carbide to generate acetylene gas that is purified and stored in a \"gas holder\".  The acetylene that is generated in the low pressure generator is piped to the high pressure cylinder fill area where it is compressed and routed through manifolds that are used to fill multiple cylinders.  \n\n3.
