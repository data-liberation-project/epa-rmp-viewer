      "SummaryText": "Zuckerman Mandeville, Inc is a fresh vegetable packing facility who is committed to safety and complies with OSHA PSM and EPA-RMP AIB. This commitment is enforced and monitored through periodic inspections and meetings at the facility. Our safety policy is to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities. This policy is administered through a safety program which includes chlorine safety, forklift safety, lockout / tagout, employee safety trainings, manufacturers and documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility uses Chlorine on washing step to disinfect and preserve fresh marketable potatoes (June-October)\n\nChlorine Gas is stored in 1 ton container; it is liquefied by pressure and distributed to a pre-washing tank and to three washers thru a vacuum eductor. The facility stores usually no more than 3 full containers (with 2,000lbs each). Containers are stored in a safe and locked area.  \n\nIt is recommended to have between 100 to 200 ppm of available chlorine for potatoes when applied by spray with a contact time of 5-30 sec. Chlorine levels are monitored and recorded every 2-3 hours.\n\nZuckerman Mandeville, Inc. has not had any reportable chlorine releases during the past 5 years (June 2005 - June 2010). No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the water chlorination process."
