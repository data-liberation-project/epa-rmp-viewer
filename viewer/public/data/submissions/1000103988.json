We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling and freezing medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels\r\nin our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown\r\ndevices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We have a preventative maintenance program designed\r\nto maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable\r\ntrained personnel to respond to system upsets.\r\n\r\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\r\n\r\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.\r\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\nEmployee Participation Program\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining Program\r\nContractor Safety Program\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\r\nMechanical Integrity Program\r\nHot Work Permit Procedures\r\nManagement of Change Procedures\r\nIncident Investigation Procedures\r\nCompliance Audit Procedures\r\n\r\nD.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\nAn emergency action program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies,\r\nincluding evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials.\r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nBased on the PHA for anhydrous ammonia, a list of action items were developed. The status of those action items will be monitored to ensure implementation of the safety improvements is\r\naccomplished."
