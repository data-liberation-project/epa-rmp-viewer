Chlorine liquid is corrosive to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin.  At normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, liquid chlorine readily vaporizes to gas.  Chlorine gas causes severe irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract with eye injury, restlessness, shortness of breath, cough, choking sensation, sneezing, running nose, chest pain, dizziness, headache, nausea, cyanosis (lack of oxygen in the blood) and respiratory failure.  Following respiratory tract injury, onset of severe breathing difficulties, including bronchitis, lung edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs) and pneumonia, may be delayed and life threatening.  Exposure to concentrations as low as 5-10 ppm is reported to cause severe irritation of the eyes, nose and respiratory tract, which is intolerable after a few minutes.  The threshold odor concentration of chlorine is reported to range from 0.3-3.5 ppm. Repeated exposure to chlorine can result in loss of the ability to detect the odor of chlorine. \n\nReactivity and Corrosiveness:\n\nConditions to Avoid:  \nThe presence of moisture in gaseous and liquid chlorine corrosive attack on most common metals. Chlorine will react with water or steam to produce toxic and corrosive fumes of hydrogen chloride.  \n\n\n\nMaterials to Avoid:  \nChlorine is a powerful oxidizing agent which reacts violently with a variety of substances over a broad range of conditions including reducing agents and combustible materials.

      "SummaryText": "It should be kept away from materials such as acetylene, turpentine, other hydrocarbons, ammonia, hydrocarbons, certain metal hydrides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, easily oxidized materials, hydrogen ether, powdered metals, sulfur and aluminum.  Chlorine reacts with hydrogen sulfide and water forming hydrochloric acid.  It combines with carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide to form phosgene and sulfuryl chloride, respectively, which are toxic and corrosive substances.  \n\nHazardous Decomposition Products:  \nChlorine does not decompose but reacts violently to form Hydrochloric Acid and other potentially toxic and/or corrosive substances.  Chlorine is stable in steel containers at room temperature when dry.  Intense local heat on steel walls can cause the steel to react and glow in presence of chlorine.\n\nPermissible Exposure Limits:   \nOSHA's PEL for Chlorine is 5ppm, STEL is 1ppm, NIOSH's IDLH is 10ppm\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheet (MSDS):\nA copy of the chlorine MSDS is presented as Attachment A.\n Program 3 Prevention Program:\n\n1.0     Chlorination Process Specification\n\n? Maximum Intended Inventory:  One-ton cylinders of chlorine are used at El Mirage WWTP.  The maximum intended inventory at the chlorine facility is 4 cylinders. \n\n? Safe Upper/Lower Limits: As referenced in the Chlorine Institute Manual, the following are considered safe limits for chlorine containers:\n\n- Safe Upper Temperature - 150?

All replacement equipment and/or parts meet vendor design specification.\n\n5.0    Management of Change\n\nThe Management of Change (MOC) program assists the plant staff in maintaining control over changes to the processes by subjecting such changes to strict technical review and formal authorization.  The MOC program also ensures that process changes affecting existing procedures are reflected in new written procedures.  \n\nWritten Procedures to Manage Changes         \n\nWhenever a design or operational change is proposed, the responsible person must determine if any of the following will change:\n\n? process chemistry, changes in chemical reaction, or chemical phase\n? quantity or composition of chlorine, additives, or reactants that would affect the chlorine\n? safe operating limits pertaining to temperature, pressure, and flow rates\n? consequences of deviation from safe operating limits\n? operating procedures\n? electrical classification or materials of construction\n? design specifications\n? other affected equipment, operations, or procedures\n? If any of the items listed above are changed by the proposed process change, then MOC procedures shall be followed .\n\n\n\nConsiderations Prior to Any Change\n\n? Technical Basis for the Proposed Change:  There shall be a sound technical basis for the change.  In other words, the change should bring about an improvement in production, quality, efficiency, safety, or cost.  If there is not a sound technical basis for the change, it shall not be undertaken.\n\n? Impact of Change on Safety and Health:  If the otherwise advantageous change would bring about a detrimental effect on employee safety or health, there shall be counter measures taken to ensure that the level of safety and health is not adversely affected after the change.

Modifications to Operating Procedures:  If the change will affect any operating procedures pertaining to the process, revised procedures shall be developed immediately before the change goes into effect.  Affected employees shall be trained in the procedural changes.\n\n? Necessary Time Period for the Change:  With the exception of emergency changes, there shall be an ample amount of time allowed for scrutiny before full implementation of the change is allowed.  Time shall be allowed for assessing impacts on safety and health, modifying procedures, and informing and training affected employees before the change is implemented.\n\n? Authorization Requirements for the Proposed Change:  Authorization shall be in writing and made by the person or persons in responsible charge of the operation of the chlorination process.\n\n6.0    Pre-startup Review\n\nThis element of the RMP exists to ensure that, before a new or modified process is brought on-line with chlorine, the process is thoroughly examined for safety, design integrity, and adequacy.  By implementing this procedure, facility personnel can prevent potentially dangerous \"makeshift\" modifications from being made and ensure that new or modified processes have been built in accordance with sound design and installation standards.\n\nThe pre-startup review will be performed for new and modified stationary sources as required.\n\nPrior Confirmation\n\n? Construction and equipment: This review is routinely performed for new construction performed by outside contractors as part of job completion verification and for the release of construction payments.  However, it is just as important to confirm compliance with design specifications and codes when the work has been performed by internal personnel.  \n    \n?

This plan is intended to be a \"living\" document that responds to changes in operations and personnel.  As such, it is necessary to check periodically to verify that (1) the plan still meets the needs of the facility, (2) the plan meets the requirements of the rules, and (3) that facility personnel are adhering to the plan.\n\nA compliance audit will be conducted at least every three years.  A more frequent audit schedule may be used at the discretion of the facility responsible person.  Factors influencing a more frequent schedule include:\n\n? high employee turnover\n? change in responsible person\n? frequent changes to process equipment or procedures.\n\nAlthough the rule states that the audit shall be conducted by at least one knowledgeable person, the level of effort required and amount of detail examined makes it more effective to conduct the audit with two or three personnel.  The audit team shall be familiar with: (1) the rule requirements, (2) the plan document, (3) the physical process, and (4) the covered chemical. \n\nThe audit report will take into account every requirement of the regulation, and will include findings and recommendations.  \n\nFindings resulting from the audit will be tracked and recommended actions to correct deficiencies or improve the RMP will be documented for completeness.

Likelihood and severity of the consequences\n? Safeguards in place to mitigate the consequences\n? Recommendations for change that would eliminate the hazard or minimize the chance of occurrence\n\nThe following pages provide details on PHA methodology and the related regulatory requirements.\n\nThe PHAs conducted for the chlorination processes at the City's wastewater treatment facility employed the \"What-if\" methodology.  This is a brainstorming approach in which facility and contract personnel, familiar with the operation and maintenance of the covered process, raise questions about operating deviations, mishaps, or human error.  The facilitator and participants ask questions such as:\n\n? What if a chlorine container is dropped during delivery?\n? What if the chlorine header is severed or ruptured?\n\nBased on the answers to these and similar questions developed by facility personnel, the consequences of the mishaps and the resulting recommendations for improvement are identified and documented.\n\nPHA Elements\n\nThe PHA elements consists of the following:\n\n? What-Ifs:  this is the event that triggers the release.  It may be that none of these events has ever occurred at a particular site.  However, if they can occur, they are listed and analyzed here.\n\n? Hazards:  this is the hazard directly attributed to the what-if event.  It is typically the release of the covered chemical.  \n\n? Consequences:  this is the result of the hazard.  Normally it is the exposure of employees to the chemical, but can "

There may be unforeseen results from a chemical release, despite the best efforts of the PHA team to identify all of them.\n\n? S (everity), L (ikelihood) , R(isk) R(anking):  these parameters are given numerical values based on the experience and knowledge of the PHA team.  Severity is rated from 1, where a fatality is the potential result, to 5, where the concentration of chemical in the air is simply detectable.  Likelihood ranges from 1, meaning the frequency of occurrence could be more than once per year to 5, meaning the occurrence is not expected to be more than once during the life of the facility or process.  The risk ranking is a composite of the severity and likelihood with 1 being an occurrence of greatest concern and 10 and occurrence of little concern.\n\n? Safeguards:  these are the facilities, equipment, procedures, design, alarms, etc. that prevent the consequences or minimize their effects.  These safeguards are already in place at the process and operational.\n\n? Recommendations:  these are considerations for improvement to existing safeguards or development of new safeguards.

A copy of this procedure is presented as Attachment E.\n\n14.0    Outside Agency Coordination\n\nSection (c) of 40 CFR 68.95 requires that the Emergency Response Plan be coordinated with community emergency response agencies such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC).  The City of El Mirage has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the City of Phoenix Fire Department to provide emergency HAZ MAT response to its Wastewater Treatment Facility.  A copy of the City of Phoenix Fire Department SOP's are presented in Attachment F.\n\n\n15.0    Hazard Assessment \n\nThe hazard assessment requirement of the RMP focuses on offsite consequences and impacts resulting from the accidental release of regulated substances within an affected facility. The hazard assessment is comprised of the following five elements:\n\n\n? Worst-case release scenario analysis\n? Alternative release scenario analysis\n? Defining of offsite impacts on population\n? Defining of offsite impacts on environmental receptors\n? Five-year accident history\n\n16.0    Worst-Case Releases Scenario\n\nThe parameters for the worst-case release scenario are specifically set by the RMP rule in Sections 68.22 and 68.25.  The worst-case release quantity (2000 pounds) is equal to the greatest amount of chemical held in a vessel or the greatest amount held in a pipe. \n\nThe worst-case quantity (2000 pounds) is assumed to be released over a ten minute time period.  This assumption applies to the chlorine at the site.  \n\nThere is no need to explain how a worst-case release might occur; cause is not an issue.  The rulemakers recognize that such a release is extremely unlikely to occur. Likewise, the meteorological conditions that must be assumed for a worst-case analysis are very unlikely to occur simultaneously.  These include a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, an atmospheric stability class of 'F', and the highest daily maximum temperature in the previous three years.  EPA's "

      "SummaryText": "RMP Guidelines for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables and Equations were used instead of computer modeling for this determination.\n\n17.0    Alternative Releases Scenario\n\nThe parameters for the alternative release scenarios are described in Sections 68.22 and 68.28 of the RMP rule.  The analysis of alternative releases allows for more realistic scenarios and more likely weather conditions.  For this analysis, the City selected a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  The release scenarios were potential scenarios identified during the PHA.\n\nThe provisions cited EPA RMP Guidelines for Wastewater Treatment Plant Tables and Equations was used instead of computer modeling to determine the Alternative Release data.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.0    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) involves determining a radius of influence for an accidental release, which is based on the distance to endpoint of the regulated substance.  The distance to endpoint for both the worse and alternative cases were established from the referenced EPA RMP Guideline document.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for this facility is described below.\n\nWorse-Case Release Scenario-Chlorine\n? Scenario:  Contents of full 1-ton cylinder released.\n? Parameters:\n-    Contents released in 10 minutes.\n-    Release is outside with no containment.\n? Results:   3 mile distance to endpoint.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario-Chlorine \n? Scenario:  Valve break from cylinder.  \n? Parameters:\n-    Leak of vapor chlorine blows for 60 minutes before it is controlled.\n-    Line diameter is 3/16  inch.\n-    Surroundings are rural.\n? Results:  0.1 mile distance to endpoint.\n\nMaps illustrating the site and assorted scenarios are presented in Attachment G.\n\n19.0    Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of controlled chemicals, within the last five years, that meet the criteria of the regulation."
