The WWTP, located at the end of O=Brien Lane in Conewego Township, processes up to 4.5 million gallons per day of wastewater and discharges to the South Branch Conewego Creek under NPDES Permit No. PA0026875.   Wastewater treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, primary sedimentation, secondary activated sludge treatment, clarification, filtration, disinfection, and de-chlorination.  Solid material removed from this process is stabilized in anaerobic digesters, dewatered, and utilized for agricultural purposes through land application.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe WWTP includes a disinfection system comprised of a chlorine container room, which contains two (2) one ton containers of chlorine liquefied under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  Up to six (6) one ton containers may be on site simultaneously.  The chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the storage containers through vacuum regulators and dissolves this gas in water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria and micro-organisms in the treated wastewater effluent prior to its discharge into the creek. Treatment plant operators regularly check the chlorinator room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory for planning purposes is 12,000 pounds.\n\n               To improve the water quality of the effluent discharged to the receiving stream, the WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide gas, another regulated substance, to de-chlorinate its effluent through a process called ?sulfonation?.  The sul"

      "SummaryText": "fonator is similar to the chlorinator and injects sulfur dioxide gas into wastewater to remove excess chlorine.\n\nThe Hanover WWTP=s accidental release prevention program is based upon the following elements:\n\n1.    High level of training for the operators;\n\n2.    Preventative maintenance program for equipment;\n\n3.    Use of state of the art process and safety equipment;\n\n4.    Use of accurate and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n\n5.    Performance of a Hazard Review of the equipment and procedures; and\n\n6.    Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA,) awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of a chlorine gas detector.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five (5) years.\n\n    The facility has an emergency response program which has been reviewed and coordinated by the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Gettysburg.  The operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated on an annual basis by the Adams County LEPC.  The Adams County Defensive Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team is the designated first-responder in the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak incident.  This HAZMAT team, however, is trained only at the Technician Level but is not State Certified; they can provide limited support for leak containment.  Under a mutual aid agreement between Adams County and Cumberland County, the Cumberland County Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Response Team will provide additional support for chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak repair.  This HAZMAT team is state certified and undergoes extensive training in dealing with a variety of hazardous material incidents, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas leaks.  \n\nRecommendations to improve safety were made following a June 1, 2004 inspection of the disinfection and"
