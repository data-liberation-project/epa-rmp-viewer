The Risk Management Program (RMP) meets and addresses the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency evacuation policies at the stationary source;\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled;\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario;\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps;\nThe five-year accident history;\nThe emergency evacuation program; and \nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release prevention and emergency evacuation, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency evacuation procedures.  The local Fire Department and Hazmat Team have been educated on our systems and are prepared to handle any accidental releases that may occur.  Refresher training and emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are trained to quickly and safely evacuate the plant.  BPI is committed to maintaining a Preventative Maintenance Program for our Ammonia handling equipment.  \n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Beef Products Inc. (BPI) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish training for both operators and Master Control.  As a demonstration of the BPI\u00bfs high degree of commitment to public safety and service, BPI is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing"

      "SummaryText": "recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.  BPI has developed a Master Control System utilizing PLC controls that allow us to continually monitor, react and control our refrigeration system from a remote location.  Any improvement modifications are applied in all BPI facilities when applicable.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the BPI facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system. In addition, anhydrous ammonia, converted to ammonia hydroxide, is used as a processing aid in the production of beef products at the facility.  This use, generally regarded as safe by the FDA, is an approved antimicrobial treatment by the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service.\n\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200ppm.  The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and majority of the piping are inside the facility\u00bfs building.\n\nAccident history investigations and reports are completed and fully documented for this facility.\n\nBeef Products Inc. will incorporate or address any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Off-site Consequences, incident investigations and program audits.  The flexibility of the program allows BPI to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing BPI employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
