The Santa Maria Facility handles hazardous materials onsite, and recognizes a responsibility to safely operate the facility in order to protect the employees, surrounding community, and the environment.  The Facility has taken a proactive stance to promote the overall safe operation of the processes, with programs to prevent accidents from occurring, planning for emergencies, and maintaining the equipment needed if an emergency does occur.  The RMP formalizes existing programs and procedures so that these programs may be reviewed more efficiently.\n\n\n\nThe Santa Maria Facility processes crude oil into intermediate products for further processing at other locations to produce gasoline.  The Facility receives crude oil from many sources via pipeline, stores it in tanks onsite, and processes the crude oil into products to be shipped elsewhere by pipeline, railcar, and truck.  The refining process separates the crude oil into four products: gas oil, naphtha (pressure distillate), sulfur, and coke (solid carbon based material).  The sulfur is generated because oil contains significant quantities of sulfur that must be removed to produce gasoline. The gas oil and naphtha products are also stored in the Facility's Storage Tanks prior to shipping by pipeline, while the solid sulfur and solid coke are shipped offsite by truck or railcar.   The Facility also has the utility and support systems required to provide for safe operation of the plant, including a power generation facility to make use of gas generated in the Refining Process.\n\n\n\nThe RMP effort at the Facility was divided into three phases.

Phase III of the RMP contains our Executive Summary of the overall RMP effort at the Facility, a synopsis of the Prevention Program, and a description of the Management Systems in place to implement and maintain the Facility's risk management measures. The Executive Summary and Data Elements are submitted to the Federal EPA, the State of California, and the County of San Luis as part of its Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Santa Maria Facility Refining & Offplot Units are covered by EPA RMP with the Regulated Substance Class of Flammables over the TQ at Program Level 1.\n\n\n\n    \n\nAccident & Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident & Release Prevention Program in place at the Santa Maria Facility.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a Management of Change Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. The Santa Maria Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use, and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Quality Assurance is determined as part of the Management of Change Program.

These safe work practices and procedures, along with training of affected personnel and Contractors, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.   Examples of standard safe work practices at the Santa Maria Facility include:\n\n\n\n?    Tracking and control of the entry/presence/exit of employees and contractors into and out of the Facility\n\n?    A hazardous energy procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance (i.e., Lock/Tag/Try)\n\n?    A procedure for safe removal of hazardous material before process piping or equipment is opened\n\n?    A permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., Hot Work)\n\n?    A permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space \n\n\n\nIn addition to the Safe Work Practices outlined above, the Santa Maria Facility conducts regular Physical Conditions Audits to ensure compliance with Federal, State, local regulations, and Company loss control requirements.  The intent of the inspections is to:\n\n\n\n?    Determine the effectiveness of the Facility's loss control system\n\n?    Establish a level of compliance\n\n?    Identify hazards and substandard conditions/practices for correction\n\n?

The Management of Change procedure has been implemented in order to ensure that all installations and changes to equipment are made in a manner that ensures safety and operability.    Whenever equipment or installations are modified, new facilities are added, or process changes are necessary, a review by appropriate Engineering, Operations, Maintenance, Safety, and Environmental personnel is conducted.   For all changes, a Management of Change proposal is submitted for consideration through our KMS Resolution Tracker system. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other Facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to:\n\n\n\n?    Ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\n\n?    Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\n\n\n\nProjects proceed from the initial MOC proposal through a planned sequence of signoffs designed to ensure that all parties are aware of the changes being implemented.  Affected Process Safety Information, including chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, is updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  Prior to startup, the MOC procedure requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) described above.

The audit is typically broken down into three phases. Phase I involves a question and answer session with various Facility personnel to determine regulatory compliance.  Phase II involves performing spot verifications to confirm that programs meet the intent of the standards.  Phase III consists of a series of interview questions with various employee groups to gauge the effectiveness of the programs.
