Bama Pie (Bama Pie) facility abides by the emergency response procedures and policies detailed in the Bama Pie Safety Plan manual.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nBama Pie maintains an emergency response team whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Bama Foods, LTD. facility prepares frozen bakery products for distribution.  Prior to December 2003, the facility operated a small ammonia refrigeration system that was not applicable to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation.  The facility underwent a major expansion, and operations on the newly expanded system began in December 2003.  As a result of the expansion, the facility is required to comply with Program Level 3 of the EPA RMP.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.  The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressur"

      "SummaryText": "e (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 15.5\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nThe total ammonia inventory is 37,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Bama Pie to prevent the accidental release of ammonia at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that the Bama Pie employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refr"

      "SummaryText": "igeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection.  The facility will notify the Maintenance Manager in the event of a release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility?s accident history in the last five years (December 2003 ? December 2008) revealed that Bama Pie has had one release involving ammonia, the regulated substance.  The amount of ammonia released from the system was less than the reportable quantity of 100 pounds.  The facility conducted an incident investigation of the release, which occurred at 3:25 AM on April 30, 2006.  Prior to the incident, the facility had conducted a Management of Change (MOC) that involved tie-ins to the water chiller system.  The incident investigation showed that the system tie-ins were not thoroughly analyzed.  The line break procedure that was used as part of the MOC did not include the isolation of the -25?F suction line.  As a result, during the hot gas defrost cycle, pressure built up in the pipe and overpressurized conditions eventually caused a leak from the suction line.  An operator went on the facility rooftop to stop the release by shutting down the liquid supply valve to the -25?F system.  The exhaust fans were operating when the leak occurred, venting the ammonia vapor to the outside of the facility.  Due to the foggy weather at the time of the incident, the ammonia vapor that had vented off from the facility stayed near ground level elevation.  Thus, a security guard"

      "SummaryText": " from the neighboring University of Tulsa smelled the ammonia and notified the fire department.  An employee of the Bama Pie facility and a security guard from University of Tulsa were sent to the hospital for treatment of headaches, weakness, and nausea.  Mitigation measures that resulted from the investigation consisted of better in-depth review of future MOC procedures and improved emergency response coordination between the Bama Pie facility and the local fire department.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nBama Pie has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team that is trained to First Responder Technician Level on an annual basis.  All Emergency Response Team members are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBama Pie has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  A Compliance Audit was completed in November 12-16, 2007.  The initial Process Hazard Analysis was completed in November 21, 2003, and the PHA was revalidated on December 1, 2008. Recommendations were generated during the 2003 PHA session, 2008 revalidation study, and the 2007 Compliance Audit to improve safety at the facility.  These include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues.  Bama Pie is proceeding with the few remaining mitigation measures associated with these studies."
