This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it, until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances  \r\n\r\nThe Santa Ynez Unit - Las Flores Canyon Treating Plant, located about 17 miles west of Santa Barbara, California, consists of one Program Level 3 process that utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This facility could contain a regulated flammable mixture and a regulated toxic. Transportation of regulated substances into and out of the facility is handled via pipeline and truck.  Additional details are included in the other sections of this plan.\r\n\r\nThis facility is located in a vegetated canyon with undeveloped rural land extending beyond the canyon to the north, east and west.  A highway borders the canyon approximately 1.5 miles to the south.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results \r\n\r\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the USEPA, data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternate Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.

Processes at this facility regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) or incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at this facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety issues (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\n\r\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The OIMS contact at this facility is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.

This facility ensures processes are maintained within these limits using process controls/monitoring equipment, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, pressure relief valves).\r\n\r\nThis facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment.  This information includes the materials of construction, design pressure, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a PHA delta revalidation process, an industry-accepted hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the processes as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.  This process involves field level business teams, which include engineering, operations personnel, and management.  Operations personnel are also involved in the evaluation of resolution options.

This training and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training is documented.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThis facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are in place to help ensure contractors: perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in the workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow safety rules, and inform Las Flores Canyon facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to working in this facility which includes: process overview, information about safety and health hazards, applicable emergency action plan provisions, and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis (JSA) is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to maintenance/construction tasks.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.
