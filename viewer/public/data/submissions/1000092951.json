If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Huntington Fire Department and the Huntington County LEPC, as appropriate, through the 911 Service. The primary hospital response is provided through Parkview Huntington Hospital. The Facility is not currently designated a \"responding\" facility, however, the Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nBuckeye Development and Logistics, LLC - Huntington Terminal is a propane storage and distribution Terminal. The Risk Management Plan covers the propane storage and distribution process including three horizontal storage vessels, one underground cavern, propane loading stations, ethyl mercaptan odorant storage, and ancillary equipment. The three horizontal storage vessels will hold primarily a mixture of gasoline and propane (approximately 60% propane). This is used for the initial volume of pipeline receipts to prevent contamination and is reported conservatively as a Flammable mixture of 100% propane in this submittal.\n\n\n\nBuckeye Development and Logistics, LLC - Huntington Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D- Program Level 3). Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chem"

The Facility's Facility Response Plan is coordinated with the Huntington Fire Department and the Huntington County LEPC. The Huntington Fire Department is aware of the Facility's propane storage and distrubution process, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.\n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety. Also, Buckeye makes every effort to coordinate annually at minimum with the local responders."
