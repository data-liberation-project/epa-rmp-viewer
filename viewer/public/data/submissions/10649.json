Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n7 We installed a flare system that will burn off any hydrocarbon vapor when high pressure is encountered within the plant. \n \n7 We provided manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons (which are tested semiannually) at several locations within the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.  The ESD system will also isolate the facility from the incoming feed pipeline and outgoing product pipeline.   \n \n7 We installed gas detectors in the compressor room in order to detect flammable hydrocarbon vapors and alarm the control room.\n \n7 We provided dual seals on the booster pumps.\n \n7 We provided high pressure and low-flow shutdown switches on our product pipelin"

Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards for which we strive.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Stephens Gas Plant is one of many facilities operated by ONEOK.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing a 25,000,000 cubic feet per day cryogenic/turbo-expander/demethanizer process.  The demethanized residue gas is either sold to customers as low pressure gas or recompressed for sale to customers as high pressure gas.  There is a product surge tank with a maximum capacity of 7,943 gallons which contains demethanized product.  This demethanized product is the only flammable substance at the facility in an amount greater than threshold quantity that is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  There are no RMP-covered toxic substances present at the plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.    T"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the flammable mixture in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Stephens Gas Plant, this would involve our 7,943-gallon product surge tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.3 miles (approximately 1,600 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is EPA\u0012s threshold for measurable impacts.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, etc.) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite consequences is calculated to reach approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1,050 feet) from the release point.  This distance calculation is also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario.  We have selected the alternative release scenario based on a release from our demethanizer tower due to the relief valve sticking open.  We have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  These measures include the following:  1) We conduct regular visual inspections of all equipment at our fa"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n \n \nEmergency Response Program\n \nWe will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Stephens Gas Plant with the Velma Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Velma Police Department, the Stephens County Sheriff, Duncan Regional Hospital, the Velma Ambulance Service, and the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety.  The Stephens Gas Plant Operator is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  Our Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n \n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n \nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the Stephens Gas Plant.
