      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into a unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County Florida.  Department facilities adhere to policies and procedures of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Florida Department of Community Affairs and Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nLake Park Water Treatment Plant\n\nLake Park Water Treatment Plant is located at 17316 Dale Mabry Highway North, Tampa, FL. The plant is adjacent to Dale Mabry Highway.  A county park adjoins the plant property.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case scenario and alternative release.  The worst case scenario is defined by  the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes, due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst release scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario at Lake Park Water Plant involves an unspecified failure of a single one ton container of chlorine.  The toxic endpoint distance was obtained from the EPA lookup tables.  The EPA conditions asssume the release of the entire amount of product as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour ERPG-2 as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of offsite consequence analysis.  The Hillsborough County Water Department believes the EPA assumptions to be unrealistic because:\n\n     A.     Only a fraction os the compresed liquified chlorine released to th"

This results in the formation of a very dense chlorine cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a chlorine cloud of only chlorine gas.\n\n     B.     Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6 percent of the area of the full circle.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered at the Lake Park Water Plant include the use of the vacuum system for chemical feed  and chlorine leak detection equipment.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe general Water Department release prevention program is based on several key elements:\n\n     A.     High level of training of operators and maintenance staff\n     B.     An aggressive preventative maintenance program\n     C.     State of the art process and safety equipment\n     D.     Accurate, effective operating procedures\n     E.     Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     F.     An in-house inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention activities include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for use by the operations staff when connecting / disconnecting chlorine containers and an acute awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine gas.  The plant maintains an approved chlorine repair kit on site."
