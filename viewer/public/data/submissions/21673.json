THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nThe owner, management and employees of United Farmers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ahhydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the envirnoment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Propane is stored only for the purpose of facility grain drying.\n\n- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct applicatin for crop production nutrients.  Propane is received and stored for facility grain drying purposes.\n\n- The maazimum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 210,000 pounds in our 1-18,000 gallon tank and nurse tanks.  Th emaximum quantity of propane stored would be 70,000 pounds in our 1-18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\na.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 6.2 minutes for anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion to 200ppm is .94 miles.\n\nFor propane, the worst case scenario for ammonia is a 2 minute release from a 3\" pipe break resulting in a distance of .78 miles.\n\nFor propane, the alternative release scenario is a vapor cloud explosion causing a 1psi over pressure to a distance of (factor .67 x .35 miles = .24 miles) .24 miles.

In addition, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Ammonia Rules.  For propane, NFPA-58 Rules.\n\n5.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years.\n\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has:\n\na.  A written Emergency Action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.36;\n\nb.  Provided Sate and Local authorities the Emergency Planning and Community Rith-To-Know information as required under SARA Title II-EPCRA;\n\nc.  Coordinated with local emergency respondes.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSafety improvenent is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia or propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
