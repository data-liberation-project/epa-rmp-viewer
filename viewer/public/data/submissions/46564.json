The Plan provides the public with information about each covered process, our accident prevention programs and our emergency response planning efforts at the Muskegon mill.  S. D. Warren's complies with EPA's RMP Program.\n1.1.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (A)\nS. D. Warren's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach. It integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  Our prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) found in the 40 CFR-68, Prevention Program.\n1.1.1.    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (A)(1)\nS. D. Warren has a management system in place which oversees the implementation and ongoing use of the RMP elements.  The Managing Director is responsible for RMP implementation.  This program, along with other mill policies, eliminates and /or reduces the likelihood and consequences of a hazardous chemical release.\n1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3  (A)(2)\nS. D. Warren maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  The program is based on the EPA's Program Level 3 elements.  The RMP elements have been combined with like elements of the mill's OSHA PSM program. \n1.2.    S. D. WARREN STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING AT THE MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN SITE (b)\nThe mill employs approximately 258 full-time employees (including all medical or other laid off employees), some of whom operate the covered processes.  Today, bulk chlorine in one ton containers is only used as part of the water production operations.\n1.2.1.    SITE DESCRIPTION (b)(1)\nThe facility has chlorine storage at one location.  Chlorine from this system is used in the mill's water treatment plant. \nThe water treatment plant's only source of chlorine is from one-ton containers.  Two containers are connected to the water treatment evaporation system located in a raw water filter #57 building.  Up to eight"

The maximum inventory is 20,000 lbs. included in process and storage containers.\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include:  the eight each one-ton container in the storage area and the raw water filter building #57, which contains two one ton containers and all associated piping, vents and exhaust systems.  It also includes the service water pump building #56, feed and injection systems.\n1.2.2.    REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantities. \n1.3.    WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS ( c)\nThe worst case and alternate scenarios were evaluated using both EPA guidance and air dispersion modeling.  An off-site consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule to estimate potential impacts to the community.  As required by RMP, S. D. Warren's off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst case accidental release for chlorine and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\n1.4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)\nS. D. Warren's accidental release prevention program is based on OSHA's PSM program and EPA's RMP Level 3 prevention program.  The PSM program has been in place and effectively used for several years.  It is part of the standard operating procedure for the facility.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall site program.  The second is the chlorine specific actions within the site program.  These programs are coordinated with Muskegon Fire Department.\n1.4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d)(1)\nFacility-wide, elements of the prevention program are used for all operations.  The basic elements are described below: \n1.4.1.1.

Process Safety Information:  In accordance with applicable requirements, S. D. Warren has compiled and maintains process safety information about the design, installation, maintenance, and operations of its covered processes.  This ensures that information remains current.  Employees working in covered areas are trained in this information.  The employer should give overview training of this information.\n1.4.1.3.    Process Hazard Analysis.  S. D. Warren performed process hazard analyses (PHA) on its PSM/RMP covered processes.  The PHA is a key component of the process safety management system and S. D. Warren's RMP accident prevention program.  It is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential hazards posed by the covered processes   Specifically, the PHA addressed: \n    Hazards of the process;\n    Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases (e.g., process monitoring and control instrumentation with alarms);\n    Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls; \n    Facility siteing; \n    Human factors (human error); and \n    A qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on the employees in the work place.\n1.4.1.4.

Warren discontinued the use of three processes that contain regulated substances.   The first process that was shut down, isolated and decomissioned in July, 2001, was the chlorine railcar and evaporation system.   This reduced the maximum quantity in a single vessel from 180,000 pounds to 2,000 pounds.  Based on preliminary off site impact studies, the radius to the endpoint was reduced from 14 to 2 miles which reduced the area by a factor of 50. The number of homes and facilities impacted has been drastically reduced.  The second process, also decommissioned in July, 2001, was the original chlorine dioxide generation facility.  This reduced the total chemical inventory of chlorine dioxide by 2,500 pounds. And recently the pulp mill and bleach plant were shutdown, eliminating the chlorine di"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 68.155\nS. D. Warren Company operates a paper mill.  The mill is located at 2400 Lakeshore Drive, Muskegon, Michigan.  The Utility Department operates one process unit, which contains EPA listed highly hazardous chemicals over the regulated threshold.  Chlorine is used in the Utility Water Treatment Plant.\n\nS.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection, and emergency response programs.  Since 1980 we have developed many programs that eliminate or minimize the effects of an accidental release.  In 1992 the mill adopted the OSHA Process Management Program (PSM).  In 1999 the mill implemented the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP program).  In 2001 the mill installed and commissioned a new R-8, \"state of the art\", chlorine dioxide generation unit.  This permitted shutting down and decommissioning of two older RMP covered processes.  Both units had supplied the Pulp Mill Bleach Plant. The Pulp Mill Bleach Plant and associated R8 plant were shutdown on August 19, 2005. The remaining chlorine unit is the primary supply to the water treatment plant.  Removal of these three units reduced the worst case area and greatly reduced the potential impact. This has significantly improved the safety potential of the mill's operations.  All of this was accomplished in compliance with the RMP regulation.\n\nS. D. Warren 's Risk Management Program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA's\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found in 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One requirement of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) to the EPA whenever a unit is decommissioned.  This RMP Plan submi"
