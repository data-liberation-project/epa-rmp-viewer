Michael Angelo's Gourmet Foods manufacturers frozen foods and is equipped with a refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119, Process Safety Management. This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. The facility will contact the local fire department who in turn will notify the local Hazardous Materials Response Team to assist us in mitigating a significant ammonia release. Michael Angelo Gourmet Foods' team members are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in the actual response.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been one accidental release or reportable incident at this facility in over five years\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no planned changes to the system at this time.

We must do the items that follow to improve safety:\n\n1.To permit OSHA access to the workplace at issue here in subsequent to the date fixed for abatement for the specific and limited purpose of determining if the conditions described in the citations have been corrected.\n\n2.To continue to comply with the applicable provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the applicable safety and health standards promulgated pursuant to the Act.\n\n3.To enhance our safety and health management system through implementation of the following:\n\na.To train personnel at the site in the hazards and control methods addressed by the citations.\n\nb.To implement a self-inspection program for periodic, unannounced inspections of its workplace \n\nc.To enlist the assistance of qualified contractors to evaluate and report on the current condition of process safety management at the facility. Michael Angelo's will seek assistance in the areas of process hazard analysis, facility siting, mechanical integrity, and operating procedures. \n\nd. To complete these efforts and report to OSHA Austin Area Office a completed third party compliance audit report with actions items and intended completion dates within 12 months or NLT January 2015.\n\n"
