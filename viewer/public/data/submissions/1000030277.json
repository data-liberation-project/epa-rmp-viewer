This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention as evidenced in the training programs and in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  It is the policy of SESA to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nShin-Etsu Silicones of America (SESA) manufactures carbon functional silane compounds.  Per 40 CFR ?68.115 a threshold quantity of a regulated substance listed in ?68.130 is present at a stationary source if the total quantity of the regulated substance contained in a process exceeds the threshold.  The following table lists the ?68.130 toxic and flammable chemicals that may be onsite and an estimate of the amount of the chemicals onsite at any given time.\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical/Type    40 CFR 68 Threshold Quantity(lbs)    Estimated Onsite Quantities (lbs)    PSM Status (40 CFR 1910.119)\n\nTrichlorosilane/Flammable    10,000                            576,000                     Applicable (Listed Chemical)\n\nAcrylonitrile/Toxic          20,000                             81,000                     Applicable (Flammable)\n\nHydrogen Sulfide/Toxic       10,000                             12,100                     Applicable (Listed Chemical)\n\nPropylene Oxide/Toxic        10,000                             62,300                     Applicable (Flammable)\n\n\n\nBased on this information the regulated substances under the RMP are trichlorosilane, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and hydrogen sulfide.  There are no other toxic or flammable materials on-site which exceed RMP threshold levels.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 the offsite consequence analysis must include the worst-case release quantity which is d"

Acrylonitrile\n\n\n\nAcrylonitrile is normally liquid at ambient temperature.  SESA assumed that the quantity in the largest storage vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The largest volume of acrylonitrile is in a horizontal storage vessel (TK-1003) placed in a concrete containment system with a floor area measuring 14? 4? by 49.5?.  The containment floor surface area is 709.5 sq. ft.  A spill of the entire tank (12,000 gallons) is equivalent to 1,604 cubic feet.  The resulting liquid depth would be 2.26 feet (27.13 inches).\n\n\n\nThe rate of release to the air was determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. SESA used RMP*Comp which calculates the volatilization rates and toxic endpoint distance.  The volatilization rate was based on 100F.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 1.2 miles. Based on this impact distance and the proximity of off-site receptors this is classified as a Program Level 3 release. \n\n\n\nB.

The largest volume of propylene oxide is in a horizontal storage vessel (TK-1005) placed in a concrete containment system with a floor area measuring 17? by 49.5?.  The containment floor surface area is approximately 841.5 sq. ft.  A spill of the entire tank (9,000 gallons) is equivalent to 1,203 cubic feet.  The resulting liquid depth would be 1.430 feet (17.16 inches).\n\n\n\nThe rate of release to the air was determined from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. SESA used RMP*Comp which calculates the volatilization rates and toxic endpoint distance.  The volatilization rate was based on 100F.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 0.7 miles. Based on this impact distance and the proximity of off-site receptors this is classified as a Program Level 3 release. \n\n\n\nC.    Trichlorosilane\n\n\n\nTrichlorosilane is normally liquid at ambient temperature.  SESA assumed that the quantity in the largest storage vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  The largest volume of trichlorosilane is in a horizontal storage vessel (TK-1054) placed in a concrete containment system with a floor area measuring 37? by 71?.  The containment floor surface area is approximately 2,627 sq. ft.  A spill of the entire tank (40,000 gallons) is equivalent to 5,347 cubic feet.  The resulting liquid depth would be 2.035 feet (24.42 inches).\n\n\n\nSESA assumed that the worst-case release quantity of trichlorosilane vaporizes resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion was used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Trichlorosilane is normally liquid at ambient temperature and it was assumed that the entire quantity in the storage vessel is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.  SESA assumed that the quantity of trichlorosilane that becomes vapor in the first 10 minutes is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.  SESA used RMP*"

Hydrogen Sulfide\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of hydrogen sulfide is the rupture of a single storage cylinder.  Based on guidance from the EPA the WCS involves the complete inventory of the cylinder released over a 10-minute period.  The capacity of the cylinder is 1,050 lb.  The WCS is modeled based on a release rate of 110.0 lbs/min.  The EPA's RMP*Comp model indicates that the endpoint for this type of release is 2.2 miles.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific personnel within SESA are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/-exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nSESA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with"

      "SummaryText": " the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSESA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSESA maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) startup after an emergency shutdown, (7) operating limits, and (8) safety and health considerations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, SESA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the anhydrous ammonia process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators receive refresher training at least once every three years on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nSESA uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, SESA evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSESA has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) performing and documenting inspections and results, (2) conducting maintenance training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.

The hot work permit and procedures are designed to control spark-producing activities and to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before work begins in the hazardous area.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nSESA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the facility processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.
