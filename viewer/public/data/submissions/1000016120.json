Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to one of  two pumped liquid recirculators located in the engine room.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the accumulator and the suction gas is piped to the screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to a thermosyphon vessel  and from the thermosyphon vessel it returns to the high pressure receiver. High pressure liquid  from the thermosyphon vessel is supplied to the oil coolers on each screw compressor. High temperature liquid is evaporated in the oil cooler and a combination of high temperature gas and liquid is returned to the thermosyphon vessel by thermosyphon action. Excess liquid from the liquid recirculators is pumped to a tranfer vessel where the liquid tranfers into the high pressue receiver by gravity.   \n\nThe Kill Floor, Offal rooms, and two Chill Coolers were new facilities built from 1999 to 2001.

This program has been prepared to address the risks involved with the presence of anhydrous ammonia in an amount in excess of 10,000 lbs., which is contained in our refrigeration system. \n\nOur program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general Beef Packers, Inc. business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.\tDESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Beef Packers, Inc. facility is a commercial beef slaughter house and processing facility.  The main facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to the Kill Floor area, Offal Storage rooms, Chill Coolers and Boning Rooms. The Kill Floor  is cooled by two packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units. There are four Carcas Coolers and two Offal Storage rooms that are cooled by ceiling mounted fan coil units.  There are five Boning Rooms that are cooled by a combination of three packaged roof mounted ACUair blower coil units and ceiling mounted fan coil units.  A computer system provides su"

The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00c2\u00bfdump box\u00c2\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n    \nThe ammonia system at the main facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the main facility is treated as a single process.\n\nWest Coast Grinding is a beef grinding and packaging facility located on the Beef Packers, Inc. property.  This is a separate facility with a dedicated ammonia system that provides cooling to a single grinding room.  A ground mounted ACUair unit provides room cooling.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability. \n\nHigh pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid recirculator through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves and expansions valves.

In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia through the course of our normal safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nBeef Packers, Inc. has not had any accidental releases in the last five (5) years.\n\n5.\tEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, \u00c2\u00bfEmergency Action Plans.\u00c2\u00bf  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, \u00c2\u00bfHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,\u00c2\u00bf and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \n\nStrategically, we will respond \u00c2\u00bfminimally\u00c2\u00bf to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done by the local fire department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nAt least once each year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Beef Packers, Inc. continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for impr"

      "SummaryText": "oved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Beef Packers, Inc. business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Beef Packers, Inc. now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a \u00c2\u00bfliving document\u00c2\u00bf.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Beef Packers, Inc. employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the Risk & Process Safety Management Program Beef Packers, Inc. will continue to profit while maintaining overall plant, worker and public safety."

      "SummaryText": "ensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver. Excess liquid from the liquid recirculator is pumped to a tranfer vessel where the liquid tranfers into the high pressue receiver by gravity.\n\nThe West Coast Grinding facility is a new facility built in 2004.  This area is served by a new ammonia refrigeration system designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a water diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located in the grinding room, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \u00c2\u00bfdump box\u00c2\u00bf contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n    \nThe ammonia system at the Grinding facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the Grinding facility is treated as a single process.\n   \n3.\tGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Beef Packers, Inc. facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The systems contain a total charge of approximately 30,000 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that all employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of"
