Lake Charles Chemical Complex\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPA's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPA's threshold quantity are Chlorine, Ethylene Oxide and Hydrogen Fluoride. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by "

For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated with the process unit fo"

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers' work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At the Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC), operating procedures: (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n\n?    Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n?    Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n\n?    Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment required and steps to take if exposed to a particular chemical.\n\n\n\nPlant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operation, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\n\n\nAll new employees assigned as operators receive comprehensive training before being assigned to a specific operating unit. This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, and detailed review of complex "

Once a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures and for specific tasks, before he is allowed to begin work in a specific operating unit.\n\n\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process. The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training. Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOCA)\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change program for the LCCC evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program. All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a  confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented. The LCCC trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. The investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. Depending on the incident, an investigation team may be formed. Results of the investigation are documented and appropriate changes are made.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) maintains a written employee participation program to help ensure that safety and environmental concerns of the plant workers are addressed.
