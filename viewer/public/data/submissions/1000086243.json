Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: The owners, management, and employees of Hub City, LLC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The facility also has prepared an Emergency Action Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation.\r\n\r\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at Hub City, LLC is the production of ethanol from corn. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored, and used in the ethanol production process as a buffer and nitrogen source during the fermentation process. The facility also uses natural gasoline as a denaturant for the final product. The natural gasoline is a flammable mixture that contains pentane among other ingredients.\r\n\r\n3.
