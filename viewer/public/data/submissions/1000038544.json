The rupture of one tank was identified to be the worst-case release scenario since it will result the largest spill surface area. For the worst-case release scenario, the maximum distance to the level of concern is 0.30 miles. Details on the hazard assessment are provided in Section 2.\r\n\r\n1.4. RECEPTORS IMPACTED\r\n\r\nOnce the impact distance of the worst-case release scenario is examined, the impact on off-site receptors must be considered. If public receptors   or environmental receptors   are impacted, additional analysis is required. The distance from the storage tanks to the fence line is approximately 290 ft. (0.05 miles). Therefore, the level of concern (0.30 miles) extends past the fence line to off-site locations, and any unrestricted areas within this region must be evaluated to determine if public or environmental receptors are impacted. There are no environmental receptors within the impact radius. Details on the receptors impacted are provided in Section 2.5.\r\n\r\n1.5. ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere are no accidents to report for either the five year accident history (40 CFR \u00a768.42) or for determining Program 1 applicability (40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(1)).\r\n\r\n1.6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\nA facility emergency response plan for the KKGP facility is in place and has been coordinated with local emergency planning and response organizations as required by 40 CFR \u00a768.10(b)(3).  Specifically, this plan has been coordinated with the City of Bowie Fire Department.\r\n\r\n1.7. PROGRAM LEVEL\r\n\r\nFlammable substance storage at the KKGP facility qualifies as a Program 3 process since, based on the offsite consequence analysis, the maximum distance to the level of concern impacts public receptors and the process is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard (29 CFR \u00a71910.19).  \r\n\r\n1.8.

For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\nThe definition of process is broad and can be interpreted"

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPecan Pipeline owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located in Montague County, Bowie City, Texas, herein referred to as Kripple Kreek Gas Plant (KKGP).  Pecan Pipeline is a wholly owned subsidiary of EOG Resources, Inc.  The current Risk Management Plan (RMP) was resisted on January 23, 2009 and submitted as Pecan Pipeline. This report provides the supporting documentation for the 5 year RMP renewal submittal. \r\n\r\nThe Kripple Kreek Gas Plant (KKGP), KKGP facility is a natural gas processing facility which includes fixed and skid mounted natural gas processing equipment and natural gas liquids storage tanks.  The plant contains several regulated flammable substances including: propane, butane, ethane, methane, pentane, isobutene [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Isopentane [Propane, 2-methyl-]. These substances are listed in Tables 3-4  of the 40 CFR 68.130.  This installation does not have any regulated toxic substances with an amount greater than the threshold quantity specified in 40 CFR 68.130 .\r\n\r\nSince this plant is dedicated to manufacture several products related to natural gas, it has several storage tanks that are used for the abovementioned products.  The largest tank in this facility, the one that constitutes the worst case scenario for the release of flammable substances that could cause a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), has a capacity of 75,331 pounds of a hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases.  This tank is identified as Product Surge Tank and it is located in the process area.  The following flammable substances, and their concentrations {lbs.}, are present in this mixture: ethane {34,857 lbs, 45.21%}, propane {26,666 lbs, 34.58%}, butane {7,924 lbs, 10.28%}, and traces of isobutene, isopentene, hexane, methane and pentane.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require facilities that produ"

      "SummaryText": "ce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially required to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most recently in 2004. Flammable substances are regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMPs must be prepared for processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130.  The threshold for the gases that compose the hydrocarbon - flammable mixture of gases are the following: propane {10,000 lbs} and ethane {10,000 lbs}. Based on the above threshold quantities, only these two flammables substances are subjected to comply with the requirements of the Chemical Accident Prevention rule and must prepare an RMP. \r\n\r\n1.2. RMP REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nAll facilities subject to the RMP rule must complete a hazard assessment analysis for the regulated chemical. In addition, the recent (5-year) accident history and emergency response plan must be reviewed. Based on these assessments, the facility will be classified within one of three program levels.\r\n\r\n>\tProgram 1 - no offsite receptor impacted (potentially and in last five years)\r\n>\tProgram 2 - offsite impacts and not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management Standard (OSHA PSM)\r\n>\tProgram 3 - offsite impacts and subject to OSHA PSM    \r\n\r\nAll programs require submittal of an RMP. For Program 2 and 3 processes, two additional tasks are required: a release prevention program and an emergency response program.

Due to the arrangement of these tanks, each tank is being considered for this plan as an individual process unit.  EOG needs to confirm the above.\r\n\r\n2.1.1. PRODUCT SURGE TANK\r\n\r\nThe Product Surge Tank is the largest process units at the site with a capacity of 77,109 pounds.  Although this tank has a capacity of approximately 35,000 us gallons it has been operationally constrained to operate at only 45% of its capacity, at just 15,750 pounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.2. METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe meteorological parameters for the worst case scenario are defined by 40 CFR \u00a768.22(b) as having a wind speed of 1.5 m/s and the atmospheric stability Class F. Per 40 CFR \u00a768.22(c), the highest daily maximum temperature for the past three years are used.

SOURCE EVAPORATION RATES\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis contains assumptions for both the release rate and distance to endpoint calculations for a toxic liquid release.  The release rate was calculated using the method in the OCA Guidance, but since the OCA guidance tables and numbers are not updated, RMP*Comp was used for the hazard assessment analysis.    \r\n\r\n2.4. DISPERSION MODELING ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe dispersion modeling analysis for accidental flammable mixture release into the ambient air is evaluated with the RMP*Comp program (Version 2.01).

OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\nAfter the distance to the toxic endpoint has been determined, the offsite impacts on population, public receptors, and environmental receptors should be analyzed as required by the RMP rule. The population within a circle centered at the point of release and a radius equal to the distance to the toxic endpoint should be estimated to two significant digits. In addition, all types of public receptors (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas or arenas, major commercial or industrial areas) and environmental receptors (national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges; federal wilderness areas) within this distance should be identified.\r\n\r\nMARPLOT (Mapping Applications for Response, Planning, and Local Operational Tasks, Version 4.3.2) was used to estimate the potentially affected population within the distance to the toxic endpoint and to identify public receptors. MARPLOT provides databases from the Bureau of Census, and other federal agencies. The demographic information in MARPLOT is based on the 2010 Census.\r\n\r\nMARPLOT indicates that for an area 1 miles from the worst-case release source the following: No population records found for the selected area. Although the impact radius for which the OCA needs to be perform is of 0.6 miles in the best interest to do not consider the distance between the sources and the property fence the a radius of 1 miles was used instead.  The impact area on a MARPLOT map is demonstrated in Figure 1 in appendix D. Google Earth (Version 7.1.1) was used to find the public receptors within the impact radius for the worst case scenario.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO RELEASE ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nEOG Resources operates a refrigeration systems that has a propane accumulator tank with an approximate capacity of 12,012 gallons of propane.  Since this tank uses 100% Propane it was assumed a rupture in the tank shell that caused an opening of approximately one (1) square inch at the bottom of the tank.  To make conditions worst, it was assumed that orifice is located at the bottom of the tank and that it has a liquid column of 21.5 feet above the opening under discussion.\r\n\r\nThis alternative scenario was evaluated using the dispersion modeling analysis RMP*Comp program (Version 2.01 to determine the distance to the overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch is reached for this substance as specified under the RMP Rule.  For the above scenario, this distance is less than 0.1 miles (< 1.6 kilometers).\r\n\r\n \r\n3. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENTAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nPer the requirements of the RMP rule, KKGP must include a five-year accident history in the Risk Management Plan. The five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of one or more of the regulated substances from a covered process in the five years prior to the submission of the Risk Management Plan. To be reportable, the release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tOn-s"
