Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\n\r\nThis it to inform all interested persons, including employees, that The Pictsweet Company is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to manage the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to minimize the occurrence and consequences of significant releases of toxic substances, as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling or the onsite movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release are considered a single process.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern individual processes, activities or equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the facility consists of various pumps, vessels, compressors and condensers that are used to change the state of ammonia from a gas to a liquid and these components make up a closed system.  The system operation is very similar to the operation of a household refrigerator.  The total ammonia inventory o"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as required and they comply with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nTraining\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nHot Work Permit\r\nManagement of Change\r\nPre-startup Safety Review\r\nContractor Qualifications and Safety Programs\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\n\r\nD. Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere was a reportable ammonia release of 415 pounds on July 30, 2015. However, there were no injuries or property damage involved with the release. \r\n\r\n\r\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Bridgeville Plant's emergency response program is based on OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Sussex County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Bridgeville Fire Department.\r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility's RMP and PSM programs are works in progress and are constantly being reviewed and revised.  Operating procedures and PHA's are reviewed periodically.  Incident investigations are initiated following any event that did or could have resulted in a release of chemical and any recommendations made by that investigation are then accomplished without delay.  The PSM and RMP programs are audited by both internal and external teams.  The findings of such audits are then expeditiously addressed.  In order to stay abreast of the most current a"
