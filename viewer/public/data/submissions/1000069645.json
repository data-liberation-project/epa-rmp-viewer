This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Mandan Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Mandan Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Mandan Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Mitigation system on the Alky Unit that includes hydrogen fluoride detectors with alarms.\n\n3.    Area Ammonia detectors on the ASD Unit\n\n4.    H2S detectors and alarms on several of the refinery operating units\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Scrubber to minimize air emissions\n\n3. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., hig"

We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The Mandan Refinery has not had any incidents covered by the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Mandan Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the Mandan refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emerg"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Personnel are trained on or informed of all changes to the refinery emergency response program that affect them.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mandan Refinery is coordinated with the Morton County and Burleigh County Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Mandan Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Mandan Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\n \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Mandan Refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. The following types of changes are planned:\n\n\n\n1.    Refinery Safety Instrumented System (SIS) Upgrades at additional process units. \n\n2.    Upgrades to critical instrumented systems have been completed in approximately half of the refinery; analysis is ongoing to identify and correct any performance gaps.  (This is an ongoing continuous improvement activity)\n\n3.    Establish Integrity Operating Windows for all process units \n\n4.    Replace obsolete pneumatic field instrumentation with electronic devices\n\n5.    Upgrade/replace the 25-30 yea"
