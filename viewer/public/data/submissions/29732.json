Montell's Policy Statement on Health, safety, and Environment,reads, The Company shall manage activities in such a way as to take foremost account of:\n- the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers and the public.\n- protection of the environment.\n- avoiding damage to property.\nIt shall adhere to the principles and the recommendations of the \"Responsible Care\" program of the chemical Industry.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nMontell USA, Inc. - Bayport Facility, was originally constrcuted in the early 1970's.  At the time a single polypropylene (plastics) manufacturing unit was built and was owned & operated by Hercules Incorporated.  In 1983 hercules merged its plastics business with Montedison of Milan, Italy to form Himont.  In 1995 Montell was formed by a merger between Himont and Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.

The Montell Bayport plant employs about 200 people, and currently consists of 4 polypropylene production units capable of producing 1.81 billion pounds of polymers a year.  The plant property is aproximately 213 acres, 165 of which is used for the manufacturing activites.\nMontell Polyolefins is a worldwide organization dedicated to the development, manufacturing, & marketing of a diverse range of polyolefins.  Olefins are hydrocarbons produced by the oil refining industry, such as propylene, butene, propane, and ethylene.  Polymer is manufactured by a catalytic polymerization processes (Spheripol and Catalloy), and polypropylene is formed (plastics).  These hydrocarbons (olefins) are present at our site in excess of 10,000 pounds each at any one time.  Polymer is produced (a hard solid material) in the shape of flake or pellets, and is the raw material for other companies manufacturing activities such as:  Vehicle bumpers, Home sidings, Medical syringes that administer life-saving medication, Shatter-proof packaging that's safe for children, Bicycle helmets, Food platic wrap & containers, Baby pampers, Yarn for clothes & carpets, in addition to Tools.   \n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (both cases DID not assume any of the active or passive safety prevention systems to be working, which is unrealistic).\nOur WORST-CASE scenario is failure of one of the three propylene storage tanks and release of its entire contents (390,000 pounds), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The maximum distance to endpoint is less than 1 mile (0.59 mile).  Since our facility is located in an industrial area, not occupied by housing-schools-or shopping centers,  this scenario will not impact the community and will not have any mentionable affect on industrial receptors.  \nOur ALTERNATIVE-CASE scenario is failure of a propylene feed tank & release of its entire contents, 47,000 pounds. resulting in a vapo"
