      "SummaryText": "The Facility Policy-The employees of Ag Wise, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release shouls occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire department and others involved to insure proper steps are taken to get the problem solved.\nFacility Information-The primary activity at our facility is the storage and blending of both dry and liquid fertilizers for sale to area farmers.  Anhyrdrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity .  The distance to the endpoint is 5 miles.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is 5 miles.\nThe Five Year Accident History-There have been no accidnetal releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant propery damage at the facility.\nThe Emergency Response Program-The facility has a written emergency action plan through the company of Regulatory Consultants Inc.  Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluation and training progams are performed to insure safe condition.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implemention at this time"
