Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-CalARP program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Mar Vista Resources has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-CalARP related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Mar Vista Resources, Risk Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Mar Vista Resources has updated their unified RMP-CalARP Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name                              | Process Chemical                   | Process Quantity\n\n24.5% Aqueous Ammonia Blending Process      24.5% Aqueous Ammonia                220,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur RMP-CalARP program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program to meet CalARP and RMP obligations\n\n2. Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general business practices\n\n3.

The facility utilizes 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution for manufacturing various nitrogenous fertilizers. \n\n\n\n24.5% aqueous ammonia solution is stored within two (2) 15,000 gallon double wall steel tanks. As required, 24.5% aqueous ammonia is pumped through fused polyethylene pipes into Mixer 5 and Mixer 6 where it is blended with other products to generate the desired fertilizer blend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process at Mar Vista Resources consists of tanks, mixers, pumps, and valves which are interconnected by piping.\n\n \n\nThe process is not subject to California or Federal OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation because the solution concentrations is less than the concentrations listed in the PSM regulation:\n\n\n\nThe 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution process exceeds the USEPA Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity (20,000 lbs for ammonia solutions >20%). In the USEPA RMP Regulation, Table 1 to ?68.130 lists two different thresholds for ammonia: (1) Ammonia (anhydrous) over 10,000 lbs. and (2) Ammonia (concentration 20% or greater) over 20,000 lbs. Due to this distinction, when determining applicability for the USEPA RMP, the aqueous ammonia solution is calculated based on the total weight of the aqueous ammonia solution, rather than extracting the weight of the ammonia from the aqueous ammonia solution.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the mass of ammonia within the solution exceeds the threshold quantity for the CalARP regulation (500 lbs).\n\n\n\nRAGAGEP Statement\n\nIt is unknown which codes and standards were followed in the design and construction of the 24.5% aqueous ammonia solution process at Mar Vista Resources.
