      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nn-Pentane is used as a raw material in the manufacturing of expandable polystyrene at Dart Polymers, Inc.'s Owensboro, Kentucky facility.  n-Pentane is listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) as a regulated substance and therefore is subject to the regulations and their requirements.  The same properties that make n-pentane valuable as a raw material to our process make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while handling it in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to health and safety of the workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  Dart Polymers' accidental release prevention includes the observation and practice of all Federal and State rules and regulations applicable to n-pentane.  Safety depends on the manner in which n-pentane is handled, training of personnel in safe handling procedures, and on the safety devices inherent in the design of the Dart Polymers facility.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.\n\nThe emergency response policy of Dart Polymers at the Owensboro facility is based upon the safety of the employees and the community.  \n\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nThe primary products of the Dart Polymers facility are polystyrene resins and expandable polystyrene.  n-Pentane, a regulated substance, is used by the impregnation process for manufacturing expandable polystyrene and is present in a quantity greater than its 10,000-pound threshold.  Two underground storage tanks supply the impregnation process.  When necessary a railcar is used to refill the storage tanks.  A third tank stores reclaimed pentane from the pentane recovery system.  Access to the n-pentane tanks and process area is restricted to authorized Dart"

      "SummaryText": "Polymers employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  Because the n-pentane used at Dart Polymers is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, it meets the criteria for Program 3.  \n\n\n3.  Chemical Accident Prevention Program\n\nDart Polymers complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Program rules for n-pentane.  All elements of the Chemical Accident Prevention Program requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for n-pentane.\n\nThe n-pentane equipment was designed to all applicable codes and standards using good engineering practices.  The process hazard analysis revalidation was performed on June 12, 2009 using the HAZOP methodology, and a process is in place to resolve all recommendations.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of n-pentane storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with n-pentane or n-pentane containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for n-pentane equipment and operations. \n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nNo accidental releases of n-pentane have occurred at Dart Polymers within the past five years.\n\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program\n\nDart Polymers has trained employees for emergency response and maintains a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Daviess County (Kentucky)  Emergency Management Agency, the Owensboro Fire Department, and Owensboro Medical Health System.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the fire department and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  All emergency responders including employees and offsite emergency and fire personnel have copies of the emergency response plan and are familiar with its use.\n\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nDart Polymers' safety program is dedicated to continuous improvement and pro"
