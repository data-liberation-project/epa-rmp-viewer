Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\n\n\nChelan Fruit Cooperative, (hereafter referred to as CFC) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of CFC to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\n\n\n    CFC refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\n\n\n\nAt CFC anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n\n\n\n* Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n\n* Reduce the threat to our personnel\n\n* Reduce the threat to the community\n\n\n\n\n\nB.    Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nCFC is a group of fruit processing and cold storage facilities, located near the city of Chelan, county of Chelan, city of Pateros / Brewster and Okanogan, county of Okanogan, state of Washington.\n\n\n\nThe regulate"

There is approximately 28,000 \n\npounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Chelan system. The largest interconnected\n\nsystem could potentially release 12,000 pounds of product.\n\n\n\nThere is approximately 23,215 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Brewster\n\nsystems.  The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n\n1 and #2, and potentially release 8,570 pounds of product.\n\n\n\nThere is approximately 17,655 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Pateros North \n\nsystem. The larger of the two independent systems ( South Engine Room ) could\n\npotentially release 10,009 pounds of product.\n\nThere  is  approximately  2,169 pounds  of  anhydrous ammonia  in the Pateros\n\nSouth system. The quantities present at this location are well below the 10,000\n\npound threshold and therefore does not require a RMP.  As such, Worst Case and\n\nAlternative Scenarios were not calculated.  If in the future this location increases it?s\n\ncapacity to the 10,000 threshold an amended RMP will be immediately submitted. \n\nIn order to provide the Pateros South facility and the surrounding area a higher \n\nlevel of safety, most components of this RMP and related PSM are applied to the\n\nPateros South facility.\n\n\n\nThere is approximately 23,827 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the Okanogan\n\nsystems. The largest interconnected system could potentially involve Engine Room\n\n`C? and `D? and release 7,640 pounds of product.   \n\n\n\nCFC uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the threshold limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, CFC believes in the concept set forth in the ?General Duty Clause? of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, CFC has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.

Wholesale outlet, by the     Okanogan River and the city of Okanogan to the west and a small hotel     and casino to the south.  The Omak facility is exclusively cold storage,     it's four miles to the north and does not     contain enough product to     warrant inclusion in this RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nV    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nA    Anhydrous Ammonia ( NH3 ) is commonly used as an effective refrigerant in cold storage facilities .  The type of refrigeration system used is a ?flooded? system, using a float switch and an electric operating solenoid valve for liquid level control and a back pressure regulator to control temperature.  In this process the liquid refrigerant flows from the liquid receiver through the liquid line, up to the electrically operated solenoid valve.  The evaporator in this system consists of a tubed coil.  It contains an electric solenoid valve, which maintains a constant level of liquid refrigerant under a low-side pressure. Vaporized refrigerant moves through the suction (vapor) line to the compressor where it is compressed to a high pressure and discharged into the condenser.  It is cooled by the condenser, returns to a liquid and flows into the liquid receiver.  There is currently, approximately 28,000 pounds of NH3 on the Chelan site, 17,655 pounds on the Pateros North site, 23,215 pounds on the Brewster site and 23,827 pounds on the Okanogan site.

This was based on a release from a .75? in diameter short pipe, at the bottom of the receiver, below the liquid line at all facilities.\n\n\n\nSurface Roughness\n\n\n\nRural surface roughness was chosen for both scenarios.  The selection was based on the fact that the surrounding area within a 1-mile radius is has very few buildings and is fairly open at all locations.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis (68.25)\n\n\n\nRMP regulation requires that a worst-case release scenario analysis be performed for each substance in excess of the regulatory threshold.  Since ammonia is the only substance onsite in excess of the threshold, only one worst-case scenario was performed.  \n\n\n\nThe quantity calculated for Chelan was the amount in the largest vessel, as required by 40 CFR 68.25(e), which is the high-pressure receiver.  The dimensions of the receiver are 4.5? in circumference and 20? in length, giving the receiver a volume of 318 cubic feet.  The amount of ammonia possible, if the vessel were to be filled to 100% capacity at 85 degrees F is 11,845 pounds. (Based on the weight of liquid ammonia at 85o F, which is 37.25 pounds per cubic foot.)  Since there is connecting piping to the receiver containing liquid ammonia, the actual amount used in modeling the worst-case release was 12,000 pounds.  Also, there are no administrative controls or passive mitigation used in this scenario to mitigate the effects of the release.
