      "SummaryText": "The El Paso Water Utilities - Public Service Board (EPWU-PSB) has prepared this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process located at Fred Hervey Water Reclamation Plant (FHWRP), in compliance with 40 CFR 68, found in the EPA's General Risk Management Program Guidance (GRM-PG), the registration for this process is presented in the GRM-PG - Appendix A. \r\n\r\nThe FHWRP is subject to the RMP regulation because the chlorination process at the FHWRP utilizes and/or stores a greater quantity of chlorine than the threshold quantity. The FHWRP is located at 1700 Railroad Drive in the northeast portion of the City of El Paso, Texas. The FHWRP is surrounded by urban, residential, and vacant land.\r\n\r\nCurrently the FHWRP has the potential to store up to three (3) one-ton chlorine containers in the chlorination storage area, allowing the potential to store a total of 6,000 pounds of chlorine. However, the normal storage is two (2) one-ton chlorine containers at any one time. The average amount of chlorine managed at FHWRP is 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCommunicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify potential receptors (Hazard Assessment). \r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario modeled by the ALOHA software indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 3 miles. The alternative release analysis indicates a vulnerable zone radius of 13 yards.  The Hazard Assessment shows an estimated population within the worst case scenario at 7,300 people, and the alternative more likely release estimated population is approximately 0 people. \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tDevelop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations."

The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process, and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.  \r\n\r\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures to adequately keep the  operators informed of human factors that may lead to accidental releases."
