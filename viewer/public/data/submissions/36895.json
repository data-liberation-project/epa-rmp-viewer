Introduction:\n\n\n\nThe  Royster-Clark Nitrogen terminal in Marseilles  receives\n\nfertilizers from barges, stores the fertilizer in tanks, and\n\nloads trucks.  The facility has two anhydrous ammonia tanks\n\nand four  urea  ammonium  nitrate (UAN) liquid  fertilizer\n\nstorage tanks.  In addition there are two dry warehouses and\n\na dry barge unloading facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.  Accidental Release Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Marseilles Terminal, has an\n\nexcellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries\n\nto facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964.\n\n\n\nThe facility safety record is the direct result of continued\n\nemphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors,\n\nand truck drivers.\n\nThere have not been any releases from the terminal that meet\n\nthe description of an RMP accidental release.\n\n\n\nIn case of a reportable chemical accident, information in\n\nthe RMP will be updated within six (6) months of the date\n\naccident accrued.\n\n\n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention Policies And\n\n\n\n   Activities:\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and concern for the\n\nenvironment must be second nature to all employees and\n\ncontractor personnel.\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works together to\n\nensure the facility is in compliance with OSHA's Process\n\nSafety Management standards and the accident prevention\n\nprograms are continuously improved.  A networked computer\n\nmanagement system is utilized to provide our employees with\n\nthe necessary tools and records to maintain the safety of\n\nthe process. This teamwork is an integral part in the safety\n\nefforts of this facility. Accident release prevention steps\n\ninclude the fourteen element program for Process Safety\n\nManagement, a management system, corporate oversight of the\n\nfacility, and a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\nRoyster-Clark Ni"
