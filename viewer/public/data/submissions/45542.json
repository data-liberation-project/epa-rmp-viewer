      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) updates the City of Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant from a Prevention Program 2 to a Prevention Program 3 and includes the required elements of Process Safety Management (PSM). Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI), a private contractor, operates the plant. A wastewater treatment plant operated by a private contractor is subject to Prevention Program 3, which encompasses the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM standards. The contents of this RMP and PSM document the Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant?s compliance with the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r)(7), 40 CFR 68, and 29 CFR 1910.119 for the protection of employees, the public and the environment.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been updated to include Process Safety Management. This involved the addition of sections on:\n?    Process Hazard Analysis \n?    Management of Change \n?    Pre-Startup Review\n?    Employee Participation Plans \n?    Hot Work Permits \n?    Contractors\n\nThe act of updating and resubmitting the RMP also involved a review or revision of the following:\n?    operating procedures\n?    training programs\n?    maintenance procedures\n?    equipment inspection\n?    Emergency Response Plan\n?    Emergency Response Training\n\nThe City of Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Weslaco emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and complies with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 907 North Airport Road, Weslaco, Hidalgo County, Texas, at North 26.174003 Latitude and West -97.977533 Longitude. The facility serves a population of approximately 27,000. Its chlorination bu"

The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility 24-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage are stored on site. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Wastewater Treatment Plant includes consideration of two release scenarios for each parameter of concern (chlorine): \n1. A Worst-Case Release\n2. An Alternative Scenario\nThe following key elements outline the accidental release prevention program for the Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant:\n\n$    High level of training of the operators;\n\n$    Preventive maintenance program;\n\n$    Use of state of the art process and safety equipment;\n\n$    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators;\n\n$    Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures;\n\n$    Implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include operator use of available Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) during connection/disconnection of the chemical supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and the presence of a chemical detector.  An Agreement with Chemical Response & Remediation Contractors, Inc.(CRRC) a local hazardous material team has been made for assistance with emergency response.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Weslaco=s Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility=s emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification pla"
