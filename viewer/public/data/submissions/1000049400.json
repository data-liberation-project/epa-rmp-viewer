      "SummaryText": "Abengoa Bioenergy Corporation (Abengoa) - Colwich, Kansas, manufactures ethyl alcohol (ethanol) as a fuel additive from the processing of corn and milo grains.  The ethanol produced is mixed with isopentane denaturant.  As a by-product of the alcohol manufacturing process, wet distiller's grains are produced for livestock feed.  All feedstocks and products are shipped to and from the site by truck and/or rail. \n\n \n\nMore specifically, the Abengoa production process is described as follows: \n\n\n\nCleaned corn is hammer-milled to meal that is then slurried with water. Through the combined action of heat and industrial enzymes, the starch in the mash is converted to fermentable sugars, which, in turn, are converted into carbon dioxide and alcohol by the action of yeast.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia may be added for pH control and to provide a nitrogen nutrient to the yeast. The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon pressure vessel.\n\n\n\nEthanol is stripped from the resulting beer by distillation and concentrated to a 190 proof alcohol/water azeotrope. The remaining moisture is removed from the alcohol by molecular sieve dehydration. Dehydrated ethanol is mixed with up to 2.8% denaturant and sold as fuel alcohol.\n\n\n\nDenatured ethanol is stored in four 50,000 gallon storage tanks at atmospheric pressure. The pure denaturant is stored in one 24,762 gallon storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe residue from the bottom of the beer distillation column, known as whole stillage, is pumped to centrifuges where suspended solids are separated from the dissolved solids. Some of the liquid decant, or thin stillage, is recycled to the front of the process as backset, and the remainder is concentrated by evaporation to a high-solids syrup. The syrup is combined with the cake from the Decanters to produce Wet Distillers Grains with Solubles (WDGS). The WDGS is marketed as animal feed. \n\n \n\nThe process requires utility systems to provide cooling water, chilled water, well water, instrument and plant air, an"

Program elements that are of particular importance in order to prevent potential accidental ammonia release, or fire and explosion are as follows:\n\n\n\n1)Process Safety Information (PSI): The ammonia and denaturant processes were designed in accordance with generally accepted good engineering practices and complies with design codes, electrical classifications, relief design sizing specifications, piping specifications, etc. The equipment is designed with multiple layers of protection to prevent, control or mitigate an accidental release, fire or explosion such as a water deluge systems, flare control, process area detectors, alarms and procedures, manual shut-offs, check valves, grounding equipment, relief valves and vents, and automatic shut-offs.\n\n\n\n2)Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): A process hazard analysis was conducted to systematically identify and evaluate hazards, controls, and consequences of failure. PHA's are revalidated at least every 5 years. However, the Abengoa facility was idled in 2012 and was restarted less than 6 months ago. The five year anniversary of the most recent PHA occurred during this idle time and therefore the PHA revalidations have been scheduled for 2015. \n\n\n\n3)Operating Procedures and Training: Clear instructions are provided for steps of each operating phase.

Equipment deficiencies that are found outside acceptable limits are corrected. \n\n\n\n7)Hot Work Permits: Welding, cutting and other \"hot work\" is only permitted to be conducted in accordance with the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements.\n\n\n\n8)Management of Change (MOC): Modifications to equipment, procedures, process conditions, etc. are only authorized after addressing the impact on safety and health, necessary updates to operating procedures, process safety information and training of affected employees.\n\n\n\nThe facility coordinates emergency response preparedness activities with the Sedgwick County Fire Department and other local responders. The facility emergency response plan provides evacuation instructions, notification information for alerting the public and neighboring facilities and the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
