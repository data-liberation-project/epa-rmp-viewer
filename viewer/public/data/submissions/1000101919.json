Transport of Anhydrous ammonia to ECGS is accomplished by using tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of about 5,000 to 7,000 gallons per delivery. When the units are operating, a delivery is scheduled every three (3) to five (5) weeks.\n\nThe 12,000-gallon horizontal storage tank has an outside diameter of 9-feet with a length of 23-feet and 5-inches.  The Ammonia Storage Tank is located inside an enclosure that is adjacent to the unloading area.  The floor beneath the storage tank is slightly sloped towards a sump (with drain) in the north western corner of the enclosure.  This area is sloped to contain and drain accidental spills.  In addition, the ammonia-handling facility is equipped with extensive ammonia detection and alarm systems to protect workers and equipment in the event of a malfunction anywhere within the system.\n\nThe use of equipment for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia in support of the SCR project will require compliance with several environmental and safety regulatory requirements, including preparation of this RMP pursuant to the CalARP Program.  The quantity of ammonia on-site also triggers the federal RMP program pursuant to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  An RMP is required under the CalARP program and at the discretion of the local administering agency (AA).  In Imperial County, the AA is the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC), which also is the local Unified Program Agency (UPA).  The DTSC has informed the ECGS that an RMP will be required in connection with the anhydrous ammonia system in operation at their facilities. \n\nThis document is the RMP prepared for submittal to DTSC to address the facility for the unloading, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at the ECGS.

      "SummaryText": "El Centro Generating Station (ECGS), located at 485 East Villa Road, El Centro, California operates four (4) power generation units along with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) for three combustion turbines.   SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOX emission control technology that speeds up reaction process for removal of NOX from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process.  A reducing agent is used to reduce NOX emissions, primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst.  The most common reducing agent (reagent) used with SCR is ammonia.  Injection of the correct ammonia/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst, initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack.  The ECGS uses anhydrous ammonia (60,000 pounds) as the reagent for the SCR reactions. For this purpose, ECGS stores 60,000 pounds or 12,000 gallons in a single ammonia storage tank.\n\nDue to the hazardous nature of anhydrous ammonia, ECGS is required to develop and implement specific regulatory requirements, enforced by both local and federal government agencies, including Federal Risk Management Plan (RMP), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM), and a Seismic Analysis (SA) of the facilities, operations, and equipment.    All regulatory requirements for the use and storage of anhydrous ammonia at the ECGS are found within:\n- Title 40 Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations;\n- Title 20 Section 1910.119 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and\n- Sections 25531 - 25543.3 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n\nECGS is a generation facility that consists of three (3) steam turbine generators and three (3) gas turbine generators.  A single 12,000-gallon (60,000-lb) anhydrous ammonia tank is located within ECGS facility to supply various SCR systems for each combustion unit wi"
