The primary activity at the Jackson Lake Gas Plant (Facility) is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold to offsite facilities.  The purpose of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to strive for the prevention of NGL accidental releases from the facility and to reduce the serverity of any releases which may occur.\r\n\r\nThe flammable regulated chemical mixture at the JLGP facility is natural gas liquids (NGL), which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include N-Butane, Isobutane, Propane and Ethane.  These regulated chemicals have a RMP regulated threshold quantity (TQL) of 10,000 pound.  The chemical abstract service (CAS) number for NGL is not applicable.  However the CAS number for the individual constituents are as follows:  Pentane 109-66-0, Isopentane 78-8-4, Butane 106-97-8, Isobutane 75-28-5, Propane 74-98-6, Ethane 74-84-0 and Methane 74-82-8.\r\n\r\nThe JLGP facility stores up to 72,000 gallons of NGL in 3 above ground storage tanks.  The tanks contain a maximum of 116,418 pounds of regulated flammable chemicals.  This facility also stores the following in above ground storage tanks.\r\n- 2 Condensate Tanks, 400 BBL, Atmospheric Tank\r\n- 1 Slug Catcher, 30,000 Gal\r\n- 1 Brine Tank, 200 BBL, Atmospheric Tank\r\n\r\nThe RMP*COMPTM program developed by the CAMEO team at the Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was applied for the worst case release scenario (WCRS).

For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (PSI) for vapor cloud explosions.  he release parameters are:  wind speed 1/5 meters per second (m/s) and atmospheric stability F.\r\n\r\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.4 miles from the facility.  Based on a site visit of the adjacent properties with a 0.4 radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS are is zero (0).  Public receptors, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.4 miles of the facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  The facility was commissioned in 2015 and has not had an NGL release.\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Program which includes and Emergency Response Plan.  The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment.  The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post=incident decontamination of affected areas.  The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and it's inspection, testing and maintenance.  In the event of an NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure as well as procedures to inform authorities are included.  A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map, SDS', and a list of chemicals are kept at the facility and should be referenced in the event of a release.  The Emergency Response Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to"
