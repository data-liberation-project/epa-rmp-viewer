      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The facility's overall approach and commitment to proper chemical management is demonstrated by training, procedures, and maintenance systems currently in place at the facility.  The facility is committed to ensuring safe operations in accordance with Part 68 requirements and has established a senior manager responsible for Part 68 implementation and compliance.\n\nSource and Federal Regulated Substances Description:  The Southeast Distribution Center is located in Suwanee, Georgia.  The facility is a distribution center for laboratory equipment and laboratory-grade chemicals.  The facility is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68 due to onsite storage of chloroform, ethyl ether, hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid.  The one (1) regulated process at the facility is the storage of chemicals.  A review of numerous inventory data indicated that the facility had approximately 12,620 pounds of ethyl ether; 20,600 pounds of chloroform; 13,510 pounds of hydrochloric acid; and 960 pounds of hydrofluoric acid in storage.  The amounts of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid differ from that amount listed in Section 1.17 of this document; the amount in Section 1.17 is the federal threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds for hydrochloric acid and 1,000 pounds for hydrofluoric acid.  The facility predictively filed for hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid in the event that the quantity of this material stored on site exceeds the threshold quantity over the next five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The facility has instituted procedures for the packing and labeling of chemicals to prevent releases.  In addition, new employees are trained on release procedures during new employee orientation.  Remaining employees receive refresher training on release procedures annually during emergency evacuation procedures and drill training.  In addition, individual departm"

      "SummaryText": "ents discuss chemical handling and release prevention approximately every two months.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  The facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents or releases of ethyl ether, chloroform, hydrochloric acid or hydrofluoric acid within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has instituted a facility emergency response team consisting of employees from various shifts.  The team has received training as described in 29 CFR 1910.120.  If the first responders are not able to contain a release, the facility has contracted with an outside contractor, Onyx ES, for emergency response.  The facility has also coordinated response efforts with the Gwinnett County Department of Fire and Emergency Services.  The facility has established a notification mechanism to ensure that the Department will be properly notified when response is required for a release and has provided the Department with a copy of its emergency response plan and evacuation procedures.  The facility submitted copies of its SARA 302, 311, and 312 reports to the Department.  The facility is subject to emergency response plan requirements including 29 CFR 1910.138 and 1910.120.  In addition, the facility is subject to the preparedness and prevention requirements of 40 CFR 265 Subpart C since the facility is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Periodic reviews of the program, training, and maintenance procedures are conducted to ensure that any necessary and appropriate changes are made to maintain and improve safety."
