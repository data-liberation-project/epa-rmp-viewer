The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane. Butane is stored onsite at a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs for blending into gasoline.  The equipment which handles butane includes piping, storage - (4) butane bullets, and (1) butane sphere, and pumps. The maximum inventory for the system is 9,526,126 lbs of butane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe East Houston Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures. Over the last 5 years there have been no reports of a harmful butane release at this location.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Magellan's policy to notify the East Houston LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\n\nThe regulated butane blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the butane proce"

Within the past five years the butane process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP Rule.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicted within the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information and belief the information submitted is true, accurate and complete. \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process. As opportunities for improvement associated with this process arises at the East Houston Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P.\n\n"
