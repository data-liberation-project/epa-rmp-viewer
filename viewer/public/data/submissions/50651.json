      "SummaryText": "Crop Service Center is a agricultural services company that provides crop inputs to farmers.  This location is designed to be retail fertilizer facility as well as an acid neutralizing and fertilizer upgrading facility.  This facility has 2 11,250 gal anhydrous ammonia tanks for a total storage of 99000 pounds.  The worst case scenario is designed for a total tank release of 49,500 pounds in 10 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 0.67 miles.  The alternative release secenario was a release of 11,800 bounds from a pipe break which resulted in a distance to endpoint of 0.41 miles.  This is a new facility and will be built to the standards and we will maintain the facility according to these standards to ensure the system's integrity.  The prevention program will be in place prior to filling the tanks.\n\nOUR COMPANY STRIVES TO MAINTAIN A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK PLACE.  THE PRESIDENT AND EMPLOYEES HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO PLAN THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA."
