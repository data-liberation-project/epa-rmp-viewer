California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\nA?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR A?68\nA?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR A?5189\nA?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR A?1910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\".  As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary.  To accomplish this, Simonian Fruit has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.  This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1    SIMONIAN FRUIT, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Simonian Fruit has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.  This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which has the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia    16,000 lb\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.  The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nSimonian Fruit has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: \n1.    Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP and RMP obligations as well\n2"

Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Simonian Fruit employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nSimonian Fruit operates a commercial cold storage for deciduous tree fruit and grapes.  Our facility has one ammonia system which provides refrigerating capacity to two cold storage rooms equipped with forced air cooling and five cold storage rooms for palleted product.\nThe systems operate as follows: high pressure liquid from our main receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature & pressure accumulator vessels.  From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel.  The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our engine room main suction accumulator.  From there it is piped to the reciprocating compressors.  The high pressure discharge from the compressor is sent to the water cooled condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver. \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with standard design, and installation of ammonia mechanical refrigerating systems.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere i"

Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating our system as a single process.\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n1.3.1    GENERAL \nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.  During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nSimonian Fruit has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Simonian Fruit facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.  It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSimonian Fruit has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AN"

California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\nA?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility.  All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.  \nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, Simonian Fruit continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.  This has improved Simonian Fruit's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors.  In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Simonian Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nSimonian Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.  When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date.  Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well.  A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document eve"

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Simonian Fruit employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the RMP-PSM program Simonian Fruit will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n"
