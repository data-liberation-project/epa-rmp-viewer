      "SummaryText": "At this facility we use a closed system process to strip natural gas liquids (NGL) from natural gas.  Natural gas liquids are a flammable mixture that the EPA considers hazardous.  The predominant components of the flammable mixture produced from this process are propane and butane, with ethane and iso-butane as minor constituets.  The purpose of the facility is to strip off NGL to lower the BTU content of the natural gas to a marketable level.  Approximately 75,000 pounds of NGL is produced at this facility on a monthly basis.  The NGL is shipped by truck transport as soon as enough product is available to make a full load (approx. 35,000 pounds of NGL).  For this reason, the total NGL in the storage tank seldom reaches 70% of its 67,000 pound capacity.  The worst case scenario is the release of a full tank of NGL.   The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi for this worst case scenario is .30 miles.  The alternative scenario is a pull-a-way of the loading line.  The scenario involves our observer shutting a manual valve within two minutes of the pull-a-way.  This scenario produces a distance to endpoint of 1 psi of .30 miles  There has not been a reportable release or reportable incident at this facility since it was installed.  Emergency response is coordinated by the McKean County LEPC and the Bradford Township Fire Department, with immediate response provided by the Corden Township Volunteer Fire Department.  The site is manned on a daily basis (Monday - Friday).  The storage tank is enclosed within a fence with a locked gate.  Transfers are made only when a Belden and Blake attendent is available."
