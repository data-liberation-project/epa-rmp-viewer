This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, the terminals' trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe North Little Rock Terminal, located near Little Rock, Arkansas, uses Butane for Butane blending of gasoline to increase the oxygenate concentrations in refined gasoline. The Butane is blended with gasoline, which is also stored at the facility in atmospheric tanks, then loaded into DOT approved tanker trucks and shipped to retail based outlets and gasoline service stations, for consumer use.  As a result of this operation, several regulated flammable substances are stored on site.  The other regulated substances are not covered by OSHA'S Process Safety Management Standards ( 29 CFR 1910.119 ), meet the exemptions of 40 CFR 112( r )for RMP reporting, and therefore are not included as a separate process within this executive summary report.  The North Little Rock Terminal does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.  \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the terminal, is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) resulting from a release of 337,400  pounds of butane from the largest storage vessel (Tank # 401 of the Butane storage tanks).

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.6 mile.  There are no public or environmental receptors identified within the 0.6 mile radius.  \nThe most likely alternative release scenario (ARS) for a flammable substance was a failure of a seal on transfer pump BP # 420.  Release volume was minimized to 500 lbs of the entire contents of the vessel, since there are ESD and excess flow valves on TK #410.  The ARS assumed a 500 lb release of /vapor to atmosphere over a period of 10 minutes, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event was less than 200 feet. There were no public or environmental receptors that were identified within the 0.3 mile endpoint radius.  There were no public or environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint however, it should be noted that there is a major Interstate highway (I - 40) approximately .9 mi. to the South which should have consideration for protection of the general public.  .  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response training.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the terminal.  The Butane blending process at the terminal that is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation, and is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the terminal's PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the terminal and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe North Little Rock Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The area Safety Department in conjunction with terminal personnel is assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The terminal has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, flow, level, composition) in the terminal's Operating Procedures, and ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown sys"

This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe North Little Rock terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe North Little Rock terminal primarily uses the HAZOP analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analysis is recognized by OSHA and the EPA as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are addressed locally and by the company's corporate Safety and Engineering Departments for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.
