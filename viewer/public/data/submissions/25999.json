Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Full-Fill Industries, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental \nsafety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention \nprogram that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and \nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement \nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of aerosol cans.  We have 2 \nregulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-\nmethyl] and Propane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used as an aerosol propellant.  Propane \nis used as an  aerosol propellant.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario to perform the required offsite consequence \nanalysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  \nThe following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from A-70.  In this scenario 81500 lb. of a flammable mixture of \nPropane and Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is \nreleased as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity \nparticipating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated \ndistance of 0.35 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable"

The scenario \ninvolves the release of 33107.78 lb. of a flammable mixture of Propane and Isobutane  [Propane, \n2-methyl] is released in 10 minutes. The release is also controlled by active mitigation measures \nthat include automatic shutoff valve.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance \nto the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.16 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\n                Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and \nconstructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections \nbriefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFull-Fill Industries, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the \nchemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nHAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in \nengineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any \nfindings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent \nPHA/update was performed on 01/03/2002.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Full-Fill \nIndustries, LLC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various \nmodes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary oper"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more \nfrequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFull-Fill Industries, LLC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process \nequipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes \namong others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, \nemergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by \nqualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these \npersonnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by \nthe maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Full-Fill Industries, LLC to manage changes in process \nchemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of \nmaintenance procedures was performed on 02/13/2002.  Process operators, maintenance \npersonnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process \nconditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes \nare conducted as a regular practice at Full-Fill Industries, LLC.
