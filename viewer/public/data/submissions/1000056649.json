Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n    \n\nThe Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC Plant, which is located at 246 Johnson Riley Road in Calvert City, is a Program 3 facility in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\n    \n\nThe largest feedstock, Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM), is used in the production of polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH).  VAM, in the quantities handled at this facility, is considered hazardous by EPA under the Risk Management Rule.  \n\n    \n\nSekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety and environmental performance.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, Commonwealth of Kentucky and local rules and regulations.  The Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC Site Leader at the Calvert City plant is responsible for facility operation.  The Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC Operations Leader reports to the Site Leader and has overall responsibility for compliance with all aspects of the facility's Risk Management Plan.  Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) operates under a tiered Management System, with policies and procedures cascading from Corporate requirements to detailed plant operating and safe work practices.  \n\n    \n\nAs a site that has a covered process regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, the Calvert City plant strives to prevent chemical emergencies.  Prevention of chemical emergencies includes specifying that all equipment, piping, vessels, tanks, etc. meet all applicable design codes and specifications.  Documentation of these codes and specifications form the basis of our process safety information including flow diagrams, piping and instrument diagrams, process descriptions, and other documentation.

Employees are regularly trained, certified, and subject to random substance abuse checks to ensure the safety of the plant.  Our safety process contains many other elements including management of change, hot work procedures and regular process hazards analysis using the hazard identification tools.  All contractors working at the plant are subject to the same rules and procedures that Sekisui Specialty Chemicals America, LLC employees must follow under the contractor safety program.  \n\n    \n\nThe emergency response plan includes Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) training and qualifications for on-site employees.

The only RMP covered process is the Polyvinyl Alcohol production unit.  \n\n\n\nIn the PVOH unit, VAM is polymerized in a solvent to make polyvinyl acetate (PVAc).  PVAc is converted to polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), which is ground to a granule, dried, stored, packaged and shipped in bags, trucks and railcars.  PVOH is a water soluble powder that is used in applications such as water-based adhesives and to protect fibers as they are woven into fabrics.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this stationary source is:\n\n\n\n?Vinyl Acetate with the maximum quantity in an individual storage tank of 118,075 pounds\n\n\n\n3.  The worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\n\n\nIn the plant, the greatest VAM inventory is contained in one of three storage tanks.   Under worst case conditions of a single tank failure, the entire contents of the tank would be released from the tank and be contained in an earthen dike around the tanks.  Using the EPA look-up tables for rural terrain, the vaporized VAM would spread to endpoint that would exceed plant boundaries.  Although there are active controls directed at preventing such a release and controlling the consequences, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in evaluating this Worst Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative case for a toxic liquid at the plant is the overpressure of a PVOH polymerization reactor and a subsequent VAM release from the pressure relief system.  It was calculated that 5,900 pounds of VAM were released and vaporized to the environment.  Using the EPA lookup tables and default weather conditions, the radius to the endpoint would exceed plant boundaries.  Even though the EPA methodology would allow credit for active mitigation methods, no such credit was taken.  \n\n\n\nThe PVOH polymerization reactors"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention measures:  \n\n\n\nKey to the plant's prevention programs are the layers of protection provided at each process.  The hierarchy starts with the facility design and construction which is to all applicable design standards using qualified engineers and contractors.  A comprehensive mechanical integrity program includes routine checks of all process equipment, tanks, vessels and piping.  These checks are done using nondestructive testing techniques and kept in the permanent equipment files.  \n\n\n\nTrained operators working with current operating procedures and process safety information keep the processes operating safely and in environmental compliance.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to keep the process within these limits and provide the information and control to properly operate each process in normal, startup/shutdown and emergency conditions.  Instrumentation alarms alert plant operators to deviations and provide early warning to process upsets.  \n\n\n\nIn the event an upset leads to an uncontrolled condition, process safety devices including critical interlocks that activate automatic shutdowns, pressure relief valves, rupture disks, and flame arrestors are in place to safely control upset conditions.
