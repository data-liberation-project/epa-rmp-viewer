FHRA purchased this refinery in April 2004 from Williams Alaska Petroleum, Inc. Since doing so, FHRA has gone to great efforts to further develop and prioritize health and safety performance at the refinery. At FHRA, safety is a value.  As such, it defines who FHRA is and what we believe in. The refinery has made a commitment to both employee and public safety. Our vision is to be recognized as a leader for safe operations ensuring the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, and neighbors. Our first priority is prevention. This priority is demonstrated by the resources we have invested in accident prevention. These include designing and constructing our equipment to meet stringent, nationally recognized standards of performance. We operate and maintain our equipment to ensure reliability, which also serves as a measure of how safe an operation is. We train our employees to recognize the importance of safety and to incorporate safety as a value, both at work and at home.  In the event that a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.  Our emergency responders train regularly, not only at the refinery but also at  internationally known training centers. We train, not just internally, but also with our mutual aid partners - local emergency responders, on a regular basis. Our goal is to have the best trained, best equipped emergency response capability that is never used, except to drill.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe refinery operates a variety of processes to produce all grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, asphalt, and jet fuel, from crude oil. The refinery does not handle or process threshold quantities of toxic highly hazardous chemicals per this regulation. As a result,"

The Extraction Unit was shut down and de-inventory activities commenced on May 1, 2014.  Crude Unit #2 was shut down and de-inventory activities commenced on May 24, 2014.  The closure of these units ended production of refined products.  FHRA will continue to market fuels through the North Pole Terminal.  FHRA is entertaining offers for the assets associated with the refinery as an ongoing enterprise.\r\n\r\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE THE LAST RMP SUBMIT\r\nAs part of the process of re-validating the RMP the following changes were made for resubmission:\r\n\r\nSection 1: Registration - Crude Unit No. 1 and Crude Unit No.3 have been removed due to unit shut down. These processes previously had been designated Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nSection 5: Alternative Release Scenarios for Flammables. Crude Unit 2 was identified as the new Alternative Release Scenario (as opposed to previous Crude Unit 3 as Alternative Release Scenario). RMP Comp was used in the calculation of the distance to a 1 PSI overpressure. Golden Valley Electrical Association (GVE) and Petrostar Refinery are noted as a potential Public Receptor.\r\n\r\nSection 7: Prevention program Level 3. As noted above, removed Crude Unit 1 and Crude Unit 3 due to unit shut down.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nFHRA has had no reported accidental releases of a regulated substance that have resulted in on-site or off-site impacts, injuries or deaths in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at FHRA. Program 3 processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees\r\nhave access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues.\r\nThese initiatives include the active employee participation on the site's EHS Council (Safety Committee) to solicit ideas and concerns from employees as they relate to process safety and accident prevention.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nFHRA has available technical documents that are needed to maintain safe operation of the refinery. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment\r\nconsiderations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards associated with handling and exposure to the chemicals.  The refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition, flow, pressure).

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nFHRA has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined on a regular basis to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  FHRA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as\r\nengineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nIf ways are found to make processes safer, all appropriate individuals, including corporate management, are involved in implementing the improvements. FHRA tackles those changes which can have the greatest impact on safety first. All recommendations for improvement are tracked, to be sure that they are implemented in a timely manner.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide consistent training of new operators. These procedures are annually reviewed and certified as current and accurate.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their jobs.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHRA has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. After operators demonstrate through tests, skills demonstration, and other methods used to determine that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at\r\nthe highest level. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nFHRA uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, FHRA evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nFHRA conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nFHRA has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

      "SummaryText": "evention program is functioning properly, FHRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years (last audit was conducted in March 2013). The audit team typically is an independent, autonomous group, and contains at least one or more individuals knowledgeable in the process being audited. The audit team develops findings that are\r\nforwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe processes at FHRA have potential hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at the refinery. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the refinery has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate)\r\na release. The following types of safety features are used where appropriate throughout the refinery:\r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Major process relief valves that discharge to a monitored flare system to capture episodic releases.\r\n2. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n4. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system,\r\nbackup firewater equipment)\r\n5. Atmospheric relief de"

Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nFHRA maintains a written emergency response plan program to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local\r\nemergency response agencies. In addition, FHRA has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  The emergency response program for the refinery has been coordinated with the Fairbanks North Star Borough. This coordination has been facilitated through the LEPC, Fairbanks North Star\r\nBorough Office of Emergency Management, and specific meetings with participants from the City of North Pole and the Fairbanks North Star Borough. FHRA has around-the-clock communications capability with emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department), who provide the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDiligent compliance with our Risk Management Program forms the framework in which we will continue to improve the level of safety at FHRA.

These policies (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nFHRA has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes are properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing\r\ncontrols have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nFHRA promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or could result in, a fire/explosion, chemical loss of containment, major property damage, environmental impact, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a\r\nrecurrence, and tracks response to the recommendations in the site's Action Item Management System. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are accessible all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA\r\nrevalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident pr"
