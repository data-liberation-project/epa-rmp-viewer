The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 36.620187, -119.452274. The facility is located approximately 12 miles east of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agricultural land.\n\n\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nTrinity Packing Company is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps revealed that there are no faults in close proximity to the site. The USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Trinity Packing Company has a <1% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Description of Covered Process\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access.

The high pressure receiver receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receiver is also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receiver contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulators\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from t"

The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows.

To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Direct Expansion)\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature.

The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\n\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint.

The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Safety Systems\n\n\n\nThe machinery room is equipped with a high level and low level ammonia detector. At ammonia concentrations exceeding 25 ppm, an email or text is automatically sent to select Trinity Packing Company personnel and audible/visual alarms are activated inside and outside the machinery room. At 100 ppm, the emergency ventilation fan is automatically activated, and at 5,000 ppm, the compressors are de-energized. Additionally, each refrigerated room and the hydrocooler is equipped with an ammonia detector which will send a text/email at 25 ppm, and activate audible/visual alarms inside each room. \n\n\n\nEach Emergency Control Box (ECB) was installed in accordance with the Fire Code at the time of construction.
