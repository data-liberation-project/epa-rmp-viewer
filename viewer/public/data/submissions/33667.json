              "Description": "Up to 2 times per year liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the storage tank, through a meter and then through a heat exchanger where the liquid anhydrous ammonia is vaporized.  After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  The anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e., 10-34-0).\n\nSituated above the holding pool is a cooling tower with a fan that pulls air up the tower off of the holding pool.  The ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to the top of the cooling tower where it flows down packing (i.e., Pall Rings) back down to the holding pool.  While falling down the packing, the water evaporates and cools the solution.\n\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization, flows back to the holding pool and some of the solution flows to a storage tank.",

      "SummaryText": "Agriliance LLC - Cozad\nFacility Manager:  Mike Bellamy\nFacility Telephone:  (308) 784-4000\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of the Cozad facility are committed to providing a safe workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers used for crop production nutrients.  The facility maintains approximately 132 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for customer use.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the nurse tanks is approximately 616,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the stationary tanks at the facility is approximately 196,000 pounds stored in one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded by rail tank car and transport truck.  The facility may have up to twelve (12) 34,200 gallon rail tank cars holding 150,000 pounds each (at 85% full) located at the facility"

      "SummaryText": " at one time.  The maximum quantity stored in the twelve (12) rail cars would be approximately 1,800,000 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be approximately 2,612,000 pounds.  This would occur when there are twelve (12) fully loaded railcars and all of the nurse tanks and the three (3) on-site stationary tanks are at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\nUp to 2 times per year 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammonia is delivered by a high pressure gas cargo tank truck and stored in a pressurized aboveground storage tank.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a 34,200 gallon rail tank car.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 150,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.19 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the rail tank car is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a three (3) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from one of the storage tanks to a nurse tank.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 27,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 13,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.

Additionally, the contractor must act responsibly.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\n \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of equipment and procedures."
