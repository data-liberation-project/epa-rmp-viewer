      "SummaryText": "The Water Treatment Plant, located at 3441 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, FL is rated at 57.5 million gallons per day and services approximately 140,000 persons. The plant utilizes Lime Softening, Membrane Softening, and Reverse Osmosis to treat water from the Biscayne Aquifier and the Floridan Aquifier. Regulating agencies include the State of Florida Department of Health, State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency, Broward County Department of Natural Resource Protection, and the South Florida Water Management District.\n\nThe plant utilizes Chlorine as a primary disinfectant of it's finished water. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies Chlorine in any form (gaseous or liquid) as being an Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS). It is stored on-site in an enclosed building in one (1) ton cylinders and average usage is about seven hundred (700) pounds per day. \n\nReleases and their off-site consequences were accomplished using the RMPComp scenarios presented in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) web-site.\n\nA Worst-Case scenario assumes a release of two thousand (2,000) pounds from a storage vessel (one ton cylinder) in ten (10) minutes. A toxic end-point of 0.9 miles would affect approximately twelve thousand (12,000) residents under this scenario. Because of the closed stucture of the chlorine building, a release off-site of this magnitude is unlikely.\n\nAn Alternative-Case scenario assumes a release of approximately fifty (50) pounds from a storage vessel (one tone cylinder) in ten (10) minutes. A toxic end-point of 0.1 miles in this scenario would affect approximately two thousand five hundred (2,500) residents. Again, because of engineering controls, training, Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Corrective Maintenance (CM) practices which are performed by plant personnel, off-site consequences would be unlikely under this scenario.\n\nThe plant is covered under OSHA's Process Safety Manage"

This standard ...provides methods for systematically assessing the consequences related to preventing unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals into locations which could expose employees and othes to serious hazards. As part of this standard plant personnel engage in PM and CM practices, trainiing, and other related duties to reduce the risk associated with an accidental relaease of chlorine.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures for Handling, Storage, Preventive and Corrective Maintenance ensure that plant personnel are trained and ready to handle unusual situations as they occurr.\n\nWe have had one (1) accidental release (July 1995) of approximately sisxteen (16) pounds of chlorine during the past five (5) years. Plant personnel were evacuated, emergency crews responded, and one person off-site required minor medical attention.\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action plan coordinated with the State of Florida Emergency Response Commission, Broward County Department of Natural Resource Protection, the Local Emergency Planning Council, the City of Hollywood Fire Department, and the City of Hollywood Risk Management Division. Employees are trained in emergency response, accident and incident reporting, first-aid, fire prevention, hazard communication, confined spaces, slips, trips, and falls, cardio pulmonary resuscitation, and fire extinguisher usage. Chlorine drills, coordinated with the City of Hollywood Fire Department and others, are held quarterly too assess readiness of equipment and people in the event of an accidental release."
