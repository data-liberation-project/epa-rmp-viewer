This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Shell Western E&P Inc. (SWEPI) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n    SUBSTANCES\n\nSWEPI operates the Calumet Gas Plant located in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana.  Tejas Gas Processing, LLC is the owner of this facility.  The Calumet Gas Plant is a refrigerated lean oil absorption plant which extracts natural gas liquids from an inlet stream of produced natural gas.  The plant recovers natural gas liquids from the American Natural Resources (ANR) and Trunkline Pipeline Companies.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline and truck.\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, SWEPI identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  These are the quantities maintained in process vessels and piping at normal operating conditions and does not necessarily represent maximum capacities of the equipment.\n\nListed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Calumet Gas Plant are condensate, rich/lean oil, propane, natural gas liquids, natural gas and sponge oil.  However, SWEPI has determined that condensate has an NFPA flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public r"

Therefore, the Calumet Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance in a vessel forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  The worst-case distance calculations were based on the largest vessel of each substance at 100% capacity.  Natural gas liquids is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.53-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for propane as follows.  A 2-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck tank.  The propane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for propane. The alternative-case release of propane resulted in a 0.28-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative release scenarios for toxic substances are not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCI"

Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Calumet Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n \nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in caring out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Calumet Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Calumet Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n Universal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Calumet Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydroca"

Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Deluge system for specific equipment\n1. Personnel trained in emergency procedures\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases.\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURE INFORMATION\n\nThe Calumet Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Calumet Gas Plant.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Calumet Gas Plant is coordinated with the St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local go"
