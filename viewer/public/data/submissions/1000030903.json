      "SummaryText": "RMP 2012 Update - Executive Summary\n\n\n\nInternational Seafoods of Alaska, Inc. (ISA) processes seafood at this facility, using anhydrous ammonia for the operation of a cold storage and various freezing systems.  The approximate inventory of ammonia onsite is 29,050 lbs., split between two independent refrigeration systems.  ISA has been operating in Kodiak since 1980.  ISA is a wholly owned subsidiary of True World Holdings LLC.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention - To insure safe operation & prevention of accidental releases this facility complies with OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP programs, including appropriate implementation of emergency action and emergency response plans.  Refrigeration system operators and safety personnel are trained in preventive maintenance and possible emergency response scenarios. Management procedures ensure that correct components, materials and proper engineering practices are followed for all new installations.\n\nTrained operators monitor and record the refrigeration processes 24/7.  Any deviations from normal operating limits are reported and corrected as soon as possible in order to reduce the possibility for breakdown or accidental release.\n\nWorst Case Accidental Release Scenario - The greatest release that could be possible would be from the Low Pressure Receiver (LPR) if it was filled to 80% (eighty percent) and was at a pressure of 50 psig and a rupture of the vessel or the liquid pump suction pipes caused the 16,000 lbs contents to be released over 10 (ten) minutes. Even though the release would likely be mitigated by the walls of the engine room, EPA's models estimate end-point of the vapor cloud could be 1.2 miles from the plant.  This scenario requires that:\n\n1.    the plant is not operating, with all the compressors off for at least 48 hours, and\n\n2.    the ammonia liquid had been previously pumped into the LPR to its 80% level, and\n\n3.    an earthquake or similar unforeseen event caused the LPR to rock off its stand or caused the pump"

      "SummaryText": "s to break off the bottom of the LPR vessel.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - A more likely release scenario would be that the plant is operating normally when an earthquake might break the 3 (three) inch liquid return pipe running between the condenser in front of the plant to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR) in the engine room, a distance of about 102 feet.  If this pipe were to break at a weld or a flange and since it is outside the building and the HPR would be at 120 psig, the contents of the HPR vessel and the pipe would quickly flow out of the breach due to pressure difference and vaporize to form a cloud.  According to EPA's modeling software, the estimated end-point of the vapor cloud would be 0.2 miles from the plant.\n\nAccident History - For the life of ISA's operations and for the past five years, there have been no on-site or off-site accidental releases resulting in injury or death, property damage or environmental damage. \n\nEmergency Response Program - The company takes its responsibilities for the safety of its employees and the community very seriously.  ISA's emergency response program, safety procedures and protocols for both the RMP and PSM are constantly reviewed for improvement.  ISA coordinates these efforts with the local fire department, Kodiak Island Borough LEPC and other seafood processors in Kodiak.  The company also participated with other Alaska industry partners and regulatory agency partners on an OSHA Strategic Partnership (OSP) to develop guidelines for PSM Compliance specific to seafood processors using ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\nAt present ISA has one certified refrigeration operator and intends to send more operators for comprehensive training and certification in the near future.\n\n"
