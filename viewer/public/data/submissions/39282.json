The policy complies with all pertinent procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The Pasco County emergency response policy involves the preparation of site-specific response plans, taking into consideration the available emergency response services surrounding each facility. The emergency response policy is in accordance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB.  The Little Road Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located at 8215 Little Road in Pasco County.  The WTP employs treatment processes to remove impurities from the water and disinfect it with chlorine.  Disinfection of all public water supplies is necessary to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and dysentery.  The WTP contains a chlorination room which houses two chlorinators and various process piping; an outdoor, open, roofed chlorine storage area with up to sixteen 2000-pound (or ton) chlorine cylinders; and assorted safety equipment.  The operations room containing flow recorders, various electrical panels, and additional safety equipment is located approximately 50 feet away from the chlorination room.  The facility is staffed 10 hours per day, seven days per week. The facility is equipped with an auto dialer to notify on-call personnel of a problem when the plant is not staffed.  Tampa Bay Water also monitors the plant by computer 24 hours per day and notifies the on-call operators in the event of an alarm at the plant.\n \nC.  The Pasco County Utility Services accidental release prevention program consist of the following elements:\n-The ongoing and continuous training of the operators.\n-A preventative maintenance program that follows manufacturer's specifications and acceptable engineering practices.\n-The implementation of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment.\n-Ongoi"

The Little Road WTP has experienced no accidental releases of chlorine over the past five (5) years.\n\nE.  The Little Road facility has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This plan consists of a chain of command decision tree for the response to a release of chlorine.  The plan coordinates local and regional organizations to combat the effects of the release."
