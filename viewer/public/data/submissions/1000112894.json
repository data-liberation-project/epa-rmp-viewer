The manual also includes detailed Hazard Assessment and Risk Management Plan submittal information.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\nAt the time of this RMP submission, there are no RMP-related accidents to report. \n\nThe emergency response program:\nThe warehouse maintains an emergency action plan which is in place to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The warehouse is a defensive facility and relies on local responders when there is a need. The program consists of procedures for evacuating the warehouse and making notifications to appropriate emergency personnel. The Distribution Center Manager coordinates at least annually with the Mount Joy Fire Department to ensure they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the warehouse. Site employees are regularly trained on the emergency action plan including identification of potential emergency situations, response notification and evacuation.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements corrective actions resulting from process safety activities such as Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), incident investigations, and compliance audits.

Our overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated through the existing management, training, procedural, and maintenance systems in place at the facility and the hazard assessment, prevention program and emergency response provisions implemented for the covered process. The site has an integrated management system to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP program as well as compliance with applicable regulations, codes, and standards such as OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\nHolcim is a distribution warehouse located in Mount Joy, PA. The warehouse handles, stores and distributes various materials for the manufacture of building products, particularly insulation. There is no chemical processing or manufacturing at the warehouse. The covered process entails the receipt, handling, and storage of various products in small containers. \n\nSome of the products are regulated flammable mixtures which include pentane, ethylene and propylene. The quantity of the covered products stored in the warehouse can fluctuate based on the season, therefore a conservative approach was taken in determining the maximum intended inventory for the covered products. Due to the flammability of the products mentioned above, the Mount Joy facility is covered by OSHA's PSM Program and therefore required to comply with EPA's RMP Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nHolcim has developed an integrated approach to compliance through a PSM/RMP Manual. The manual describes the management system and associated procedures and documentation related to the OSHA PSM/RMP Prevention Program Level 3 el"
