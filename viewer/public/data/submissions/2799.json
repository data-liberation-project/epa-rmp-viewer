The Facility Policy\n\n\tThe employees of the AGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC - East in Brunswick are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Brunswick Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry and liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also handles pesticides, grain, feed and farm supply products.\n\n\tThe facility has the capability to receive via rail, thus, the maximum quantity stored and handled would be approximately 160,000 pounds in a 37,500 gallon railroad tank car. The largest fixed storage tank is 30,000 gallon.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.7 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\u0014 transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia on 8/28/97 that: did not cause any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, although there was minor environmental damage. This release occurred as a result of an attempted theft of the product.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
