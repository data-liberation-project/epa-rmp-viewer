The location of the facility is 500 Sebesta Road in Angleton, TX, in Brazoria County. This  summary was prepared to comply with the Risk Management Plans requirements under Section (r) of the Clean Air Act.   The facility contains or has the potential to contain 2500 pounds or more chlorine. The volume of chlorine on site is normally 4000 pounds.\n\nThis plan includes maps of the area with corresponding maps indicating the possible hazard zone under the Worst Case Scenario and an Alternative Release Scenario as required by the Clean Air Act RMP requirements in section (r) for program 3 facilities.  These maps delineate the areas that are considered hazard zones under each scenario and the area that will need to either be evacuated or have the residents or occupants sheltered in place.\n\nPSG takes many precautions to prevent releases of chlorine gases that could affect either their employees, nearby business and the public.  The precautions include on site alarm systems to warn PSG employees of a release.  In addition, there is an automatic communication system that notifies emergency 911 operators of a chlorine release.  The 911 operator then notify the local HazMat team.  PSG employees go on site a assess the leak and will take action to stop the leak when it is possible.  If the leak cannot be stopped, PSG personnel will provide information about the leak, its size and possible duration to the HazMat Team. \n\nThe most probable type of releases may occur when there is a transfer hose or washer failure in the chlorine lines. PSG keeps a  chlorine\"B\" kit on site and has trained its employees to perform repairs on small leaks.  This is to be done in conjunction with the Angleton Fire Department and HazMat Team for local companies contacted by the fire department.  All necessary spare parts that might be required to repair the anticipated types of leaks are available on sit"

Further, PSG personnel audit the facility to maintain emergency equipment, communication systems and the training status of its employees. \n\n\n\nPSG has worked with the local emergency responders such as the Fire Department, their HazMat group, the local police departments and the Local Emergency Planning Committee  (LEPC) to ensure that all parties are aware of the emergency response plan and know what to do in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  \n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to:\n\n1.Protect PSG employees, nearby businesses and the public from the potential harm of uncontrolled releases of chlorine both on and off the facility site;\n\n2.Provide information for onsite emergency responders to use to access the hazard of a     release or threatened release of chlorine;\n\n3.Establish procedures for activation of this plan and the emergency response to uncontrolled releases;\n \n4.Comply with the requirements of the Section (r) of Clean Air Act;\n\n5.Provide Emergency Response agencies with relevant information for responding to an incident at this facility;\n\n6. Facilitate the coordination of emergency communications to potentially affected residents of the community."
