              "Description": "Continental Carbonic Products Inc. is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Corporate policy dictates that facilities continuously identify methods to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of inherently safer technology and procedures. This commitment to safe and environmental sound operations is documented in the corporate policy and compliance manuals, which are available to all employees. \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accidental release prevention program and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, this facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program. Our comprehensive prevention program includes documented process safety information to ensure safe and reliable plant operation, process hazard analysis to identify and train all affected employees in the hazards associated with the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, mechanical integrity procedures to ensure adequate and proper plant maintenance. Should an accident or near miss occur, procedures are in place to thoroughly investigate the incident and take corrective action as necessary. We believe the key to preventing incidents is continuously improving our operating and prevention procedures and better educating our employees.\n\n",

The Carbon Dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into\n\nliquid form and the liquid Carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid. The\n\nfacility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid Carbon Dioxide (dry ice). Ammonia\n\nis used as the refrigerant in a closed loop Ammonia refrigeration system located on the facility. An\n\nammonia receiver stores the Ammonia refrigerant in addition to various heat exchangers,\n\ncompressors, condensers and connecting piping and valves.\n\nOur worst case scenario for ammonia system is a failure of the ammonia receiver resulting in the\n\nrelease of ammonia.The quantity of the release is estimated to be 17,850lb of ammonia over a 10\n\nminute period of time with most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a\n\nrelease and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 2.6\n\nmiles. These calculations were based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration.\" Public receptors identified within 2.6 miles of the facility include\n\nresidences, schools and commercial/industrial areas. There is an estimated population of 12,073 that\n\ncould be affected by the worst case scenario.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA guidelines. A leak from a pipe, pump or\n\nvessel was assumed to create a release rate of 200lb per minute. The atmospheric condition are\n\nassumed to be more typical of the area and the toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration\n\nis calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 0.3 miles. Again, calculations were based on the\n\nEPA's \"Risk Management Guidelines fro Ammonia Refrigeration.\" Public receptors within 0.3 miles\n\nof the facility include  commercial/industrial "
