      "SummaryText": "WILLOW SPRINGS PROCESSING STATION RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Willow Springs Processing Station (WSPS) has a strong commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Reliant Energy Field Services (REFS) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nREFS operates the WSPS located in Gregg County, Texas. The WSPS is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquified petroleum gas from a gas stream.  The cryogenic extraction plant recovers propane, butanes, pentanes, and hexanes plus from the inlet gas.  Mixed liquids product from the liquids extraction plant is stored in a pressurized storage tank prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the WSPS is a Program 1 process.\n\nThe WSPS was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n \nREFS identified one flammable liquid mixture (liquified petroleum gas) and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored.  It was determined that a single vessel of the flammable liquid mixture e"

The identification of this exceedance indicates that WSPS is a covered process with a regulated substance subject to offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios (WCS)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has defined a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.\"  A WCS analysis is required for each toxic substance in a covered process while only one WCS analysis is required for regulated flammable substances as a class.  WCSs are assumed to occur at ground level with meteorological conditions defined as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere), wind speed of 1.0 meters per second (2.2 miles per hour), and an ambient air temperature of 25\u00baC (77\u00b0F).  Topography for WCSs are distinguished between rural and urban.\n \nFlammable Substances\n \nRegulated flammable substances or mixtures containing flammable substances include both gases and volatile liquids.  The WCS assumes that the total quantity of a vapor cloud is released and detonates.  The endpoint for a WCS involving a regulated flammable substance or mixture is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  For a regulated flammable substance, consequence distance determination is based on its heat of combustion.  For regulated flammable mixtures, the component with the highest heat of combustion can be used for consequence distance determination or, if preferred, directly calculated using equation C-1 of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document (OCAGD).  The quantity of a regulated substance/mixture used to determine distance to endpoint is the largest quantity of a regulated substance/mixture in a single vessel.                                                                     \n \nThe flammable liquid mixture evaluated at the WSPS is a mixture of propane, butanes, pentan"

The largest vessel quantity of the flammable liquid mixture at the site was contained in the Product Storage Tank having the capacity of approximately 30,000  gallons.  Administrative controls have been implemented to limit the maximum quantity of flammable liquid mixture to less than 14,735 lbs.  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule, this mixture represents the facility's WCS for flammables.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure for the worst-case release of the flammable liquid mixture was calculated and determined to be 0.20 miles.  The distance to endpoint is less than the distance to any public receptors- - a mandatory criterion for all Program 1 processes.\n\nToxic Liquids and Gases\n \nToxic gases include all regulated toxic substances that are gases at ambient temperature (temperature 25\u00ba C, 77\u00b0F), even if they are stored as liquids under pressure or refrigeration.  For the consequence analysis, a gaseous release of the total quantity is assumed to occur in 10 minutes, regardless of storage conditions.   For toxic liquids, the total quantity in a vessel is assumed to be spilled onto a flat, non-absorbing surface.  For toxic liquids carried in pipelines, the quantity that might be released from the pipeline is assumed to form a pool.  Passive mitigation systems may be taken into account in consequence analysis for both toxic gases and liquids. The endpoint for air dispersion modeling to estimate the consequence distance for a release of a toxic gas and liquid is presented for each regulated toxic gas and liquid in Appendix B of the OCAGD in Exhibits B-1 and B-2, respectively.\n\nThe WSPS does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Analysis of one worst-case release scenario for all regulated toxic substances is, therefore, not required.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAn ARS describes an incident that is more likely to occur than those ci"

One ARS analysis is required for each listed toxic substance in a Program 2 or 3  process that exceeds threshold quantity while only one ARS analysis is required for all flammable substances as a class in a Program 2 or 3 process.  For ARSs, both active and passive mitigation systems can be considered.\n \nAlternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the toxic endpoint beyond the process fenceline.  Those releases that have the potential to reach the public are of the greatest concern.\n\nWSPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammables\n \nThe WSPS is a Program 1 process and is, therefore, not required to complete an ARS for regulated flammables.\n\nWSPS Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Toxics\n \nThe WSPS does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity and, in addition, is a Program 1 process.  Analysis of each regulated toxic substance is, therefore, not required.\n \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWSPS has not had any accidental releases during the past five years which meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\nSince the facility is unmanned, REFS has not implemented a site-specific emergency response plan.  The WSPS has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3).  Although Reliant does not maintain a site-specific emergency response plan, Reliant has prepared an emergency response plan for pipeline operations in accordance with USDOT requirements which includes WSPS and similar facilities."
