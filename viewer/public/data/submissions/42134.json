Madison, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.  Tyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy. \n  2. Facility Description\nTyson operates a hog slaughter and processing facility at this location.  Hogs are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems for grease and lard.  Support operations include small cold storage operations and administrative offices.  Refrigerated Processed Meats (RPM), a subsidiary of Tyson Foods, inc., is located adjacent to the slaughter and process facility.  RPM operates a food processing and smoking operation at this location.\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  This chemical is ammonia and is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n  3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Madison, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimiz"
