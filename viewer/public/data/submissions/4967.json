We will properly train, equip and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\n\nWe review our performance against our objectives and targets and update the Environmental Management System as appropriate.\n\nThis policy shall be communicated to all employees and made available to the public.\n\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity at Neste Resins is the manufacture of specialty resin.  Formaldehyde is one of several ingredients, but the only substance regulated under 40 CFR 68.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\nThe worst case release would be the result of a broken transfer line during kettle charging with the rupture occurring outside the tank storage containment area.  The maximum quantity released would be 30,000 gallons of solution that is 50% by weight formaldehyde at a spill rate of 180 gallons per minute.  The maximum quantity released to the atmosphere assuming an initial spill temperature of 65 degrees C would be 20.8 lbs/minute.  The potential distance to the toxic endpoint (point of dispersion to 0.012 mg/liter) is 0.81 miles.\n\nThe alternative scenario for formaldehyde would be the release of 1,907 lbs of formaldehyde.  The maximum quantit"

      "SummaryText": "y released to the atmosphere assuming an initial spill temperature of 65 degrees C would be 1.1 lbs/minute.  It is estimated that the release would be stopped by an employee in no more than 5 minutes.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nAll covered processes at Neste Resins are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The existing OSHA PSM-required accidental release prevention program meets nearly all RMP requirements.  Where the programs differ, the Neste Resins' program elements have been modified to incorporate RMP issues.  An example would be that the compliance audit procedures required as part of Neste's PSM program have been modified to include evaluations of the RMP implementation.  Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nNeste Resins has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor have there been any accidents which led to off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nNeste Resins has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program.  This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release.  Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Neste to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases "
