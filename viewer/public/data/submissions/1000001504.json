If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Our bulk tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons when filled to 85% capacity (max allowed by law, figured at 5.14 pounds per gallon).  We also have up to 10-1,000 gallon nurse tanks on site that would have a total of 43,690 pounds capacity.  This would give a total of 122,332 pounds total capacity.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.

This is due to security concerns as brought to light by the Homeland Security Act.  All appropriate material will be forwarded to the local first responders and LEPC's.  \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61/1 and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of our insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The state of Kansas has not yet adopted the latest version of the ANSI standard.  Our company realizes the importance of staying current with the standard and as budget allows we will budget the needed time and funds to insure that all facilities meet the new standard.  \n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.

Employees are trained on basic first aid for victims, where to evacuate too, and how to notify first responders.   \n\nWe report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations as required by The Community Right-to-Know rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process at our firm.  We are dedicated to safely serving our customers and protecting the employees that work for us.  Training, equipment and maintenance are of the highest quality and design.
