If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the unlaoding from truck, anhydrous ammonia, into our storage tanks and then to transfer from storage tanks into nurse tanks.  These nurse tanks are used by our farmer customers to apply nitrogen to their crops. The maximum quanity stored in our storage tanks is 252,450 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, our storage plant consists of two tanks one 12,000 gallon and one 30,000 gallon along with 56100 ponds of storage in our 12 nurse tanks.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 132,000 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards. The alternative release scenario based on industry records and the most likely potentail incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  All emergency processes have been cordinated with the local LEPC\n\nBecause our firm handels anhydrous ammonia, we are regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis.  These regulation along with the extensive training and standards our company uses, has led us to an excellent safety record.  We have had no reportable accidents with annhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  We are very proud of this record.  In the event we would have an ammonia release  we have an emergency response plan which discusses what our personnel are to do.  In addition the training our employees are required to have , addresses ammonia accidents and p"
