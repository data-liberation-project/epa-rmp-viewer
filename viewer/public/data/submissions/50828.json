To accomplish this, management will provide all reasonable safe guards to ensure safe working conditions.  The joint cooperation of employees and management in the observation of this policy will provide safe working conditions and acident free performance, and will be to the mutual advantage of all.\nThe Jasper Water Treatment Plant is a Drinking Water Treatment Facility for the City of Wichita Falls.  The facility has recently undergone an expansion that saw increases to both the Chlorine and Ammonia inventoriies that are on site for the Disinfection process.  The expansion also saw major advances in protecting the employees and public from the hazards presented by these two chemicals.  The plant was outfitted with new detection/alarm equipment, chemical scrubber systems, automatic shutdown systems, as well as enhanced security features.  Plant personnel were trained on all of the new systems and are monitored for Standard Operatoing Procedure compliance.\nThe Jasper Water Treatment Facility experienced its first accident/release in its history.  One of the new Ammonia pressure vessels developed a leak at a manway hatch.  Approximately 10,000 pounds of ammonia gas was released over a 17 hour period, requiring the response from the Wichita Falls Fire Department and an private chemical response firm.  An evacuation of surrounding homes was conducted by the Wichita Falls Police Department and a portion of an Interstate Highway was shutdown by the Texas Department of Transporation.  Due to the quick response by trained plant personnel and our Emergency Response Teams, there were no reported injuries, or loss of life during this incident.  Overall, this was a textbook response to a chemical release that demonstrated the affectiveness of procedures and equipment that are in place.\nThe City of Wichita Falls will continue to review and update its procedure"
