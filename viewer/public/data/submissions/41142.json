Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Moses Lake Generating Facility stores and uses aqueous ammonia (29 percent solution) with the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems as part of the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions controls for the engine-generators at the facility.  Aqueous ammonia is the only substance at the facility used in amounts equal to or greater than the ?threshold quantity? defined in 40 CFR Part 68.  Moses Lake Generating, LLC has developed and is implementing a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to ensure appropriate site management of the aqueous ammonia.  The RMP is designed to ensure the safety of its employees and the public and to protect the environment.\n\nIt is the company?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Moses Lake Generating, LLC manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, and safety devices (e.g., instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation.  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  Facility Description and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Moses Lake Facility consists of 29 engine-generator sets capable of producing up to 50.3 megawatts of electricity.  The compression ignition engines use dual fuels for combustion, with a fuel mixture of at least 5 percent No. 2 diesel fuel oil and the rest being natural gas.  Each engine is equipped with a SCR system to limit NOx emissions.  In order for the SCR systems to remove NOx from the engine exhaust ammonia, in the form of aqueous ammonia, is injected into the exhaust stream entering the SCR catalyst beds.  The "
