Roquette has adopted a Web-Based PSM/RMP technology to reduce the \"Paperwork\" cost of PSM/RMP compliance.  At the same time the Safety of the Ammonia Process has been enhanced  by Managing and Documenting PSM/RMP Compliance activities electronically.\n\nI.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Roquette America, Inc recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents is the basic responsibility of all Roquette America, Inc personnel who operate the Ammonia Process in the Cogen Facility.\n\n     The Roquette America, Inc. PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia Operating and Management Systems.  The Roquette PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based DeNOx System, It is not \"Paperwork\" Roquiette expects to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     Roquette America, Inc. believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  All members of the Operating Team have been deeply involved and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Ammonia process safely.\n\n     The Roquette America, Inc.

      "SummaryText": "ion control System (Nox removal from Stack Gas).  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as Hazardous Substance.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and Reports that are also required.\n\n\nIV.   DESCRIPTION OF THE Roquette America, Inc. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Roquette America, Inc. conducts an annual (as well as the required Tri-Annual OSHA) audit of their PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. Roquette America, Inc. considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be \"living\" documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n\n     Roquette America, Inc emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from their ammonia process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n    Roquette America, Inc provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and a Training Management System with \"one-on-one\" teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia process employee.\n\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     The Roquette Ammonia COGEN facility is new.  There have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAll Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases in a \"defensive\" manner.  They are trained to take \"Emergency Actions\" to control an ammonia release where"

The site emergency plan has been coordinated with local Public Emergency Responders as well as the Roquette Emergency Response Team..\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Roquette America, Inc recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and improvement.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" truly becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     Roquette America, Inc expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n (1)   EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:  Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program. Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in Verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n(2)    EXPANCED USE OF THEIR PSM/RMP WEB-SITE:  The Roquette America, Inc PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and  (e) written to be understood and used by both Ammonia Managers and Process Operators.  The web-site makes all information developed by the PSM/RMP Program available to all employees who have a User Name and Password.  All Roquette Cogen employees have an assigned User Name and Password. \n\n(3)  PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS: All recommendations developed during the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Storage and Use Systm].  Roquette America has evaluated each PHA recommendation.  Each recommendation has been installed and will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintent"

They are revised as often as necessary to keep them current and correct.\n\n(6)  TRAINING:  Orientation Training (both classroom and On-the-Job) is provided employees before Ammonia related work assignments are given.  Renewal training, including documented training tests are provided annually.\n\n(7)  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS:  Critical Ammonia Equipment is routinely inspected and maintained according to manufacturer?s recommendations."
