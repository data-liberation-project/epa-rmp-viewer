      "SummaryText": "Brightmark operates a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) processing facility that generates RNG from recovered biogas emitted\nby Dairy farm digesters. The digesters are fed with cow manure which in turn create biogas. Once in the digester, the manure\nis heated and decomposed, creating biogas. The biogas is then upgraded to RNG by increasing the methane content by\nremoving water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other impurities. After upgrading, the RNG is compressed and\nloaded into transportation trucks for delivery to an injection point where it enters a commercial supply pipeline. The RNG\ntransportation trucks are referred to as a \u0093virtual pipeline\u0094. The RNG is also known as biomethane. RNG is pipeline quality\nnatural gas nearly identical to traditional natural gas and can be used for heating, cooking and other processes.\nThe primary process safety hazards identified by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study include toxic gas exposure from\nH2S and overall flammable / explosive hazards from the methane within the system. The facility exceeds the PSM / RMP\nthreshold quantity of methane due to the use of RNG transportation trucks also referred to as a \u0093virtual pipeline\u0094.\nIn order to ensure safe operation of the process facility equipment, Brightmark has a Process Safety and Risk Management\nprogram. This program helps identify, and control process safety related hazards to personnel and the environment. The\nprocess safety program includes the following main elements:\n\u0095 Employee Participation\n\u0095 Process Safety Information\n\u0095 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u0095 Operating Procedures\n\u0095 Training\n\u0095 Contractor Safety\n\u0095 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u0095 Mechanical Integrity\n\u0095 Hot Work Permit\n\u0095 Management of Change (MOC)\n\u0095 Incident Investigation\n\u0095 Emergency Response & Planning\n\u0095 Compliance Audits\nThe process safety management program is supplemented by an occupational safety program to help manage other safety\nand environmental hazards based on applicable regulations and codes.
