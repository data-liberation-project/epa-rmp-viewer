These programs include both Union Carbides Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Union Carbide Institute Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 millon pounds of specialty chemical products in its various operating unit.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Institute Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the Institute Plant:  \n\n7 Ethylene Oxide              \n7 Anhydrous Ammonia        \n7 Ethylenediamine\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated flammable substances at the Institute Plant:\n\n7 1,3-butadiene      \n7 Isopentane            \n3    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.
