This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as: providing comprehensive initial and refresher personnel training, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes, and conducting drills to respond to simulated emergencies. Our objective is to implement controls to minimize the potential for releases or spills. However, if a release/spill occurs, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe prevent accidents using a structured safety management system entitled VG EHS Roapmap, Operations Management Systems, and a Safety Culture in which all employees play a role in the prevention of incidents. Our Operations Management Systems are the cornerstone for continuous improvement in our safety-related systems. These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps. Some examples are the recommendations from our safety audits and any incident investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Creek Plant has been recognized by the Vincit Group for its effective safety and health management programs. Our plant is also seen the driver for safety improvements throughout Zeco and is currently mentoring our other two sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Creek Chemical Plant, located in Chattanooga, TN, operates several processes to produce cleaning products for the food protein and waste water industries.

Although the plant is part of a larger company Vincet Group, the Zeco plant is evaluation the possibility of using the Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe EHS system meets all the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.  The system also exceeds all regulatory requirements by incorporating periodic management review of performance measurements for each practice to evaluate whether each practice is working as planned and what improvements might be made. The Zeco Plant conducts quarterly EHS audits which meets and goes beyond the regulations. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe EPA RMP area is described in greater detail below and in the Data Element Section. Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly being updated. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\n\n\nZeco encourages employees to participate in all facets of EHS management process and accident prevention. An annual plan is developed with employee participation. This includes weekly safety meetings for operations and maintenance personnel, monthly safety audits, meetings of the Emergency Spill Response Plan and most recently, a training matrix is used to access employee training needs and requirements. Employees also participate in the development and updating of operating and maintenance procedures and conducting Hazard Analyses \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Safety Director reports directly to the Zeco operations director and is the final review on \"safety\" matters relating to facilities and operations. \"Safety,\" in the current environment, encompasses a broad range of issues.

These standards consist of the applicable codes and industry standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee participation is further amplified in the Safety Committee. This safety committee meets quarterly and is represented by experienced colleagues in management and labor areas. The Plant Manager and hourly employee committee members co-chair the EHS Programs, which focuses on EHS programs and systems including security. Key EHS personnel are included in the quarterly agenda to report on on-going programs and initiatives. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Zeco Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, equipment design basis, and equipment configuration information. Specific groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining the information up-to-date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).

Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeco used a knowledge-based R3 analysis technique to perform HA's.  R3 analysis is widely recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough HA techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. This HA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team also makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HA team findings are provided to local management for resolution. Implementation of prevention/mitigation steps in response to HA findings is based on the relative risk evaluation done by the HA team. Potential hazard scenarios with the greater assigned risk receive attention first. All HA findings are tracked until they are resolved. The findings and any resolutions are documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis for each unit every five years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained for the life of the process.
