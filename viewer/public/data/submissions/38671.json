      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The DWP Santa Ynez Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  DWP prepared and submitted the RMP for the Santa Ynez facility in June 1999.  This RMP is the five year update of the June 1999 RMP.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n* Emergency response program summary.\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Santa Ynez Chlorination Station is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DWP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates the use of"

All applicable requirements of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe DWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The Santa Ynez Chlorination Station has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The Santa Ynez Chlorination Station has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Santa Ynez Chlorination Station is located at 1351 North Palisades Drive in Pacific Palisades, California.  The station serves to chlorinate water stored in the Santa Ynez Reservoir.  The treated water is then piped into the distribution network which serves parts of West Los Angeles with potable water. The station has a building which houses chlorine stored in ton containers, three weighing system for the containers, three chlorinators, and associated process piping.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of four one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Santa Ynez chlorine building.  Three of the four chlorine containers are connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the fourth is stored as a spare, not connected to the process.  The one-ton"

The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Santa Ynez Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility three times a week and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Santa Ynez facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nThere is a maximum of four chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Three ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allows the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container and the fourth is stored as a spare, not connected to the process.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine header lines to one of the two chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator would shut down the chlorine supply at the container angle valve, operating as a shut-off valve.  From the chlorinator, the gas is then pulled by vacuum to injectors which draw chlorine gas into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  The injectors are in a cabinet near the chlorination building.  The chlorine solution discharged from the injectors is diffused into the reservoir and the reservoir outlet pipeline.\n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the DWP's Los Angeles Aqueduc"

DWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nHazard Review \n\nIn 1996, a detailed hazard review was conducted for the chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The hazard review was further reviewed in April 1999.  In March 2004 a hazard review was again performed for the whole chlorination system and will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the process.

The hazard review was performed using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) technique and covered both equipment and procedures used for the chlorine handling system.  A number of equipment and procedural changes were made as part of the implementation of the recommended actions.  All the above recommendations have been evaluated and implemented by the DWP.  Additional 12 changes to further improve chlorine safety were identified in March 2004, when the hazard review was completed for the facility. It is expected that these recommendations will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorine system."
