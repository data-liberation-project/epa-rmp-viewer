BCG is subject to USEPA's Accidental Release Risk Management Program (RMP) rules, due to onsite quantities of the listed flammable substances propyne and propadiene (components of MAPP gas and Thomas gas) in excess of the 10,000-pound rule threshold.\nRMP rules require LCC to conduct a hazard assessment at each facility, including compilation of a five-year history of relevant accidental releases, offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to determine the area of concern (AOC) impacted by hypothetical releases, and evaluation of population size and sensitive receptors in the projected impact areas.  Based upon the results of this hazard assessment, LCC is implementing programs to prevent accidental releases and respond to emergencies, as well as a management system to ensure compliance.  Elements of the plant RMP are summarized below.\n7 The facility has had no releases of flammable gas within the last five years that adversely affected facilities or people offsite.\n7 For the worst-case release (explosion) of 53,200 pounds of flammable gas, OCA using USEPA guidance equations predicts that the AOC will extend 1,607 feet from the storage tank location. Census data reveal that 124 people reside in the AOC, which includes residences, other businesses,a hospitol, and a school.   No sensitive environmental receptors are within the AOC. \n7 For a less severe alternative release (fireball) of 6,926 pounds of flammable gas, OCA predicts that the AOC will extend 625 feet just past the nearest residence offsite. Only four people are estimated to reside within the AOC, which includes no sensitive environmental receptors.\n7 The affected process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and as such is subject to the full RMP requirements under rule Program 3.\n7 The facility accident prevention program is based upon design, operation and maintenance guidance in NFPA 58, the Liquified "
