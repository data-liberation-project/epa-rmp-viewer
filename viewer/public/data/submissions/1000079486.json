Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nFour Star Fruit has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Four Star Fruit continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Four Star Fruit's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Four Star Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\nFour Star Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed,"
