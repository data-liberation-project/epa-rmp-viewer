The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below estab"

In DX evaporators, high pressure liquid is supplied from the high pressure receivers directly to the evaporators. Each evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporators. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporators and is returned to the main suction accumulators.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the evaporator coils, the system includes a plate and frame heat exchanger. Low temperature liquid is piped from one flooded accumulator to the plate and frame heat exchanger where it flows through the channels in the plates and absorbs the heat from the water/glycol mixture on the opposite side of each plate. As the liquid refrigerant absorbs heat, it vaporizes into a low temperature gas which returns to the supplying accumulator and is piped back to the main suction accumulators. \n\n\n\nAny remaining liquid in the main suction accumulators falls to the bottom of the vessels and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel.

      "SummaryText": " high side of each system relieves at 250 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 200 psig or 150 psig. All pressure relief valves  for both systems are piped to the diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nEach main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\n\n \n\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\n\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at Four Star Fruit consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. The systems are neither interconnected nor co-located relative to each other. As such, the refrigeration systems at Four Star Fruit are treated as two (2) independent processes.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nFour Star Fruit has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Four Star Fruit facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the proce"

These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFour Star Fruit has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nFour Star Fruit's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38 \n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nFour Star Fruit has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Four Star Fruit continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Four Star Fruit's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Four Star Fruit's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nFour Star Fruit has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed,"

      "SummaryText": " the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Four Star Fruit has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Four Star Fruit now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Four Star Fruit employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Four Star Fruit will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety.\n\n"
