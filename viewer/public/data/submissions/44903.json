      "SummaryText": "The regulated substance handled at the Paul B. Krebs Water Treatment Plant is liquid chlorine which is used for disinfection of drinking water.  There have been no reportable accidents in the past five years that resulted in personal injury or property damage.  Inventories are kept to a minimum.  Plant operators have been trained with regard to the nature of the chemical and in the proper handling of the chemical containers and use of connectors and feed equipment.  Process equipment inspections are performed daily for the purpose of preventing accidental release of chlorine.  Leak repair kits and SCBA's are kept on site for rapid response to emergency situations.  Leak detection devices are in use.  The local EMA has been notified in writing of the chemicals used at the plant.  Chemical storage and related equipment is inside an enclosed building with a chlorine scrubber to limit release in the case of accident and protect containers.  EPA RMP Comp predicts worse case scenario to have a toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles from the plant, whereas the alternative case has a radius of 0.2 miles from the plant."
