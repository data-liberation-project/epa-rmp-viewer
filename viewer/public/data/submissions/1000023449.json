Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Institute personnel.  Release-reporting procedures are included in Institute's manufacturing process units which prescribe immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the U.S. Coast Guard, the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (WVDEP), and the state and local emergency planning centers (EPCs),  as required by federal, state, and county protocol.  The plant maintains an emergency response team with appropriate training and equipment to respond to releases of toxic or flammable materials inside the plant.  The plant also has mutual-aid agreements with local fire departments for response to various emergencies including chemical releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Institute Plant is located eight miles west of Charleston, WV on the north bank of the Kanawha River.  The site has a total area of 460 acres, which is owned by Bayer CropScience.  Portions of the site are leased to Union Carbide (Dow), Praxair, and Reagent Chemical Company.\n\nBayer CropScience, an agricultural chemical based company, operates a multi-product, multi-process chemical plant.  The plant has four basic manufacturing units along with several other production facilities primarily responsible for producing raw materials used in the manufacture of agricultural chemicals.  The principal products produced at the Institute site are LARVIN brand thiodicarb, RHODIMET AT-88, and Carbosulfan.  Praxair, Catalyst Refiners, and Reagent Chemical operate their own facilities inside the site.\n\nBayer CropScience currently has three production processes at this site th"

The second and third processes, Methyl Isocyanate and Phosgene/Chlorine, have recently been shut down with intent to exit the business, although two RMP-covered chemicals, chlorine and chloroform, remain stored in the units at this time.   A fourth process, Aldicarb, is no longer subject to the RMP rule, as the process has been permanently shut down with intent to exit the business.\n\nThe RHODIMET AT-88 facility produces methionine hydroxy analog that is used in poultry feed supplies.  Ammonia is used as a raw material for this process.  The Phosgene/Chlorine process, which is now permanently shut down, is currently storing the raw material chlorine with intent to sell it back to the supplier.  Chloroform, which was previously used as a coolant in the Phosgene/Chlorine process, is currently being stored in the tank farm area of the Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) process, which is also now permanently shut down. The chloroform is expected to be sold back to the supplier or to be used elsewhere in industry.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Institute Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We maintain a process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the various covered RMP processes are all considered in the evaluation.  The various levels of protection  that have been incorporated "

Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees, the community and the environment to serious hazards.\n\nThe processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control and prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the processes to identify potential hazards and implementing procedures, installing control devices and systems, and providing training to control those hazards.  The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary\n\nIn addition to skilled operators, all of the processes have computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.   The control systems are equipped with redundant safety systems which are designed to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded.   All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers and flares to neutralize emissions from the process and minimize potentially harmful releases to the atmosphere.  \n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases.  In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidenta"

      "SummaryText": "l releases, in the event that an accidental release does occur, it is formally investigated to determine the root causes and to prescribe corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring in the future.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Institute Site had one accidental release from an RMP-covered process that meets the RMP incident reporting criteria during the last five years. In this incident, which occurred on November 2, 2006, a flanged joint in an unloading line from a railcar containing chloroform developed a leak, which resulted in a release of approximately 1500 pounds of chloroform to the surrounding ground area.  The spill was contained and the contaminated soil was removed and properly disposed without injury or further incident.  This accident is noted here because it occurred within the five year period time frame; it was reported in two previous resubmissions.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Institute Plant maintains an on-site  emergency response team to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, medical, chemical spills, and natural disasters and rescue emergencies.  It also participates in local fire and industrial mutual aid systems.  The Institute Plant has a dedicated in-plant Emergency Operations Center capable of modeling events using real-time meteorological data, trained incident commanders, and a trained and state-certified emergency squad on site at all times.  Additionally, a plant-wide notification system is in place in the event of an emergency.  The plant has an onsite dispensary and medical professional as well as full-coverage with Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are many operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve the safe operation of the Bayer CropScience facilities.  These occur as a result of the periodic risk-based process hazard assessment review process, as described above.\n\n"
