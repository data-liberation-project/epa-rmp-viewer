      "SummaryText": "Federated Co-ops, Inc.Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\nOur facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center.  We store and distribute a wide variety of Ag\n\nsupplies, anhydrous ammonia being one of those products.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck\n\nand stored on site.  We refill 1000 and 1500 gallon nurse tanks for area growers they use as a source of nitrogen\n\nfor their crops.  This location has an 18,000 gallon storeage tank when filled will hold approximately\n\n80,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  We also have 28-1000 gallon nurse tanks and 4-1500 gallon\n\nnurse tanks.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nFederated Co-ops, Inc. has developed a safety Committee involving employees from all locations.  This is to\n\nensure involvement on all levels.  Federated Co-ops, Inc.'s goal is to have an accident free work environment.\n\nWe hold monthly monthly safety training sessions to instill this in our employees.  Before any employee \n\nworks with anhyrous ammonia or any sensitive material they are required to complete safety and handling \n\ntraining.  The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and hands-on\n\ntraining.  Location managers are directly involved to make sure training is complete.\n\n\n\nA documented safety equipment check is required each time a fill is made.  Checks include valves, hoses,\n\nbleeder vales, guages, water supply, gloves and goggles, tires, wheel bearings, relief valves and general\n\ncondition of the equipment.  These checks involve a complete check of the equipment being filled including\n\nall safety equipment is in working order.  The Safety Director is responsible for checking these for accuracy.\n\nAny equipment found to be defective is put out of service immediately or corrected on the spot.\n\n\n\nOur storeage tank is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves and hose break-aways.\n\nThese measures are in place to stop the flow immediately in the event of hose "

      "SummaryText": "or line failure.  All valves\n\nare locked when not in use.  Our facility is inspected on a regular basis to ensure safety.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario would involve the total loss of product in the storeage tank.  When filled to capasity\n\nthis would amount to 80,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Results of the RMP*Comp show that total\n\nrelease over a 10-minute period would have off-site impacts.  Federated Co-ops, Inc. has never had any kind \n\nof release at any of its storeage facilities and hope this record continues.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site.\n\nThe alternative release using RMP*Comp with a 5 minute release at 1000 pounds per minute would have some\n\noff-site impact.  Again Federated has never had a release at any storeage facility.\n\n\n\nFive year History\n\nThere have never been any accidents at any of our sites causing death, injury or property damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is Federated's policy to notify the local fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preperation for this, we have coordinated with all the local response agencies by providing information and tours if needed to ensure that they are familiar with our facility.  This will help to\n\nensure that our community has a strategy for responding to the threat posed by an ammonia release."
