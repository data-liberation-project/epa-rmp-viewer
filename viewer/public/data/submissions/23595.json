The owners, management, and employees of the Seward Branch are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work witrh the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION. The facility is located approximately five miles north of Seward Kansas. The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizer for retail sale to producers of agricultural products. The maxium storage of anhydrous ammonia at this location is 294,400 pounds, which includes the main storage tanks as well as nurse trailers.\n\n3. WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total amount of anhydrous ammonia from the main storage tanks. The maxium release would be 233,200 pounds, the distance to end point would be 2.6 miles with 70 people affected.\n\n4. ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO. The alternate release scenario is a release from a ruptured transfer hose. The release of approximatley 2400 pounds would travel 0.3 miles to end point effecting about 4 people.   \n\n5. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM. The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries \"AG-21\" member. Ag-21 is a program that is enviromental driven. This Coop strives to go above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customers, employees and the enviroment\n\n6. FIVE YEAR ACCIDIENT HISTORY. There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia withen the past five years.\n\n7. EMERGENCY RESPOSE PROGRAM. The facility has coordinated with local responders. \n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. The Coop's Safety Committee which is comprised of a representative from each Department or Branch. This committee tours a Branch of Department once per month. All areas are toured a least once in a twelve mon"
