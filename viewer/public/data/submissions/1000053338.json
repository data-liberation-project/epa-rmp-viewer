Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\n     The management and employees of Prairieland FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Scotland County Fire Protection District, the Scotland County Local Emergency Planning Committee, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substance handled.\n\n\n\n     The primary activity at the facility, which is located at the junction of US HWY 136 and County Road U, is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n4. The accidental release program.\n\n      This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\n\ncodes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage  and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K-61-1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".

In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Scotland County Fire Protection District and the Scotland County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and the LEPC.\n\n\n\n7. Planned  changed to improve safety.\n\n     Safety Improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n"
