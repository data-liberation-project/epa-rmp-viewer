The requirements, codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A-H, require any facility that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process to comply with the requirements of the Risk Management Program and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). \n\n\n\nRegulated flammable and toxic substances and their corresponding threshold quantities (TQ) (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) are identified for the purpose of determining applicability. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable), the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Associations (NFPA) flammable hazard rating of 4. Where toxic substances are found in greater than one percent by weight of a mixture, only the weight of the toxic substance is considered in threshold determination. Table 1 lists the regulated substances and the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe onsite in a covered process at the Shintech Louisiana, LLC Shintech Plaquemine Plant Complex (Shintech). The Complex currently incorporates the following facilities: Shintech Plaquemine Plant 1 (SPP-1), Shintech Plaquemine Plant 2 (SPP-2), Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 1 (HAPF-1), and Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 2 (HAPF-2).  Shintech is currently in the process of constructing a Hydrochloric Acid Production Furnace 3 (HAPF-3) and a Plaquemine Ethylene Plant 1 (PEP-1).\n\n\n\nTable 1\n\nRegulated RMP Chemical\n\nType\n\nCAS Number\n\nRMP TQ (in lbs)\n\nTotal Quantity Capable of Being Present in a Process (in lbs)\n\nLocation of Process\n\nChlorine"

The facility is designed as a vertically integrated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing facility that also produces intermediate products, including chlorine (and caustic soda as a byproduct), ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride monomer, and hydrochloric acid.This facility has been designed in a manner that minimizes the potential for accidental releases. Shintech is committed to operating this facility in a manner that is safe for the plant workers, the public, and the environment. Shintech has many years of experience and an excellent environmental and safety track record in the production of polyvinyl chloride. Shintech strives to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, its neighbors, and others who may be affected by activities at the facility, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. Shintech has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter 59).

A fundamental part of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the facility. The facility utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has well-trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the release. The facility has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting and emergency rescue. In addition to handling the release, the facility is also participating in established communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release. Through the coordination with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the facility has the ability to provide emergency notification to the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Develop and Implement a Management System (CFR 68.15)\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator shall develop a management system to oversee the implementation of risk management pro"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\n2.3.9 Safe Work Practices\n\n      \n\nThe facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control welding and other spark-producing activities, and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n2.3.10 Management of change:\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator shall establish and implement written procedures to manage changes to proc"

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\n* Release detection\n\n* Area ambient air monitoring system.\n\n* Automated control systems\n\n* Process relief valves to prevent overpressure damage to equipment;\n\n* Scrubbers to neutralize chemical releases;\n\n* Manual and automatic valves to permit isolation of vessels;\n\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature);\n\n* Dikes to contain liquid releases;\n\n* Release mitigation systems (water spray systems);\n\n* Fire suppression and extinguishing systems; and\n\n* Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\n2.3.15 Hot Work Permit:\n\n\n\nThe owner/operator shall issue a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.\n\n\n\nThe permit shall document that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations; it shall indicate the dates authorized for hot work; and identify the object on which hot work is to be performed.
