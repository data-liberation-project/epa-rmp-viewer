In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the refrigeration contractor (C&L Refrigeration, (800) 901-4822) and the fire department (San Bernardino County Fire Department, (909) 829-4441) for assistance as necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses, Seismic Assessments, and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  World Class Distribution has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.

Operations and preventative maintenance is conducted by the refrigeration contractor.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWorld Class Distribution has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the PSM/RMP/CalARP regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n- Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n- Written procedures for operating and maintaining the processes;\n- Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n- Investigating releases and near misses and implementing measures to prevent recurrence; and\n- Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations. \n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's fi"

Compressors C1-C4 also receive medium temp suction (economizer suction) from the Accumulator / Flash Economizer for increased efficiency. Compressor C5 is a swing compressor and can pull suction from any one of the 4 vessels. Compressor C6 pulls medium temp suction from the Accumulator / Flash Economizer. Compressors C7-C8 pull high temp suction from the Accumulator. The Compressors increase the pressure of the ammonia vapor through the discharge port of the machine. The Compressors send high-pressure discharge vapor to the Underfloor Heat Exchanger and Evaporative Condensers.

This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only trained operators / refrigeration contractor are permitted to perform system operations.  World Class Distribution has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nWorld Class Distribution is located at 343 S. Lena Rd. in San Bernardino, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage and distribution of grocery products.  The system uses a maximum of 25,000 pounds of ammonia.  A description of how the process operates is presented below:  \n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the High Pressure Receiver to the Accumulator / Flash Economizer (ACC1) and to the Dock and Temp Evaporators. The High Pressure Receiver also sends liquid ammonia to the Compressors for liquid injection oil cooling.  \n\nAt the Accumulator / Flash Economizer, the temperature of the liquid is lowered by the medium temperature suction prior to being fed to the rest of the system.
