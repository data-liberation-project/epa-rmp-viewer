The intent of the program is to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, accidental releases by stating policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other areas addressed in the federal standard.\r\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nBOR implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are maintained to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\r\nThe YDP staff are trained and conduct drills and exercises to quickly implement shelter-in-place response activities in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to an accidental release is also coordinated with Rural Metro Fire Department, law enforcement, and emergency management.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\nThe YDP utilizes chlorine (the regulated substance) as a disinfectant, necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms, and other aquatic life.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving extremely hazardous substances. Process safety information includes chlorine information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\r\nThe BOR verifies that the treatment plant (YDP) compli"

In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine system.\r\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations have been resolved.\r\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong RMP program is maintained, implemented, and followed by appropriate personnel.\r\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP/PSMP files.\r\nManagement staf"
