      "SummaryText": "\n     An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) describes policies and procedures necessary to minimize hazards to human safety and health and to the environment from fires, explosions, releases of chemicals, severe weather or other accidents.  A written plan is necessary to keep track of all emergency procedures and provisions.  It is also easier to ensure training is completed and is consistent for all employees when an Emergency Action Plan is in writing.  An Emergency Action Plan must contain emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; description of rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to preform them; the prefered means of reporting fires and other emergencies; names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan.  The written plan also includes all the MSDS sheets for the products that we carry.  The purpose of this business is to buy and sell grain, and to retail other farm related supplies and services, including bulk fuels and anhydrous ammonia.  This is the plan for the FARMERS COOPERATIVE  ELEVATOR COMPANY, Everly, Iowa.  68.185  \n     Our work is year round.  Normal operations, (January through December) are Monday through Saturday noon.

This would include contractors, grain inspecors, state inspectors and others doing work at the facility.  The vistors log would help the EC in locating these personnel in the event of an emergency.  In the event of an emergency the EC  would be ale to assemble his employees to the rendezvous point which is north of the scale, and between the office and the feedmill.  At this time a head count would be taken; this would help the EC in locating personnel still missing and also locating personnel signed in the log book if any.  At this time the EC would be able to secure the area and asign duties, making sure curious onlookers, the press, and unauthorized employees do not enter the dangerous area.  The EC would coordinate outside response assembling the appropriate personnel to take care of the situation.  Once the situation is under control it is imparative that the same accident does not happen again.  Steps must be taken to correct the problem.  Any emergency equipment used, should be be replaced, or cleaned and repaired and returned to its proper position.  If replacement is not practical make other arrngements before resuming operations, and advise all personnel of the change.  APP.A\n     In a worst case scenario, the release of 110,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a 10 minute time period, would release 11,000 pounds per minute.

An adequate and accessible water supply, such as an eye wash+deluge shower or an open container with at least 150 gallons of CLEAN water is required.  \n           B.  Gloves and goggles must be worn when handling anhydrous ammonia.  Never wear contact lenses when working with anhydrous ammonia. \n            C.  Detach the nurse tank from towing vehicle and chock the wheels.  Always work  upwind when handling or transfering anhydrous ammonia.\n     2.  Make sure main liquid, liquid return, and vapor valves on the storage tank are open.\n     3.  Connect all liquid and vapor hoses fron the riser to the nurse tank valves.  Handle valves by the BODY, NOT by the valve HANDLES.  Tighten all fittings by hand and close bleeder valves.\n     4.  Open valves on the nurse tank and then open valves on the riser.  Open valves slowly.\n     5.  Start the pump to fill the tank.\n     6.  Once liquid BEGINS coming through the 85% FIXED liquid level gauge, the tank is at its maximum RECOMMENDED filling level.  Shut pump off.  Close liquid and vapor valves starting at the riser first, and the the hose ends, and finally the tank itself.  Open bleeder valves to bleed off the liquid and vapor between hose ends and the tank.\n     7.  Once product is bleed off, disconnect hose end valves from nurse tank valves.  Return hose ends to there secure holding compartment.  Replace the cover caps and remove the wheel chocks.   \n     An alternate case scenario, could possibly be a hose rupture of a transfer semi deliverinjg a load to our storage tank.

(Scenario did not happen and is prepared for demonstration only)  68.165(b)\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA EMERGENCIES\nAny accidential or unintentional release of ammonia to the atmosphere is an emergency.  The seriousness depends on the amount released and the number of persons, animals or crops in the danger zone.  Most common accidents happen for the following reasons:\n     1.  Broken riser pipes caused by driving off without disconnecting hoses.\n     2.  Ruptured hoses caused by using faulty or damaged hoses.  \n     3.  Ruptured hoses caused by hydrostatic valves not operating properly.\n     4.  Defective valves or inoperative excess flow valves.\n     5.  Collision or upset truck or nuses tank.

Exposure to high gas concentrations may lead to temporary blindness and severe tissue damage.  Contact with the liquid can produce severe frostbite or freezing, chemical burns and blindness.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with eye disease.  \nSKIN:  Liquid solutions and high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can cause blistering or first- and second- degree burns.  Rapid evaporation of the liquid and chemical reaction with the skin's moisture will cause freezing of the tissue followed by caistic burn.  Severe injuries can be fatal.\nINHALATION:  The odor of ammonia, which can be detected at 1-50 ppm, serves as an excellent warning. Accidental exposure to high concentrations (i.e., 400 ppm and above) can cause severe irritation of the respiratory system such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Breathing concentrations of 5,000 ppm has been reported to cause lung inflamationand death by asphyxiation.  Continued exposure to lower concentrations of the gas cause irritation to mucous membranes and upper respiratory tractand possible damage to the lungs.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with impared kidney, liver, or pulmonary function.  \nINGESTATION:  Can produce corrosion and inflamation of the esophagus, gastritis, abdominal spasms, nausea, faintness, and bluish skin.  Other possible effects are esopheal ulcers that can result in strictures and in gastric, duodenal and stenosis.  \nTOXICTY VA"
