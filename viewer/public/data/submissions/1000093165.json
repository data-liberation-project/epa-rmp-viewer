      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nGulf Coast Growth Ventures LLC (GCGV) is committed to worker and public safety and protecting the environment.  GCGV is a joint venture between affiliates of SABIC and ExxonMobil, where an ExxonMobil affiliate is the operator (EMOP).  The facility has four main process areas: Utilities, Polyethylene, Monoethylene Glycol (MEG), and Olefins.  All areas of this facility are anticipated to start up by year end of 2021.\n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program in place at the GCGV site is outlined in more detail below.  EPA's Program 3 and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard have been implemented across the site.  In addition, EMOP has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) at the GCGV site.  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's Program 3 as part of the overall system.  OIMS has been demonstrated as equivalent to ISO 14001, thus serving as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees and contractors participate in process safety management and accident prevention activities and training.  Examples of employee participation range from writing, updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to the information created as part of the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nGCGV creates and maintains numerous technical documents which inform and guide employees so they can ensure safe operation of each process area.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe GCGV site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

      "SummaryText": "Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that controls are in place to manage these hazards.  New projects that add facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with the facilities are installed as part of the project.  EMOP primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, an adaptation by ExxonMobil affiliates of widely used industry methodologies, to perform these evaluations.  The HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a PHA team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are appropriate.  The PHA team's findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Mitigation options are identified and evaluated.  Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nGCGV maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and amended.  EMOP has identified GCGV site operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions).  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit as well as other personnel to use to safely perform their jo"

New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  Operations and mechanical personnel receive refresher training to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nEMOP has put procedures in place to ensure that contractors at the GCGV site (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform EMOP of any hazards that they find during their work.  Additionally, EMOP monitors contractor performance to ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nEMOP conducts a PSSR for new or modified facilities at GCGV as required.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nEMOP has implemented a mechanical integrity program at the GCGV site to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  This program includes: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nEMOP has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include control of entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work perm"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, process operating conditions, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEMOP will investigate incidents at the GCGV site that result in, or reasonably could result in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team will document its findings, develop recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forward these results to GCGV and EMOP management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP programs are functioning properly and GCGV is in compliance with all applicable regulations, EMOP will periodically conduct audits.  The results of the audit will be used to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the program and regulations are being implemented.  Compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years by EMOP's affiliate personnel from other ExxonMobil sites, building teams with individuals who are considered experts in the safety and environmental fields.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe GCGV site is located in Gregory, San Patricio County, Texas.

The GCGV site has regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the MEG unit produces ethylene oxide which is converted to monoethylene glycol.  The entire site is considered one covered process for purposes of this plan.  The number of full time employees in the RMP report is based on the number of EMOP employees, as the operator of GCGV, and excludes employees that are shared resources with EMOP affiliates.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the GCGV site will have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The GCGV systems are designed to (1) prevent the release, (2) quickly detect a release, (3) contain/control a release and (4) reduce the consequences of, or mitigate, a release.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nGCGV does not currently have any accidents in its history because the site is new. There are no accidents in the past 5 years that would require reporting under the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEMOP maintains a written emergency response program for the GCGV site which it will supplement with training.  This is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The emergency response program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a regulated substance is accidentally released.  EMOP maintains a volunteer fire brigade at the GCGV site, comprised of employees, for the purpose of prevention, controlling, containing and suppressing industrial fires or chemical releases.  The overall emergency response program for GCGV is coordinated with the Coastal Plain Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
