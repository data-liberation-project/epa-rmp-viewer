Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThe Facility is submitting this to reflect the Helena RMP Program.  All sections of the Facility RMPr have been updated.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural fertilizer retail sale and distribution.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a third party owned and operated cargo truck.  The cargo truck Operator transfers anhydrous ammonia from the cargo truck to a 60,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel (PV). \n\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the PV to nurse tanks at the point of retail sale to the end user (i.e. Grower/Farmer).  Trained Process Operators perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.    \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Fertilizer & Logistics Manager implements the risk management plann"

The Fertilizer & Logistics Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Facility will address each recommendation listed in the December 2024 process hazard analysis (PHA). In summary, the PHA recommendations include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u0095\tImplement the Helena RMPr program;\n\u0095\tReplace hydrostatic relief valves that are expired and/or are rated greater than the process MAWP;\n\u0095\tReplace the damaged pressure relief valve on the compressor;\n\u0095\tReplace expired liquid and vapor transfer hoses;\n\u0095\tAdjust installation of the breakaway devices to be in accordance with the Manufacturer's installation instructions;\n\u0095\tInstall a pressure gauge on the discharge side of the liquid pump;\n\u0095\tPerform and document a leak test on the underground piping;\n\u0095\tObtain and maintain historical Operating Procedures Annual Certifications and Mechanical Integrity records;\n\u0095\tReplace faded NFPA labels on the PVs;\n\u0095\tCoordinate emergency notification with response agencies; and\n\u0095\tUpdate the Facility RMP program to reflect the EPA RMP rule changes published on May 2024.    \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility compli"
