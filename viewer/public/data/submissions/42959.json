If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Pettis County Emergency Management Agency, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.  The primary activity at the facility is the distribution of drinking water to the community.  Chlorine is stored in tanks designed for that purpose.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Sedalia abidies by all pertinent State of Missouri Regulation related to Chlorine to guard against accidntal releases of chlorine at the water treatment plan, and if they do occur, notify all applicable response agencies to minimize the harm to the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n4.  Five-Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program.  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of chlorine takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  Safety improvement is a ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the conditions of the facility.  There are no specfic safety recommendations regarding the storage or the use of chlorine for implementation at this time."
