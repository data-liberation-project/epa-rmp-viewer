      "SummaryText": "At the Kentucky River Station (KRS), Kentucky American Water (KYAW) handles chlorine and ammonia for the purpose of disinfecting and treating drinking water.  OSHA and USEPA consider chlorine and ammonia as hazardous chemicals.  The hazards of these chemicals make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessaryhuman exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is KYAW policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner chlorine and ammonia are handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan is based upon OSHA 1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans) and 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response) and experience obtained from community emergency drills.  The facility's emergency response plan is reviewed annually and audited once per 3 years.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must be updated and resubmitted every 5 years and/or within 30 days of any change that requires changing the process hazard analysis, the Offsite Consequence Analysis, or USEPA RMP Prevention program.  If a new regulated chemical is introduced above a threshold quantity, a revised submittal is required no later than the date the chemical is first present.  If the inventory of chemicals drops below the USEPA RMP thresholds, a frvised RMP regirstation indicating the change must be submitted within 6 months.\n\n\n\nThe Kentucky River Station water treatment plant has had no reportable releases of ammonia or chlorine in the last 5 years."
