Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nGlenn Fertilizers, Willows has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations of the Clean Air Act in June 1999. Glenn Fertilizers, Willows is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Glenn Fertilizers, Willows staff is highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely converting and storing anhydrous ammonia and storing and distributing aqueous ammonia. storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\nGlenn Fertilizers, Willows has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Conversion System and the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Glenn Fertilizers, Willows?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGlenn Fertilizers, Willows is located at 6504 Highway 99, Willows, California in the county of Glenn. The primary activity at the Facility is the conversion of anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia, storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia used for conversion is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000 gallon storage tank (bullet) and one 15,000 gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 150,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 125,000 gallon abo"

The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 24% active ingredient by weight, is 390,000 pounds. \n\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \n\n-Risk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Glenn Fertilizers, Willows has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an anhydrous or aqueous ammonia release:\n   \n   -Automatic/Manual Shutdown\n   -Well designed Relief System.\n   -The history of the Glenn Fertilizers, Willows (i.e., no CalARP-applicable anhydrous or aqueous ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. \n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "\n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Glenn Fertilizers, Willows to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\nThe facility?s maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 150,000 lbs.  Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity for EPA RMP and Cal/OSHA PSM.  The 500 lbs state threshold for the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program is also exceeded.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to CalARP Program Level 3 and EPA RMP Program Level 3. \n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n   -Process Safety Information\n   -Process Hazard Analysis\n   -Operating Procedures\n   -Training\n   -Mechanical Integrity\n   -Management of Change\n   -Pre-Startup Safety Review\n   -Compliance Audits\n   -Incident Investigation\n   -Employee Participation\n   -Hot Work Permit\n   -Contractors\n\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Business Emergency Plan. See EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM below.\n\nThe facility?s charge of aqueous ammonia is 390,000 lbs.  Therefore, it is over the 20,000 lbs threshold (20% or greater concentration) for EPA RMP and the 500 lbs (all concentrations) state threshold for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  Glenn Fertilizers, Willows is not subject to Cal/OSHA PSM or Program 3 requirement due to the fact that the concentration of aqueous ammonia managed at the Facility is 24% and the Cal/OSHA PSM threshold quantity of aqueous ammonia is only for concentrations greater than 44%. For the reasons mentioned above, the Aqueous Ammonia Storage Tank is subject to CalARP Program Level 2 and EPA RMP Program Level 2.\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Prevention Program 2 e"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of ammonia at Glenn Fertilizers, Willows in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nGlenn Fertilizers, Willows is not a First Responder.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Glenn Fertilizers, Willows will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. Glenn Fertilizers, Willows has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders.\nAn Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets the requirements of the CCR Title 8 ?3220 is in place.\n\n7. External Events Analysis Information\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, ?2745.7(q); the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:  \n\n-The types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.  \n   \n   During the June 2009 PHA a broad list of external events was considered by the Team.  General events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia were addressed.  The External Events that were considered credible include, but are not limited to, earthquake, vandalism, sabotage, external fire, human error/misoperation, and vehicle impact. \n\n-The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the process was designed.\n   \n   A safety walk-down was performed June 4th, 2009.
