At the Pontchartrain Plant, the policies are implemented through the Pontchartrain Plant Process Management Manual (PMM).  This manual is available to all employees through hard copies and also through on-line computer networks. In addition, the Pontchartrain Plant Emergency Manual lays out the complete Emergency Response program for the site.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant consists of 1132 acres, located in St John the Baptist Parish between the unincorporated areas of LaPlace and Reserve.  About 200 acres of the property are used for manufacturing areas, 590 acres are leased for cattle grazing, 30 acres are leased for recreation, and the remainder is set aside for wildlife habitat and future manufacturing needs.  A portion of the area used for manufacturing is occupied by DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC.  The DuPont Performance Elastomers facilities are considered to be a separate \"stationary source\" for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant site consists of two manufacturing processes:  \n\n*  Paraphenylene Diamine\n*  Isophorone Diamine\n\nIn the production of these products, anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance and is used as raw material.\n\nOn site storage of ammonia railcars is also treated as a separate process for the purposes of 40 CFR part 68.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC \nPREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DuPont Pontchartrain Plant processes follow the requirements of DuPo"
