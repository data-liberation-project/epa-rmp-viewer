The Facility Policy\n\n    The owners, Management, and employees of LaPorte Co. Co-op, Buchanan Branch are committed to\n     the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur,\n     the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release\n     and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility receives & stores grain from farmers and stores and blends fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 680,000 pounds in the storage tank, rail cars and nurse tanks.\n     The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 160,000 pounds.\n \n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The Facility is in compiance with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),\n     29CFR190.11, \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the State of Michigan  code\n     R408.17801 (Revised June 2000) Paragraph (1910.111).\n     The OSHA standard is refrenced in this RMP registration form, see section 8.3(b).        \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused\n     any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there\n     been any accidental releases resulting in off-site death, injury or environmental damage.  There was\n     a release of approximately 4335 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a 1000 gallon portable tank on\n     03/06/2002 caused by tampering by theives.  There were no personal injuries.\n\n5. The emergency action  program.\n\n   a. The facility is included in the communit"
