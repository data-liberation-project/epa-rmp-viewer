Jarden Zinc Products is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled. We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  The regulated substance at our facility is involved in a single use.  Chlorine is used for wastewater treatment.\r\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 360,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the calculations derived from the RMP*Comp software program supplied by EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lbs of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of >25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\r\n\r\nOne or more alternative release scenarios have been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.\r\n\r\nOne alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from Rail Car Station #1 or #2 in the Chlorine Storage proc"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps. Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nJarden Zinc Products maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What-if\" Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Jarden Zinc Products maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nJarden Zinc"

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nJarden Zinc Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Jarden Zinc Products to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training regarding the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Jarden Zinc Products.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nJarden Zinc Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nJarden Zinc Products believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation to the RMP rule in particular information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Jarden Zinc Products has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\n5.
