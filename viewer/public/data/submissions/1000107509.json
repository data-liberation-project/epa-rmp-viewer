The following list describes some of the improvements which have been made as a result of these investigations:\n-Tank level alarms and gauges improvements.\n- Improvement to the mechanical Integrity program by the introduction of a new software program.\n- Upgraded secondary containment in tank farms.\n- Improvements and additional equipment for the scrubber system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\tThe Smyrna plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public, and the environment.  This plan includes personnel safety, evacuation plans, and community emergency response notification procedures. The emergency response plan is coordinated with local emergency responders (e.g., the fire department).  This includes annual meetings and plant visits with community responders, so that they are aware of the hazards of the processes.   This coordination and communication ensure that the public is quickly notified, when necessary, and that action is promptly taken to minimize the consequences of a release."

Audits are performed by an EHS team that is knowledgeable in the processes but is independent of our facility to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\tThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of the facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error.  In addition to the prevention program, Compass has safety features built into the design of the facility that help to ensure safe process operation for the employees, the public and the environment.  These safety features may contain, or control a release, detect a release or reduce the consequences of a release.  They may also prevent a release by providing strict engineering design standards for process equipment.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes in our facility:\n- Release detection devices, level controls.\n- Procedures require a plant employee be present during loading and unloading, \n to monitor operations.\n- Valves to permit isolation of the process.\n- Automated notification systems for some process parameters, (e.g., high level, high pressure).\n- Manual shutdown controls located in the control room.\n- Diked areas designed to contain a release and prevent its sp"

Incident investigations are conducted in accordance with Compass policies and documented in Non-Conformance Notices or Incident reports, that are defined through the company ISO Problem Elimination and Corrective Action Procedures.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\tCompass encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management, risk management, and accident prevention.  Employees are routinely asked to participate in PHAs, incident investigations, management of change hazard analyses, and all other aspects of the prevention programs.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention programs and are specifically informed of any changes that occur in their process or work areas.  \n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n\tCompass has established safe work practices that ensure the safety of the employees.  Examples of these procedures include (1) hot work permits, designed to control spark or flame producing activities, (2) a permit and procedure to control confined space entry, and (3) a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.  These are some of procedures and permits ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\tCompass Chemicals uses contractors for various activities such as maintenance and construction.  All contractors are evaluated to ensure that they are well trained and are able to perform their job function in a safe manner.  A contractors safety record and performance are reviewed during the selection process.

Except for replacements-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve), all changes are subjected to a hazard analysis to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators in the process are notified of the change and made aware of possible repercussions and (4) that all training material, process safety information and operating procedures are updated.  The management of change system applies to changes to the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, operating or other related procedures, and other facility changes.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\n\n\tWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Smyrna plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are prepared for service, before the process is restarted.  A pre-startup safety review includes a field verification of new construction and serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is completed, and (4) a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed, if necessary.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nCompass trains the employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in an injury,\n and to investigate a near miss, that could have resulted in serious injury to employees, the public or the environment.

Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties of the substances used in the process and their associated hazards and (3) a detailed review of the operating procedures for that process.  Once they have demonstrated their understanding of this initial training, they are paired with an experienced operator to learn their specific job functions and tasks.  After they demonstrate their competence in performing these tasks, they are allowed to work independently. \n\n\tThrough oral reviews, written tests and on-the-job demonstration, Compass ensures that the employees understand the training provided for them.   All training administer to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\tCompass maintains the mechanical integrity of the equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  the inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and identify a root cause(s) for the deficiency, so that future problems may be avoided.

A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, environmental and maintenance experience systematically examines each hazard in each section of the process and identifies potential causes and a range of possible consequences.  The team then compares the hazard to the existing set of prevention and mitigation measures designed to contain that hazard, making further recommendations when deemed necessary.  These recommendations are listed as action items and are resolved and prioritized by management and the items are tracked until they are implemented.  Compass updates and re-validates each PHA every five years or whenever a significant change is made.  The results and findings from these re-validation studies are documented and retained and recommendations are tracked as action items by management until resolved or completed.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\tCompass engineers, operators and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial start-up of a new or improved processes.  Operating procedures are used for each process and are also used as a reference by experienced employees, to provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about the safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations and applicable safety and health information.
