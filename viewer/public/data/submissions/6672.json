(DPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies.   Safety is an essential part of our operations, the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPC is a 52-year-old company whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products. For example, chlorine is used to produce sodium hypochlorite commonly know as household bleach.   We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate more than 20 plants across the United States.\n \nWe have these regulated substances at our facility: Ammonia (anhydrous), Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  DPC transfers and/or stores these materials in 150-lb. cylinders, 800-lb. containers, and ton containers for use by our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventories of these substances at this facility are:\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - 53,750 lbs.\nChlorine - 1,200,000 lbs.\nSulfur dioxide"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Sulfur Dioxide repackaging.  The scenario involves releasing the entire contents of a railcar in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0078 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine is the failure of a 1/2\" hose on the filling station in the repackaging process.  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  It is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems. This release would reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm) and public receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is the failure of a 1/2\" hose on the filling station in the repackaging process. .  This would release material in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  It is assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include emergency shutdown systems.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDPC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every 5 years as required or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, DPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at DPC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at DPC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nDPC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.

Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History\nDPC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, the number of accidental releases has been reduced to a minimum.\n\nThere has been 1 accidental release of a regulated chemical from our facility within the last 5 years.  It took place on 09/12/1995 and involved 30 lbs. of Chlorine.  The incident was a result of human error.   Offsite, there were no impacts, deaths, or injuries.
