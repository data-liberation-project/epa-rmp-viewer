A public receptor was identified as being within the toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario.  \n\nAccording to analyses the worst case toxic endpoint of 0.042 mg/L distance is 2.5 miles from the center of a 10 minute release of inventory of 11,430 pounds of H2S contained within the Inlet Receiver.\n\nThe toxic release inventory used for the analysis was the maximum quantity of H2S that could be present within the Inlet Receiver based upon a projection of potential future inventory compositions and amounts resulting from well production forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS - FLAMMABLE AND TOXICS\nCandidates for more likely alternative release scenarios were identified and assessed to determine the furthest offsite effect that could affect a public receptor. A limited number of public receptors were identified to be within the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario [no public or environmental receptors were identified within flammable endpoints, ie; (1 psi overpressure, 5 kw/m2 for 40 seconds and Lower Flammability Limit per NFPA].  The Tioga Gas Plant Complex is coordinating emergency response plans with the Williams Country Emergency Services and 9-1-1 Director.\n\nOTHER\nWithin the past five years, Tioga Gas Plant Complex has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the executive summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not en"

The plant has several regulated flammables, such as Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Natural Gas Condensate.  The High Pressure Inlet Receiving and Condensate process could contain H2S above the threshold quantity.  It is this process only that is being submitted as a Level 3 process for both toxics and flammables.  In addition, other processes within the plant produce and contain as by-products, Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nProcesses at the Tioga Gas Plant Complex that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 1910.119. The Tioga Gas Plant Complex adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Gas Plant Complex has had no accidental release that caused offsite\nimpacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). Within the past 5 years the\nplant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables or toxics that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, public evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possib"

The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. The emergency response program includes elements required to be within the facility response plan for the alternative release scenario. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex identified potential candidates for worst case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST professional version 5.01 dispersion program and the Baker- Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodology for determining the RMP designated 1 psi overpressure contour.\n\nAccording to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 820 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Butane storage bullet when filled to the greatest amount allowed (274,429 pounds). This worst-case release would not affect any public or environmental receptor beyond property owned and occupied by Tioga Gas Plant.\n\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex identified potential candidates for toxic (H2S) worst case release scenarios.\nThese potential candidates were analyzed using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST version 6.53.1 dispersion program to identify areas that were within the toxic endpoint of 0.042 mg/L.

These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, incident investigations, compliance audits and a review of the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity programs."
