The plant has several regulated flammables, such as Methane, Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Natural Gas Condensate.  The High Pressure Inlet Receiving and Condensate process could contain H2S above the threshold quantity.  It is this process only that is being submitted as a Level 3 process for both toxics and flammables.  In addition, other processes within the plant produce and contain as by-products, Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nProcesses at the Tioga Gas Plant Complex that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 1910.119. The Tioga Gas Plant Complex adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Gas Plant Complex has had no accidental release that caused offsite\nimpacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). Within the past 5 years the\nplant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables or toxics that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, public evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. The emergency response program includes elements required to be within the facility response plan for the alternative release scenario. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe Tioga Gas Plant Complex identified potential candidates for worst case scenarios and utilized the services of the Baker Engineering and Risk Consultants, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST professional version 5.01 dispersion program and the Baker- Strehlow-Tang (BST) methodology for determining the RMP designated 1 psi overpressure contour.\n\nAccording to the analyses, the greatest maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 820 feet from the center of the explosion, resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Butane storage bullet when filled to the greatest amount allowed (274,429 pounds).
