      "SummaryText": "Inergy, L.P. acquired the North Coles Levee Fractionator on October 1, 2003. Control of this facility is now under Inergy, L.P. The facility operations are regulated by Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM), Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program (Cal ARP) and 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 Risk Management Program (RMP).  This is an RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator (NCLF) operates 24-hours a day receiving natural gas liquids (\"NGL's\") from surrounding production fields and truck deliveries.  The facility processes, stores and transfers natural gas, natural gasoline, propane and butane.  NGL's are recovered from this natural gas through a refrigeration process.  Afterwards, the remaining natural gas is sold a utility company for home use.  Finally, the NGL's are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses.  This facility has the ability to remove hazardous hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming NCLF deliveries.  In the summer, the faciility receives and stores truck deliveries of liquid propane in a fuel refrigerated propane tank.  This commodity is used as winter fuel by home owners.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735, which includes the following: Offsite Consequence Analysis, Employee Participation, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Management of Change (MOC), Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response and Compliance Audits.

      "SummaryText": "icipation includes issuing Hot Work permits, reviewing and participating in hazard reviews and MOCs, conducting contractor orientations, and annually reviewing operating procedures.\n\nThe NCLF has recently been modernized through the addition of computer controls, additional storage, six bay loading/unloading racks and completion of all 1999 Process Hazard Analysis recommendations. In addition, all loading piping and transfer control devices were replaced. The facility design standards for the modernization included the 1997 Uniform Building Code, ANSI B31.3-1996 Process Piping, NFPA 58 Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code-2001, API 2510 Design and Construction of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Installations -1995, API 2610A Fire-Protection Considerations for the design and Operation of Liquefied Petroleum Gasoline Storage Facilities, and Gas Processors Association. Fire protection upgrades are compliant with the California Fire Code - 1997 and the Kern County Fire Department. The fire protection system is new and includes pumps, fire monitors, fire hydrants, loading rack deluge, gas detectors, and fire detection systems interlocked to shutdown the process and activate the deluge. \n\nIn addition, the process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shut off valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment and, excess flow devices. The loading rack operator and truck driver are in attendance during transfer operations.\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nIn May 1999, an external event analysis consisting of a preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted. This walkthrough was comprised of a visual inspection of the above grade process piping and vessels. The reference used for the 1999 walkthrough were the following:\n\n?

Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials.\n\nThe seismic walkthrough determined that, based on the document \"Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada\", and the Uniform Building Code - 1997, this facility resides outside the boundaries and contours of a Near-Source Fault Zone.  The recommendations from this analysis were incorporated in the 2001 facility upgrade and subsequent modifications.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policy have been established by Inergy management and implemented by the employees.  In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nInergy, L.P. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies. NCLF has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five-year accident history, which is based on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and Title 19 CCR 2735.4, shows that this facility has not had a reportable accidental release.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety have been established based upon the Risk Management Plan/Process Safety Management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analyses.  Training includes employee responsibilities in the RMP/PSM programs, new employee orientation, emergency response, hot work permit procedures, and operating procedures. Additionally, planned changes to improve seismic safety of the facility were incorporated into the Process Hazard Analysis. The planned changes and PHA "

This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements established at the facility since 1993.  Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as modernization of transfer operations, piping upgrades, training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installation is an investment in good business practices.  Inergy's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases and reduce the risk to employees and the public.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nI"
