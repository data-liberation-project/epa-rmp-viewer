The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Pendleton are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Pendleton Fire\nDepartment, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of\nbulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrients.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in our 30,000 gallon\nstorage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport\ndelivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be\n140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity\nas limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200\nppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in a 3 transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is\nassumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the\nflow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,638 pounds. The distance to the\nendpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The\nAme"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\nnor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
