This is demonstrated through our prevention program which covers areas such as operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated substances.  Valero Renewable Fuels, LLC carries a written emergency response plan to assist with accidental releases of hazardous materials. This plan includes all aspects of emergency response including evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident procedures.\n\n\n\nProcesses and Regulated Substances \n\nValero Renewable Fuels, LLC operates an ethanol fuel production plant located Aurora, South Dakota. The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and processes by-products known as dry and wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which contains a flammable mixture.The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 1,200,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control. The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be\n\n90,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nOur facility has taken necessary steps to meet EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 as well as Process Safety Management requirement under OSHA. Written procedures are in place at Valero Renewables to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process Operators, Maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are notified and trained to ens"
