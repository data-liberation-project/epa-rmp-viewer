      "SummaryText": "Kinder Morgan Southeast Terminals, LLC (KMST) - Selma Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including the associated piping and one 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel.  KMST owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco Partners Butane Blending, LLC (Sunoco) owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System.  Sunoco and KMST each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System.   Sunoco controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMST oversees the unloading of butane trucks into the storage vessel and conducts routine visual inspections.\n\n\n\nSunoco constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA Code) No. 58 (2011 Edition) for Liquefied Petroleum Gas Storage.  Sunoco designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System, in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Selma Fire Department as well as Johnston County Emergency Management.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and the Johnston Medical Center, which is the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\n\n\n\nThe Selma Butane Blending System's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessel which equates to 246,697 pounds of butane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The system's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Parties c"

This facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is the Parties' policy to initially contact the owner of the equipment - Sunoco and the local fire department.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department.  The Selma Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\n\n\n\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point pneumatic valve feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Additional vessel protection includes an intumescent coating.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \n\n\n\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Selma Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion.\n\n"
