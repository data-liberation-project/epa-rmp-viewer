The primary function of the refinery is to convert various crude oils into marketable products, including various grades of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, propane and asphalt.  This facility has a rated processing capacity of 31,000 barrels a day of crude oil. Holly Corporation purchased the refinery from Phillips Petroleum Company on June 1, 2003.  Over the past 50 years, extensive additions and improvements to the refinery have been made, including numerous safety and environmentally related processes.\n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThere are several RMP regulated chemicals at the refinery produced as either process intermediates or finished products.  RMP regulated flammable substances are generally mixtures of gases/gas liquids such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane and pentane.  The only two regulated toxic chemical onsite above the RQ is Hydrofluoric (HF) Acid and Aqua Ammonia.  While regulated  flammable mixtures can be found in most refining processes, HF Acid is only present in alkylation unit and Aqua Ammonia is present in unit 22 and unit 68 . \n\n  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at the  Woods Cross Refinery.  Since this facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (promulgated in 1992), these program elements have been in place for many years, which essentia"

Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process.  This process information provides a foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures and determining applicability, in some cases, for the need for management of change.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA process hazards analysis is a systematic and methodical study to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  A PHA provides information to Refinery management and employees in making decisions for improving the safety and reducing the consequences of undesirable and/or unplanned releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study Technique) methodology was used for performing all PHA's at the Woods Cross Refinery. Each unit process is divided into small sections, referred to as \"nodes\".  Each node is studied using a series of guide words representing deviations from normal operations (e.g., no flow, reverse flow, more flow, less flow).  The causes for each deviation are recorded and considered for potential effects.  Existing safeguards are noted, then suggestions to prevent the deviation, or mitigate its effects, are recorded for all findings that result in significant hazards.  The findings from the HAZOP, which are reviewed by refinery management for final  acceptance and assignment, are further divided into one of the following two categories:\n\n\n\n- Recommendations are items that the PHA team believes have catastrophic implications.\n\n"

Copies of the Operating Procedures manuals are available to employees at all control rooms, as well as various office locations.   Written procedures address various operating modes, such as 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, and 6) consequences of deviation.  Operating Procedures manuals have been developed for all operating units at the Woods Cross Refinery and are periodically reviewed and updated; they complement the existing \"Operating Manuals\", which are more detailed in nature.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Woods Cross Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Training modules developed for each operating unit primarily cover operating procedures, which include such topics as startup/shutdown, emergency procedures, safety precautions, etc.  Written and practical tests are give to all participants after the training modules have been completed.  Refresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible. Training in safe work practices is given to all employees during new employee safety orientation,  annual safety training sessions, special classes and monthly safety meetings.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that promotes the long-term reliability of the  Refinery processes and related equipment.

All critical equipment (listed under the six general types above) are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule.  Deficiencies are corrected under the plant work order system.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n\n\nManagement of Change procedures require that proposed changes are reviewed before they are implemented to ensure that all safety-related concerns and issues are considered and appropriate action is taken prior to implementing the change.  MOC procedures apply to any temporary or permanent change (except for \"replacement in kind\") to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures that affect a covered process; this also includes changes to the general plant or facility that affect a covered process or impact offsite (i.e., \"public\") receptors.\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are performed to ensure that the appropriate process safety information requirements have been met, any new or modified equipment has been installed according to design specifications, appropriate safety and operating procedures are in place and applicable training has been given prior to start-up of new or modified facilities.  A PSSR is generally conducted for all installations or modifications that require an MOC.  \n\n\n\nCompliance audits\n\n\n\nAudits serve as a self-evaluation tool to measure compliance with the PSM standard and the effectiveness of the Company's implementation program.

The program, which is included in its Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) manual, consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including chemical releases, fires and explosions.  There are four emergency response teams maintained at the refinery, which consist of volunteer employees: 1) Fire Brigade, 2) Hazmat Team, 3) Technical Rescue Team, and 4) Emergency First Responders (medical first aid).  All team members receive initial and periodic refresher training.  The Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage all emergency response situations.  The refinery is staffed by a shift superintendent on a 24 hours/day basis, who is the acting Incident Commander until relieved by one of the primary Incident Commanders.  Emergency communication systems are maintained to notify refinery team members and the local emergency dispatcher, as well as coordinate response efforts.  Communication systems include audible plant alarms, two-way radios, pagers and celluar phones.\n\n \n\nThe Company is a member of the Salt Lake Refiners Mutual Aid organization, which allows each company to borrow resources, such as fire fighting apparatus and foam, during an emergency.  The refinery emergency response teams periodically conduct drills and training exercises with members of the Mutual Aid organization as well as local Fire Departments.\n\n\n\nThe Company sponsors a CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) Committee, which is comprised of local city officials and fire, police and sheriff representatives.
