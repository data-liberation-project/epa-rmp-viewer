The anhydrous ammonia is used as raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer. The Three Mile Fertilizer Plant has been recognized as a \u00c2\u00bfPredictive Filling\u00c2\u00bf site.\n \nThe properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in its handling. It is the policy of Monte Vista to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community. Safety depends upon the competent training of Cooperative personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled:\nThe Three Mile facility does not have a stationary storage.   The only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is being reported under \u00c2\u00bfPredictive Filling\u00c2\u00bf stored in 3 rail cars with a maximum of 453,000 pounds.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations. The facility design and construction is in accordance with the ANSI K 61.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards. It is formally inspected a minimum of once a year for compliance to all applicable standards by an out-of-house person. Corrective and routine maintenance is performed at the facility to maintain compliance with the appropriate standards. Employees at the cooperative receive training to meet Federal and state requirements to handle hazardous materials along with additional training using industry training programs and schools.\n\nFive-year accident history:\nThis site has not experienced a reportable accidental release of anhydrous"

However, employees are familiar with the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, and the local fire department is familiar with the plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nMonte Vista has developed and are keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining\nto the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process. All employees are trained in the area where they will perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the plant is allowed. The PSI will enable the employees and contractors of Monte Vista to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \nMonte Vista is committed to performing PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with Monte Vista's processes. The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify the mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mitigation systems, and emergency systems will function properly to eliminate or reduce the consequences of a mishap.  The PHA will be revalidated at least every five years to assure that the PHA is consistent with the current process.\n\nOperating Procedures (OPs)\nMonte Vista has developed OPs to assure safe work practices are maintained. The OPs address:\n-all operating modes (startup, shutdown, etc.)\n-operating limits, consequences of deviations, safeguards\n-health and safety\n-safety systems and functions\nThe OPs are reviewed and maintained to be current and accurate.\n\nTraining\nMonte Vista is committed to provide its employee's comprehensive training to assure that the work force can\nperform their duties safely"

Employees assigned to a process area are trained in all\nsteps of operating phases including startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency operations, operating limits, and safety systems and functions. Employees are provided refresher training at least every three years, and annual review of operating procedures.\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nMonte Vista has developed a written program of maintaining the MI of process equipment at the Three Mile facility. The MI program includes inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nIncident Investigation\nMonte Vista has communicated to all of its employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses. After an incident is reported, an incident investigation is conducted. Findings and recommendations are promptly addressed and resolutions documented.\n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit of the Monte Vista facility will be conducted at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of Monte Vista's process with the release prevention program (RPP). The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise. Recommendations resulting from the audit are addressed and deficiencies documented and corrected.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nMonte Vista's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at Monte Vista will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications. Monte Vista's MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place.\n-authorization requirement for the change.\n-technical basis for the proposed change.\n-impact of the change on health and safety.\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training wi"

In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC,\nMonte Vista will conduct a PSR. The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR. All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\nContractors\nMonte Vista has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. It is Monte Vista's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safe work practices related to contractors and\nperiodically evaluate contractors.  Monte Vista will inform contractors of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process. Monte Vista will also explain to the contractors the applicable provisions of Monte Vista's emergency response plan.\n\nEmployee Participation\nMonte Vista is committed to involving employees in the conduct and development of a PHA and on the development of the other elements of plant safety, process safety management, and risk management planning. Monte Vista encourages employees to read, review and provide comments on all PSM/RMP documents.\n\nHot Work Permits\nHot work is defined as work that could generate a flame, intense heat, or sparks as a result of electric or gas welding, cutting, blazing, abrasions or similar operations. A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near Monte Vista's process.
