      "SummaryText": "1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  The Kraft Foods NA-Garland, TX \n\nfacility has an excellent record of release prevention for its anhydrous ammonia \n\nrefrigeration process (AARP).  The facility has a thorough emergency training program for \n\non-site emergency responders and a complete preventative maintenance program as part of a \n\nComputerized Maintenance Management System.  The emergency response policies at the facility \n\nensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  There \n\nare also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the Garland \n\nFire Department, in the event of an emergency.  \n\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances:  Kraft manufactures salad dressings, \n\nbarbecue sauces, and ready-to-drink beverages at the facility.  The facility NCICS code is \n\n311941, Mayonnaise, Dressing, and other Prepared Sauce manufacturing.  The facility \n\nproduces and packages dressings, barbecue sauces, and ready-to-drink beverages for consumer \n\nconsumption.  The storage and process areas of the facility are, therefore, refrigerated to \n\npreserve the products.  Kraft has one 40 CFR 68 (RMP Rule) regulated substance at the \n\nfacility - anhydrous ammonia (ammonia).  Ammonia is used at the facility to refrigerate raw \n\nmaterials and finished food products and to provide climate control.  The threshold quantity \n\nfor regulation of ammonia under 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The facility stores and uses \n\n38,000 pounds of ammonia and is, therefore, subject to the requirements of the RMP Rule.  \n3.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nAmmonia falls under Program 3 of the RMP Rule, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety \n\nmanagement (PSM) program.  Kraft has developed a compliant PSM program for the ammonia \n\nsystem at the facility, and is, therefore, also in compliance with the Program 3 \n\nrequirements.  There are several ke"

      "SummaryText": "y aspects of the PSM program:  (1) Utility personnel are \n\npresent on site and assigned to the ammonia system 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, (2) \n\nThe facility maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating \n\nprocedures, (3) The facility has an aggressive PSM meeting schedule, and (4) Changes to the \n\nammonia system are controlled under the Change Management Process.  \n\n4.0 Five-year Accident History:  There have been no reportable accidental releases of \n\nammonia, as defined by 40 CFR 68.42(a), at the facility in the last ten years.  \n\n5.0 Emergency Response Program: Kraft has instituted an Emergency Response Plan for the \n\nfacility that divides employees into various management and response teams.  There are 25 \n\nin-plant contacts for emergency response which are listed in the Plan.  There are also \n\nback-up personnel available in the event that the primary incident response personnel are \n\nnot available.  At the discretion of the Incident Commander, the Garland Fire Department \n\n(GFD) will be called to provide additional emergency responders and equipment.  For all fire \n\nemergencies, GFD will be summoned.  In addition, an ambulance always responds with GFD by \n\ncity policy.  The plan includes information about the frequency and content of employee \n\nemergency response training.  Most importantly, the plan contains specific procedures to be \n\nfollowed in the event of a fire or other ammonia emergency.  These include:  (1) response to \n\nan accidental discharge of hazardous materials or waste (2) notification of internal, \n\nexternal, and regulatory agencies, (3) accident prevention measures, (4) procedures to \n\ncontain and limit the duration of an emergency, (5) countermeasures to be employed during an \n\nemergency, (6) procedures to protect emergency responders and other employees.  The plan \n\nalso incorporates the facility Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan by \n\nreference.  The SPCC plan includes the locatio"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  As a result of periodic reviews of the ammonia \n\nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) required by the RMP Rule and the PSM program, a number of \n\nprocess improvements have been implemented in the last 10 years.  The most recent example is \n\nthe addition of an automatic ammonia sensing and shut-off system for the boiler room to be \n\ncompleted in the second quarter of 2004."
