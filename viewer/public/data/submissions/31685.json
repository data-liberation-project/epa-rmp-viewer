Safety meetings are held every three months, with all water treament plant personell in attendance.  Chlorine safety and Moristown Utilities safety procedures are discussed in depth.\n\nThe Roy S. Oakes Water Treatment Plant uses conventional treatment methods for treating water for human consumption.  Chlorine gas is used to make a chlorine solution that is added to the water to disinfect the water by disrupting the cell walls of the pathogens in the water.\n\nThe Roy S. Oaks Water Treatment Plant has chlorine as the only hazardous chemical  that require the implementation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Morristown Utilities has in place a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan for chlorine that coincides to work with the RMP to provide safe use of the chlorine gas. \n\nThe chlorination process system utilizes a vacuum feed control system.  The vacuum feed system provides that the vacuum regulator mounted on the cylinder will shut down the flow of chlorine gas in the event of a broken feed line.  Only two cylinders are hooked up on-line during normal operation. A switch-over device allows that only one cylinder is feeding at a tme with the other cylinder on standby.  This vacuum system provides for the safest available feed system.\n\nCoordination and communication with the emergency response in the Morristown area is constantly updated.  The Haz-Mat team from the local fire department train periodically at our facility for familarity with the process, equipment, and facility.\n\nMorristown Roy S. Oakes Water Treatment Plant is a fifteen million gallon per day plant.  The maximum amount that will be on hand at any given time is 10 one ton cylinders.  During normal operations, the average containers on hand are five full cylinders.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years at the Roy S. Oakes Water Treatment Plant.\n\nIn t"
