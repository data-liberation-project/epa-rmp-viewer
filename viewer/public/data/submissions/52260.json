      "SummaryText": "CF Industries, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, Inc., is a major producer and distributor of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products. CF Industries operates world-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada; conducts phosphate mining and manufacturing operations in Central Florida; and distributes fertilizer products through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States\n\n\nWhat are fertilizers?\n\nFertilizers are plant nutrients.  Nutrients exist naturally in the earth's soil and atmosphere, and in animal manure.  However, naturally occurring nutrients are not always available in the forms that plants can use.  Therefore, man-made fertilizer is vital to food production.  Man-made and natural fertilizers contain the same ingredients, but man-made fertilizers act more quickly and are less susceptible to weather changes.  Farmers, ranchers, and gardeners add these fertilizers directly to the soil, where they can be absorbed by plants for healthy growth.  Incorporated into a program of best management practices, which includes soil testing, man-made fertilizer use leads to higher crop yields and greater environmental protection.  Man-made fertilizers have made a tremendous difference in farm productivity and the well being of the world's people.\n\n\nCF Industries Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex\n\nCF Industries' nitrogen fertilizer complex at Donaldsonville, LA is North America?s largest and, in many respects, most flexible nitrogen operation. The complex covers over 200 acres, and it can produce and ship approximately 4.5 million tons of fertilizer each year.  Highly skilled employees keep the plant running 24 hours a day.  Operating units are shut down periodically to undergo rigorous inspection and maintenance. \n\nThe Donaldsonville facility is unique in its ability to produce world-scale quantities of three major nitrogen fertilizers -- ammonia, "

Product storage facilities, rail car loading stations, ammonia pipeline injection stations, and barge and ship loading docks fronting the Mississippi River ensure a steady supply of nitrogen fertilizers for the farm market.\n\n\nDescription of Manufacturing Units\n\nManufacturing activity at Donaldsonville begins with the production of ammonia.  Ammonia is in turn utilized in the production of urea, nitric acid, and UAN solution.  The complex has four ammonia plants, one urea solution plant, three granular urea plants, three nitric acid plants, and two UAN blending units.\n\nThe primary RMP regulated substance at the facility is ammonia that is manufactured, shipped as a product, and used as feedstock for other products.  Chlorine is also present in excess of threshold quantities.  Chlorine is used as a biocide in water treatment.  The flammable substances hydrogen and methane also qualify for regulation under the rule.  Hydrogen is produced from natural gas and water in the ammonia process and trace quantities present in by-product carbon dioxide are a concern in the urea process.  Natural gas, which contains 95% methane, is used as feedstock for the ammonia process and as a fuel throughout the facility.\n\n\nEnvironment, Health & Safety Philosophy\n\nIt is the philosophy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a manner designed to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees.\n\nCF Industries is committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations and will promote environmental awareness and education among its employees and with the communities in which it operates.  CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees and will take all practical steps to eliminate the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job.  CF Industries will continue to encourage off-the-job employee sa"

The Corporation does not hesitate to go beyond legal requirements if, in its prudent judgment, a higher level of performance is in order.\n\nManagement at each facility is directly responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy.  The programs and procedures are continually reviewed and updated, and each facility is periodically audited to assure compliance. \n\nThe people of CF Industries are dedicated to, and trained in, the safe operation of the Company's production, storage, and distribution facilities.  However, CF Industries' personnel are also trained in key aspects of emergency response. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards 29 CFR 1910.119.  According to EPA, PSM standards form the basis for the Agency's RMP prevention program component\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility's emergency response plan meets the OSHA requirements of 29CFR1910.120 (q).  The Incident Command System method of establishing an appropriate organization for response to emergency situations is the basis of the plan.  Incident Commanders, Medical First Responders, Hazardous Materials Technicians, Firefighters, Rescue Team Members, Building Wardens, and other support personnel are trained and available.  Facility personnel participate in Community Awareness Emergency Response Committee meetings where representatives of 15 chemical companies and the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness formulate, implement, and maintain up-to-date community emergency response plans.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThree incidents have occurred at the facility within the last five years that meet RMP rule requirements for reporting. Two of the incidents involved releases of flammables that caused on-site prope"

The fire converted the hydrogen into water vapor, which resulted in no release to the environment. The third involved over pressurization and rupture of process piping that also caused on-site property damage. No offsite impact occurred.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility has a goal of continuous improvement and uses total quality management techniques to define and address issues.  Continued pursuit of the improvement goal is planned to improve safety."
