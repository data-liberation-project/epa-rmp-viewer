              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company routinely invites  local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

The storage and handling system consists of a\n\nstorage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted\n\nto authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is\n\nsecurity-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA\n\nregulations.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state\n\ncodes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\n\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National\n\nStandards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous\n\nAmmonia\".
