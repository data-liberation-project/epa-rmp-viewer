KNC's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant is one of several facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the facility, anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) are produced and loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.     \n\nThe ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Dodge City Nitrogen Plant in amounts above threshold quantity.  An RMP-regulated flammable mixture containing hydrogen and methane is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity"

The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\nOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \nOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Dodge City Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\nMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\nMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\nMinimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency shutdown buttons at the loading areas.\nReducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\nReducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms on storage tanks and bullets.\nR"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be, the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Western Plains Medical Complex and Victory Electric.  The Dodge City Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
