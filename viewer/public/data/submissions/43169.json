As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a trailer failure and 28,000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the hydrogen sulfide cloud will travel approximately 9.3 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint  concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe hydrogen sulfide alternative case scenario involves a pressure relief valve.  In this scenario , approximately 4,220 pounds of hydrogen sulfide gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the hydrogen sulfide cloud will travel approximately 1.6 miles before the endpoint concentration is met.      \n\nBoron Trichloride\nLiquid boron trichloride is stored at the KMCLLC facility in cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a storage vessel failure and 5250 pounds of boron trichloride, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.

When approved changes require updates to our process safety information and/or operating procedures, we revise these documents and train employees on these changes before operations resume.\n \nIn accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, we perform a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified covered process before it is placed in service.  We perform pre-startup reviews on new or modified processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Our pre-startup review confirms that:\n\n\u00bf Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\u00bf Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate \n\u00bf PHAs have been performed on new covered processes and all recommendations have been resolved\n\u00bf MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified covered processes\n\u00bf Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\n\nWe use a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist as an aid in documenting the performance of our pre-startup reviews. Our checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to startup.  The person responsible for the project or maintenance task prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and provides the reviewer names responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup review safety questions.  Each reviewer signs off on the checklist when satisfied that assigned safety questions are complete and no problems exist.  All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist before startup can be authorized.\n\nIn"

      "SummaryText": "accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, we audit our RMP-covered processes to be certain that our prevention programs are effective.  Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited.  The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\n\n\u00bf Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\n\u00bf Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n\u00bf Capability to document audit results\n\u00bf Knowledge of the process to be audited\n\nOur audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit.  They use a protocol that contains questions that systematically address each RMP rule requirement.  The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover.  Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and weaknesses are identified.  At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n\nWe have a plant management committee that promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for corrective action implementation, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored until open issue"

We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur. If the incident meets RMP-classification criteria, we initiate an investigation within 48 hours.  We assemble an investigation team consisting of:\n\n\u00bf At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n\u00bf A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees\n\u00bf Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event\n\nWe train our investigation team leaders in investigation techniques.

We accomplish this review by routing a copy of the approved report to potentially affected employees (and contract employees) and by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations. We periodically update this document as changes occur.  We consult with the employees and their representatives on ways to improve participation in the RMP.  Periodically, in our safety meetings, we review results of PHAs and resolutions of their recommendations.\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, we use our hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n\nWe studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure that addresses these requirements.  We also created a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed.  We train all employees who may use or enforce a hot work permit activity. New employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure as part of the safe work practices orientation.

We have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process. \n\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the bid process.  The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.  We provide a safety orientation to familiarize contractors with the type of operations and associated hazards in the areas in which they will be working, which includes (1) the plant's hazardous chemicals, including toxic, fire/explosion, physical, and chemical properties, (2) safe work practices in use at our facility, and (3) actions they must take in the event of a plant emergency.  We provide copies of our Contractor Safety Manual, which contains plant safety rules/policies, safe work practices, a material hazards summary, and an outline of emergency actions for contractors.
