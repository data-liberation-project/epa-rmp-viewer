The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority facility receives State Project water from the eastern branch of the California Aqueduct via the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD).  The plant processes include flow measurement and control, chemical mixing and flow distribution, flocculation and sedimentation, filtration, effluent distribution, and solids handling and waste wash-water processes.  Chlorine is used in several of these processes for disinfection, taste and odor control, algae control, and color control.\n\nThe existing chlorine system consists of four main subsystems: (1) Storage and Supply, which includes the one ton container storage and feed piping; (2) Feed, which includes pressure reducing valves and chlorinators and their associated piping; (3) Distribution and Injection, which includes the chlorine vacuum piping, injectors, and solution lines; and (4) Control, which includes flow pacing and residual chlorine feedback control.  \n\nLiquid chlorine is delivered to the plant in one ton containers, typically with a maximum of 16 containers (32,000 pounds) kept in the storage area.  Chlorine is withdrawn as gas from the one ton containers and passed through a vacuum regulator to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators regulate the gas flow and discharge it to the injection "

This concentrated solution is then injected at several points throughout the plant: the flash mix vault, the sedimentation basin effluent channels, the filter effluent channel, the filter effluent vault and the plant effluent vault.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the Cal-OSHA 5189 regulation to ensure safe handling and management of the chlorine treatment process.  Chlorine detection systems are in place to enable a quick response to any chlorine releases.  Employee emergency training is an ongoing process at the facility, with drills conducted frequently to ensure familiarity with the response procedures.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment, there have been no reported releases of chlorine at this facility over the last five years (May 1999 through May 2004).\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n    1.)    To save lives.\n    2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n    3.)    To protect the environment.\n    4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Water Facilities Authority maintains a safety committee whose members include the emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the Water Facilities Authority responsible person, Mr. Bernie Bautista at least once a year.

In the case of a chemical-related (chlorine) emergency, its is the policy of Water Facilities Authority to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Water Facilities Authority.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the 1999 Initial PHA, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the initial study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the review of chlorine checklists, and a site inspection to review seismic issues. \n\nIn addition the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the Water Facilities Authority employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining Process Safety Management and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
