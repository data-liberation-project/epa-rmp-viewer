We believe it is a comprehensive plan, developed and continually improved over more than 56 years of operation.  However, it is recognized that there may exist a remote possibility that an unforeseen emergency event could occur.  Accordingly, our RMP describes what could theoretically happen in such an event.   This summary is organized as follows:\n\nIntroduction; \nArkema Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety;\nFacility Identification and regulated substances in covered processes;\nPrevention Program; \nFive-Year Accident History; \nEmergency Response Plan; and\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nArkema Inc. Policies for Health, Environment, and Safety\n\nRisk management and safety have been important concerns at Arkema for many years;  this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  We are committed to conducting our operations in a safe, responsible manner and to reducing risks to health and the environment.  \n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety starts with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).  Senior management routinely dedicate time to a review of HES matters, including safety.  This emphasis on safety is carried through to the facility level, where the Plant Manager and the Safety Committee regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement.  The success of Arkema's HES programs is also reflected by a strong commitment to safety by employees and contractors. \n\nArkema Inc.'s HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials designed to fulfill its commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Management Program guidance to help our facilities prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents. \n\nOur plant keeps health and sa"

In issues related to emergency response, Arkema works with the Livingston County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to plan responses to emergencies and to assist the Plant Emergency Organization (PEO) in actual response efforts as and if needed.  These emergency plans are reviewed with the LEPC, and other local emergency responders like the fire and police departments, and hospitals.  Our plant's Community Advisory Panel (CAP) was started in early 1998 to inform the community about our plant and related activities and address questions or concerns. \n\nArkema Inc. also takes pride in our commitment to protect the environment.  We are dedicated to continuous reduction of waste, and have a comprehensive program called E-3 (Enhancing Environmental Excellence) designed to promote recycling and waste minimization. \n\nArkema is also part of Responsible Care\u00c2\u00ae, an industry-wide initiative among members of the American Chemistry Council. Through Responsible Care, our industry demonstrates its continuing commitment to health, safety, and the environment.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Geneseo facility, located on Route 63 in Piffard, New York, is proud to be a part of the Genesee Valley community.  Our company is dedicated to achieving the safe manufacture of high-quality products and the continuing protection of the environment.  The Geneseo plant produces organic peroxides that are used primarily in the production of  acrylics, elastomers, low density polyethylene (LDPE), polyesters, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  Many common plastic products such as automobile components, toys, food packaging, etc., are manufactured with the chemicals produced at the Geneseo plant. \n\nArkema uses one of the substances regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule, above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.

Since our plant stores in excess of 1,650 gallons of this material, an RMP is required to be filed with the EPA.   NPCF is used as a process ingredient to make a product used in the manufacture of some of the plastics described above. \n\n                                                                                         \nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAt Arkema we take handling of chemicals and plant safety very seriously.  We use a variety of safety equipment and written procedures to maintain the integrity of our processes, prevent releases and reduce the impact should releases occur.  In fact, this NPCF storage system is also regulated by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) as well as EPA's RMP regulations.  \n\nSpecific Accident Prevention Measures We Take in the Case of Normal-Propyl Chloroformate (NPCF):\n\nWe DESIGN for Safety:\n\n NPCF tank is in secondary containment.  If a spill occurred, the entire contents should stay in a dike.\nA new tank dike partition was constructed in late 2001 to minimize potential RMP worst case scenario off-site impact.\n Automatic high level alarms and shutoffs are installed to prevent tank overfilling.\n The tank is filled to no more than 90% capacity, as additional protection against overfilling. \n Pressure/safety devices are installed so that the tank cannot be over/under pressurized.\n Shutoff valves can be activated remotely to isolate the tank if necessary.\n During tank filling, the unloading trailer is staged in an contained area large enough to hold the entire trailer contents.\n Sewers in the vicinity of the tank can be used if necessary to convey spillage to a pre-treatment system capable of treating NPCF.\n Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted prior to startup of new or modified NPCF equipment.\n Team of trained personnel"
