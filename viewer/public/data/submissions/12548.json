              "Description": "The Prevention Program ensures that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.  The completion of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements essentially satisfies the 112(r) Prevention Program requirements for the NH3 in the refrigeration process.  Specifically, Chef Francisco has performed or developed the following for the affected process:\n\n7 Process safety information: Chef Francisco compiled written process safety information that is completed prior to conducting any process hazard analysis required by the rule.  This written information enables Chef Francisco and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving regulated substances.  Minimum information includes hazard data such as that found on a Material Safety Data Sheet, technology information, and equipment information.\n\n7 Process hazard analysis: A hazard evaluation has been performed by an experienced team to identify, assess, and control the hazards involved in each of the covered areas.  The hazardous operations (\"hazop\") and \"what-if\" methodology was used for determining and evaluating the hazards of the process.  The analysis addressed the hazards of the process, the identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences, engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, stationary source siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. These analyses are updated and revalidated on a five year basis.\n\n7 Operating procedures: Written procedures have been developed and implemented to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in the covered process consistent with the process safety information.  Elements that are addressed include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain a process.  These procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they represent current operating practice.  Annual certification helps to assure the currency and accuracy of the procedures.  In addition, safe work practices, applicable to employees and contractor employees, are developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during a variety of plant operations.\n\n7 Training:  Initial and refresher training is conducted as appropriate for each employee involved in operating the covered process.  Chef Francisco ascertains and documents that each employee has received and understood the required training.\n\n7 Mechanical integrity:  Chef Francisco has developed a comprehensive mechanical integrity program that applies to pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and compressors in the covered processes.  Written procedures, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, correction of equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are all included in Chef Francisco's mechanical integrity program.\n7 Management of change:  Written procedures have been established and implemented to manage changes (except for \"replacements in kind\") to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and changes to other stationary sources that affect the covered process.  The procedures ensure that the technical basis for the proposed change, the impact of the change on safety and health, the modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change are all addressed.  Appropriate employees and contractors are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process or affected part of the process.  Updates to the RMP are made if required by the nature of the change.\n\n7 Pre-startup review:  A pre-startup safety review is performed for any new covered processes and for significantly modified covered processes at Chef Francisco.  Such review confirms that prior to introduction of regulated substances to the process that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; for new stationary sources, a process hazard analysis has been performed and for modified stationary sources, management of change requirements have been met; and training of each employee involved in operating a covered process has been completed.\n\n7 Compliance audits:  Chef Francisco evaluates compliance with the provisions of this section at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.  Chef Francisco's compliance audit is conducted by a team consisting of outside auditors, the Security/Safety Manager and representatives from each covered process.  A report of the compliance audit findings is developed.  Chef Francisco promptly determines and documents an appropriate response to each of the audit findings, establishes a schedule for acting on the findings and documents that deficiencies have been corrected.  The two most recent audit reports are retained on file at the Chef Francisco facility.\n\n7 Incident investigation: Chef Francisco will investigate each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  This investigation shall be initiated as promptly as possible, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  An incident investigation team will be established with appropriate personnel.  A report, which shall be retained for five years, is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation.  A system has been established to promptly address and resolve the findings and recommendations of the incident report, with documentation of resolutions and corrective actions.  The report shall be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contract employees where applicable, whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.\n\n7 Employee participation:  Chef Francisco has developed a plan of action regarding employee participation.  Employees and their collective bargaining unit representatives are consulted on the conduct and development of process hazards analyses and on the development of the other elements of process safety management in the 112(r) rule.  Employees and their collective bargaining unit representatives are also provided access to process hazard analyses and to all other information required under the rule.\n\n7 Hot-work permit:  Chef Francisco issues a hot-work permit for hot-work operations conducted on or near the covered process.  The permit documents that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot-work operations.  The permit further indicates the date(s) authorized for hot work and identify the object on which the hot work is to be performed. The permit is kept on file until the hot-work operation is completed.\n\n7 Contractors:  Chef Francisco and contract-company owners and operators comply with the requirements for contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to the covered process. Contractor issues include, among other responsibilities, evaluation of past contractor safety performance and programs, and informing contractors of known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractor's work and the affected processes. (Note that this part of the RMP requirements does not apply to contractors providing incidental services that do not influence process safety, such as janitorial work, food and drink services, laundry, delivery or other supply services.)\n\nIn addition to what is required by the 112(r) rule, Chef Francisco is prepared to prevent and mitigate accidental releases by safe process and equipment design, maintenance of equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations.\n7 Process and Equipment Design:  Backup safety systems, pressure relief valves, insulated vessels and piping, and local emergency shut down systems are used to help mitigate the potential for leaks from the affected process and equipment.\n\n7 Equipment Maintenance:  Chef Francisco has a preventive maintenance program in place along with work planning, safety checks and reviews, periodic inspections, and qualified maintenance personnel.\n\n7 Safe Operations: Operators of the covered processes are trained and certified.  Written procedures are in place and followed by operators.\n\n7 Operations Auditing:  Internal and independent audits of the NH3 operation are performed.",

Chef Francisco is a subsidiary of Heinz U.S.A.  Our workforce of approximately 250 employees is comprised of production, maintenance, plant operations, technical, clerical and management personnel.  Many of our employees have been with us for years.  We are proud of our facility, the quality of our products and the stability of our workforce.\n\nThe federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, codified in 40 CFR Part 68, were written to help prevent the accidental release of extremely hazardous substances and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  All facilities with threshold quantities (TQs) of the listed regulated acutely toxic and flammable substances are subject to these provisions.  The listed substances include 77 toxic chemicals with TQs ranging from 500 lbs. to 20,000 lbs., while the 63 flammable substances all have a TQ of 10,000 lbs.\n\nChef Francisco has one chemical that meets the toxic chemical TQ, and thus, this substance must be included in a Risk Management Program.  This chemical is anhydrous ammonia (\"NH3\").  The TQ for NH3 is 10,000 lbs. Chef Francisco stores approximately 35,000 lbs. for use as a refrigerant in the Chef Francisco plant.\nThe major Clean Air Act Section 112(r) (\"112(r)\") requirements with which Chef Francisco must comply for use of NH3 in the refrigeration process include:\n\n* Management System development and documentation;\n* Hazard Assessment for the affected process;\n* Prevention Program completion;\n* Emergency Response Program coordination; and\n* Risk Management Plan submittal.  \n\nIn addition, Chef Francisco recognizes its responsibility under Section 112(r)(1), the \"general duty clause\", to handle all extremely hazardous substances safely to prevent their accidental release and to minimize the consequences of a"
