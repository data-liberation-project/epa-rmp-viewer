      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nDuPont Sabine River Works Plant adheres to corporate policies, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n- All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable.\n- The Goal is Zero.  Zero injuries and zero incidents.\n\nCorporate policies are embodied in the numerous Safety, Health and Environmental and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  At Sabine River Works, the policies are implemented through the site Safety, Health and Environmental Manual and Process Safety Management Manual.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nDuPont Sabine River Works plant is located approximately 2 miles south of the city of Orange, in a rural setting on FM 1006.  The site is located on 1500 acres evenly divided between manufacturing processes, the employee recreation area, and bio-oxidation ponds.  The facility is secured by a chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24 hour security force.\n\nThe site manufactures Nylon Intermediates (hexamethylenediamine, and adipic acid) and Ethylene/Ethylene Copolymers.\n\nIn the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials, intermediates, or byproducts:\n\n- Anhydrous Ammonia\n- Aqueous Ammonia\n- Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN)\n- Vinyl Acetate monomer (VA)\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n- Butane\n- 1-Butene\n- 2-Butene-cis\n- 2-Butene-trans\n- Ethane\n- Ethylene\n- Propane\n- Propylene\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic chemical is failure of a vinyl acetate barge, with no mitigation assumed.  This release has an off-site impact, as determined by the use of the \"RMP*COMP\" program.  This release is unlikely due to the double-wall construction and high-integrity design of the barge and associated unloading equipment.\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable chemical is failure of a mixed butene storage tank, with no mitigation.  This release, if ignited, would have an off-site impa"

The ignition of this release is unlikely because the tank is located in a remote location versus normal ignition sources.  A tank failure is unlikely due to the high-integrity design, 100% X-raying of all welds during construction, and mechanical integrity program.\n\nALTERNATIVE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia - A pipe leak in the Anhydrous Ammonia transfer piping was assumed, with a 60-minute duration.  No mitigation was assumed.  This release has an off-site residential, recreational, and industrial impact, as determined by the use of the \"RMP*COMP\" program and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\nAqueous ammonia (20% concentration) - A pipe leak in the Aqueous Ammonia transfer piping was assumed.  Per the OCA Guidance for water solutions, a 10-minute release duration was assumed (since the bulk of the toxic will leave the water solution within that time).  This release has an off-site recreational but no impact on residential populations, as determined by the use of the \"RMP*COMP\" program and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\nHydrocyanic Acid (HCN) - A pipe leak in the HCN transfer system was assumed.  Because of the highly toxic nature of the material, a release duration of 60 minutes was assumed.  This release has an off-site  industrial impact as determined by the use of the \"RMP*COMP\" program and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\nVinyl acetate monomer (VA) - A vessel leak in the Vinyl Acetate Barge was assumed.  A release duration of 60 minutes was assumed because of the flammable nature of the chemical.  This release has an off-site recreational but no impact on residential populations as determined by the use of the \"RMP*COMP\" program and the \"Landview\" program census data.\n\nALTERNATIVE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nMixed Butenes - A pipe leak in the mixed Butenes transfer piping was assumed.  Because of the possibly remote location, a release duration of 60 minutes was assumed.  No mi"
