The facility was built in 1972 and was owned and operated by Armour-Dial / Dial until Pinnacle Foods purchased the facility in 2006. The ammonia refrigeration system was built in 1995 under the provisions of Process Safety Management (\"PSM\"). The plant submitted its Risk Management Plan (A?RMPA?) in June 1999 with the advent of the RMP.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been operated under PSM since 1995 and under RMP since 1999.\n\n\nA.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nPinnacle is committed to providing a safe workplace that is operated in an environmentally responsible manner. Pinnacle strives to protect all its valuable resources and assets - both personnel and property.  We live and have families in this community.  We want to prevent exposure to all our personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment. Pinnacle is also committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations relating to safety in the workplace and the protection of the environment.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nIt is PinnacleA?s policy that to promote overall public and associate safety by developing, implementing and maintaining all required elements of the EPAA?s RMP provisions and OSHAA?s PSM standard regarding the storage, handling, and processing of anhydrous ammonia used at this facility.  The incorporation of these programs helps to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic incidents.\n\nThis facility incorporates a comprehensive management system to oversee the continued de"

In turn, he has designated the facility Environmental Coordinator as PSM coordinator having overall authority for, and oversight of, the Facility RMP. As part of the PSM and Risk Management Program, the facility has an Emergency Response Plan and Procedures Manual which provides instructions and responsibilities required of facility personnel in case of the following plant emergencies: employee illness/injury, ammonia release, fire, and severe weather. The manual also provides procedures and responsibilities for controlled and emergency shutdowns of facility equipment. The management team is committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures at the facility.\n\n\nB.    FACILITY OVERVIEW AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility is located on 117 acres in a rural setting at the extreme southern edge but within the corporate limits of the City of Fort Madison, Iowa. The facility is approximately one mile from the Mississippi River but well above the 500 year flood.  The facility consists of one main plant building with over 450,000 square feet under roof. The primary purpose of our facility is the production of shelf stable canned foods.  We utilize anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration for space cooling of production areas and storage areas for incoming food ingredients and for chilling salt brine solution.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers anhydrous ammonia as hazardous; therefore, the properties, which make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant, also necessitate certain safety precautions.  A nationally recognized, reputable and professional ammonia delivery company is used to recharge the system when needed, which is approximately once a year. Steel piping then carries the ammonia to the refrigeration equipment.  Access to the site is restricted to company employees and authorized contractors and visitors.\n\nA"

      "SummaryText": "nhydrous ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance (toxic or flammable) above the applicable threshold that is used at our facility.  The refrigeration engine room is in a separate building from the rest of the plant. The nominal charge of ammonia is 20,000 pounds.\n\n\nC.    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo major releases of ammonia have occurred since ammonia was brought on site in April 1995. EPA specifies inclusion of all releases that resulted in:  deaths, injuries, significant property damage on site, known offsite deaths, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\nD.    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system design and construction is based upon accepted and proven engineering design practices for a safe operating refrigeration plant.  The system was designed and constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, ANSI / ASHRAE Standard 15 and the National Electrical Code.  Shut-off valves are strategically located throughout the refrigeration system to allow emergency shut-off, periodic maintenance and repair.  Pressure vessels are ASME rated to 250 psig and fitted with either a single or dual safety relief valve as required by ASME. The facility has an automatic ammonia detection, notification system, and response system for the engine room and refrigerated spaces. In addition, pressure reliefs are piped into a 20,000 gallon ammonia absorption water tank.\n\nThe facility complies with applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  Personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.\n\nThe facility has reviewed and revised the documents and procedures for compliance with OSHA's PSM and EPA's Risk Management Program for ammonia use and storage.  A management system has been established to maintain th"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Planning and Response Plan covers the ammonia refrigeration system in accordance with Process Safety and Risk Management.  Our emergency plan has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.   If a release of ammonia is detected by the ammonia detection system or by employees, the procedures within this manual will be followed including notification of hazardous materials responders (refrigeration technicians) by radio and as required, the involvement of the incident commander. The manual describes the level of personal protective equipment to be used to respond to ammonia incidents.  Facility responders have received initial and annual refresher training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs annually.\n\nThe facility has an in-house HAZMAT team that initially responds and works in conjunction with the Fort Madison Fire Department and the Lee County Local Emergency Planning Committee on emergency preparedness.  The Fort Madison Fire Departments and Lee County SheriffA?s Department will handle public notification through the 911 CodeRED system in coordination with the LEPC.  We meet periodically with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns. Pinnacle will work with these agencies as necessary to notify the public about an ammonia release. The manual also contains procedures for emergency alerting and response procedures for on-site personnel, off-site emergency contacts, and adjacent plants.  Senior management will handle media relations.\n\nWe strive to minimize off-site consequences through the implementation of emergency response program elements:  pre-emergency planning, facility evacuati"
