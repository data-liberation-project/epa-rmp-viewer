Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the Facility for cooling the building, making ice, and freezing products. This Facility complies with the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15 for the ammonia refrigeration system. It is the policy of Braum?s to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  Braum?s has in place policies, which limit the amount of ammonia at the Facility.  Additionally, Braum?s has prevention and management programs, which are implemented to increase the safe operation of both systems.  Braum?s believes that safe operations and accident prevention is the way to do business everyday.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, Braum's will follow the facility's Emergency Action Plan.  As part of the Action Plan, it is Braum?s policy to notify the City of Tuttle Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency and notify the public.  In the past five years, the Facility has not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  The maximum amount of ammonia stored is 15,550 pounds in the receiver and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment."
