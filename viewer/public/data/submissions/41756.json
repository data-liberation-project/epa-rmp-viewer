      "SummaryText": "The Hillsborough County Water Department  (HCWD) has an accidental release prevention policy integrating technology, established procedures and management practices into a unified approach to risk management.  The HCWD operates and manages a number of water and wastewater treatment facilities throughout unincorporated Hillsborough County, Florida.  All applicable procedures of the United States Department of Environmental Protection, Florida Department of Community Affairs and Department of Environmental Protection are adhered to.  The HCWD emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans for each facility. Each facility is in compliance with the EPA emergency response program requirements.\n\nThe Valrico Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWT) is located on 36 acres in the north portion of an 1,535-acre former phosphate mine in rural eastern Hillsborough County.  In addition to the treatment plant, the complex includes wastewater transmission facilities, a reclaimed water system, a 263 acre on site effulent sprayfield and surface water discharge facilites.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative scenerio.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the owner or operator shall assume that the ?.maximum quantity  in the largest vessel? is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is identified as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  \n\nThe HCWD used  EPA lookup tables to determine endpoints for it worst case scenario and more likely scenario.\n\nThe worst case scenario at Valrico AWT involves an unspecified failure of an one ton container of chlorine which is stored as a liquid under pressure.  This scenario was researched in the EPA lookup tables.   The EPA set the conditions for the worst case scenario modeling and assume the release of the e"

EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of offsite consequence analysis.  The HCWD believes the EPA assumptions to be  unrealistic.\n\nA.  Only a fraction of the compressed liquified chlorine will flash to a vapor upon release.  The remaining product will form aerosol droplets.  The aerosol results in a very dense cloud of vapor and liquid droplets, with dispersion characteristics significantly different than for a cloud of pure chlorine gas.\n\nB.  Only  the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  The plume area, or footprint, is approximatley six percent of the full circle.\n\nThe EPA mandated meterological conditions, Stability F wind speed of 1.5 m/second , higfhest daily maximum temperature and average humidity were used.\n\nMitigation systems to be considered include the chlorine detection system and the vacuum piping. The Valrico AWT chlorine system is a vacuum system.  This system can be expected to significantly reduce the amount of chlorine released in case of a pigtail or piping failure.\n\nThe general HCWD release prevention program is based on several key elements:\n\nTraining of staff.\nPreventative maintenance program.\nState of the art process and safety equipment.\nAccurate, effective operating procedures.\nHazard review of equipment and procedures.\nIn house inspection program.\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) worn by operators during connection/disconnection of the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide supply. Awareness training in hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.   The presence of Chlorine and sulfur dioxide detection equipment.
