Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station is located 3\u00bd miles west of Ft. Lupton, CO on Hwy 52 and 1\u00bd miles south on CR 19.  The Station consists of ten compressors that discharge 100 MMCF/D of gas to delivery points via 16 and 20 pipelines. The discharge pressure is limited to 1,220 psig by the use of automatic shutdowns and relief devices. The station is equipped with two 60,000-gallon inlet slug catchers to separate water and heavier hydrocarbons (called condensate) from the inlet gas stream. These liquids are stored in five 225-barrel storage tanks and hauled from the station via trucks.  There are no toxic chemicals stored or used at this facility.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines.  During this process, it is also necessary to reduce the water dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission. \r\n\r\nThe station receives gas from various gathering lines.  This low-pressure inlet gas is then compressed which causes some of the water and heavier hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower water and hydrocarbon dew point.  To lower the dew point further, the gas is dried using a regenerative liquid desiccant called Tri-ethylene glycol (TEG).  This is necessary because as the gas flows through the discharge pipeline, its temperature will d"

The investigation team documents it findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to management for resolution. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo guarantee that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Western Midstream conducts audits to determine that the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Frederick Compressor Station have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulates substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Frederick compressor station. Collectively these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station has safety features to help 1) contain/control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequence of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\n- Release Detection \r\n- Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms \r\n- Remote monitoring during periods when the stat"

The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup. In addition the station has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency equipment. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed during an emergency scenario.

The processes at the plant are regulated by Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and Occupational Safety, and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the station's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program. In addition, the PSM program requires that process and employee safety issues be addressed as part of normal operations. These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, participation in flow sheet reviews, management of change, and safe work practices.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.

These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. If necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained at the area office. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate. The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Frederick Compressor Station has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a p"

Examples of these include:\r\n\r\n1)control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \r\n2)a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \r\n3)procedures for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, \r\n4)Hot Work permit to control spark producing activities, and \r\n5)permits and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are  reviewed to: \r\n\r\n1)ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, \r\n2)verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and \r\n3)ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process. \r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process-operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, or significant environmental loss or person"

      "SummaryText": "rocess. New employees receive basic training in compressor station operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Western Midstream has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n1)perform their work in a safe manner, \r\n2)have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\r\n3)are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \r\n4)understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \r\n5)understand and follow site safety rules,\r\n6)inform compressor station personnel of any hazards that they find during their work, and \r\n7)know and use Stop Work authority if conditions or activities warrant.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with: \r\n1)process overview, \r\n2)information about safety and health hazards, \r\n3)emergency response plan requirements, \r\n4)safe work practices prior to their beginning work, \r\n5)safe and hot work permits as required.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the company has a program in place that evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Frederick Compressor Station conducts a PSSR for any new equipment or facility"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by requiring verification that accident prevention requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nWestern Midstream has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: \r\n\r\n1)conducting training, \r\n2)developing written procedures, \r\n3)performing inspections and tests, \r\n4)correcting identified deficiencies, and \r\n5)applying quality assurance measures. \r\n\r\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.
