Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Frederick Compressor Station is located 3? miles west of Ft. Lupton, CO on Hwy 52 and 1? miles south on CR 19.  The Station consists of ten compressors that discharge 100 MMCF/D of gas to delivery points via 16\" and 20\" pipelines. The discharge pressure is limited to 1,220 psig by the use of automatic shutdowns and relief devices. The station is equipped with two 60,000-gallon inlet slug catchers to separate water and heavier hydrocarbons (called condensate) from the inlet gas stream. These liquids are stored in five 225-barrel storage tanks and hauled from the station via trucks.  There are no toxic chemicals stored or used at this facility.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines.  During this process, it is also necessary to reduce the water dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission. \n\n\n\nThe station receives gas from various gathering lines.  This low-pressure inlet gas is then compressed which causes some of the water and heavier hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower water and hydrocarbon dew point.  To lower the dew point further, the gas is dried using a regenerative liquid desiccant called Tri-ethylene glycol (TEG).  This is necessary because as the gas flows through the discharge pipeline, its temperature will d"

If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will condense and the resulting liquids will restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe. In extreme cold, the liquids may form hydrates, a potentially dangerous ice plug. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. The processes at the plant are regulated by Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and Occupational Safety, and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nWestern Midstream requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the station's accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program. In addition, the PSM program requires that process and employee safety issues be addressed as part of normal operations. These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, participation in flow sheet reviews, management of change, and safe work practices.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nWestern Midstream keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equip"

The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The compressor station has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals. The compressor station ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) as well as remote monitoring of pressures and flows into and out of the facility.\n\n\n\nWestern Midstream maintains technical documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nWestern Midstream has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The station and its components are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. If necessary, the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained at the area office. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Frederick Compressor Station maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate. The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Frederick Compressor Station has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a p"
