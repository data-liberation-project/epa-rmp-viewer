      "SummaryText": "s established under 40 CFR 68.   However, as might be expected, 10 out of 14 refinery processes have the potential and are likely to contain more than 10,000 lbs of flammable mixtures.  Most of the flammable substances, such as feedstocks, motor fuels and LPG are stored in the refinery?s tank farm.  Other refinery processes have flammable substances held principally in process vessels and interconnecting piping.  The 10 refinery processes described below are subject to the containment and control measures mandated by the refinery?s RMP for flammable mixtures.     \n\n1.    Tank Farm:  The Tank Farm (TKF) contains many petroleum storage tanks, including vertical tanks, pressurized horizontal tanks (bullets) and one sphere.  Stored products include crude oil, fuel oils, diesel, kerosene, gasoline, naphtha, , butane and propane.  The butane and propane is stored in pressurized tanks which have deluge systems in case of fire.  All vertical tanks are diked to contain releases.  Foam is also available for tank fires.     \n\n2.    Crude Distillation:  Crude oil is washed to remove salt, heated and then distilled in the atmospheric distillation tower  referred to as the crude distillation unit (CDU) into naphtha, kerosene, diesel, atmospheric gas oils (middle distillates), and residual oil . The heavier oils from the CDU are further processed by vacuum distillation (VDU).  The RMP does not address the VDU as a separate process since it does not contain 10,000 pounds of a covered flammable mixture.  However, the VDU was included in the CDU HAZOP which was conducted for PSM and RMP .  The naphtha and other light ends coming off the top of the atmospheric tower are covered by the RMP as a flammable mixture.  The hazards associated with the CDU include high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and chemicals such as caustic used to treat the kerosene.  The CDU also contains the sour water stripper (SWS).  Steam is used in the SWS  to strip ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S"

      "SummaryText": ") from water containing ammonium hydrosulfide.  The H2S and NH3 are sent to the Sulfur Recovery Units discussed below.\n\n3.    Visbreaking:  The heavy residual oils from the bottom of the VDU tower are processed in the visbreaker (VBK) by viscosity breaking at high temperature.  This results in breakdown of the heavy oil to produce fuel gas, naphtha and lighter oils.  The hazards associated with this process are again high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, gases containing ~10% H2S. For the purposes of the RMP the greatest concern is with the release and subsequent ignition of flammable mixtures.\n\n4.    Distillate Hydrocracker:  In the hydrocracker (DHC), gas oils from the CDU and VDU are mixed with hydrogen and sent to a series of catalytic reactors where nitrogen and sulfur are removed and the oils are cracked and reacted with hydrogen to form diesel, kerosene, naphtha and lighter gaseous products.  Some of the reactions in these reactors are exothermic and the potential exists for a runaway reaction.  Process controls minimize this possibility and provide for rapid pressure reduction by dumping the reactors to the flare to protect against accidents.  Following the reactors, vapor-liquid separation and hydrogen recovery occur.  The liquid is then reheated before going to a fractionation tower for diesel, kerosene and naphtha separation.  Additional hazards include H2S and NH3 up to 5% in some gaseous streams, high temperature and pressure of the hydrocarbons, and flammable mixtures.\n\n5.    Amine Treatment Unit:  In the ATU, H2S in gaseous and liquid petroleum (LPG) hydrocarbon streams is absorbed using and amine solutions.  The H2S rich amine  is then stripped using steam producing a sour (90+% H2S stream) that is sent to the sulfur recovery unit. Although the amount of H2S never approaches 10,000 pounds, Tesoro considers the H2S to present a significant risk, and treats it accordingly.  H2S ambient monitors are strategically placed to pick up any leak.  This pr"

Light Ends Recovery Unit:  The LERU is a collection of four fractionating columns \ndesigned to separate and purify the lighter products for sale or reuse.  Methane \nand ethane are used as fuel gas, butane and light naphtha are used for gasoline \nblending, and propane is sold separately.  There are no fired heaters in this unit.  \nThe unit contains large amounts of light flammable hydrocarbons in addition to \nthe hazards of high temperature and pressure. \n\n7.      Catalytic Reforming Unit:  This unit includes the naphtha hydrotreater (NHT) \nwhere sulfur and nitrogen are removed from the naphtha using hydrogen at high \ntemperature and pressure.  The sulfur must be removed to prevent poisoning of \nthe catalyst in the reformer (CRU).  The reformer consists of a series of reactors \nusing platinum catalysts to reform naphtha into reformate with increased \naromatics and higher octane for gasoline blending.  In addition to flammable \nmixtures, hazards in the NHT/CRU include exothermic reactions, high \ntemperature and pressure, H2S and hydrogen.  The hydrogen generated in the \nCRU is used in the DHC.    \n\n8.    Cogeneration Unit:  The CGU consists of a combustion turbine power generating                                                            unit combined with a waste heat boiler to produce steam.

Flare System:  The refinery flare serves an emergency relief device for the \nprocess units described above. The flare system consists of the various flare \nheaders throughout the process areas and two knockout drums.  The flare \nsystem transports gases from pressure safety relief valves to the flare for safe \ncombustion.  There is little potential for fire or explosion because the flare \noperates at very low pressures and is itself a control device.\n\n10.    Wastewater Treatment Unit:  The wastewater treatment unit (WTU) receives oily \nwaste water from the refinery process units.  The WTU separates oil from water \nwastewater and also strips dissolved hydrocarbons from the wastewater, prior to \nbiotreatment in the activated slude unit .  Liquid hydrocarbons are stored in a \nrecovered oil tank and recycled back into the process.  Stripped hydrocarbons \nare burned in a thermal oxidizer to prevent air pollution.  The WTU  is a covered \nRMP process  because light product can be stored in the recovered oil tank \nwhich poses a flammability risk.  \n\nBased on engineering review, the four processes listed below do not have flammable mixtures or contain toxic substances in excess of the threshold quantities established by 40 CFR 68. Nonetheless they are subject to the refinery?s PSM program which embodies many of the same elements as RMP.\n\n1.    Sulfur Recovery Units/Tail Gas Unit:  The SRU receives acidic gases (NH3 and H2S) principally from the SWS and the ATU. The feed gas to SRU are, for all practical purposes, void of hydrocarbon and generally are not characterized as a flammable mixture.   Ammonia is therma"

The Sulfur Recovery Plant (SRP) also includes the Shell Claus Offgas Treater (SCOT) or Tail Gas Treating (TGU) is used to remove residual sulfur compounds from the flue or tail gas of the SRU.  A tail gas incinerator provides the final control.\n\n2.    Hydrogen Generating Unit:  A hydrogen plant produces hydrogen that is used primarily in the hydrocracker.  The hydrogen is produced by reacting steam with light hydrocarbons (butane, LPG) in the presence of a catalyst.  In addition to the potential for combustion of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons, the methanation reaction to remove small amounts of CO and CO2 is highly exothermic and presents the possibility of a runaway reaction.  \n\n3.    Asphalt Heating and Loading:  In 2006 the refinery suspended the process producing asphalt by air blowing in the Asphalt Manufacturing Unit (AMU).  The asphalt oxidizer (R801) as know as the air blower and the waste gas incinerator (H802) were taken out-of-service.  Aside from the asphalt loading rack which is used to fill trucks and inter-island container, there is a refinery fuel gas-fired heater which is used to keep asphalt warn so that is can be pumped and transferred.\n\n4.    Fuel Treatment Plant:  The fuel treatment plant (FTP) is used principally to remove impurities from fuel oil, which is routinely sold to a large independent Cogeneration Facility which borders the refinery.  There are no fired heaters used in this process and throughout the treatment the fuel oil would not be considered flammable.\n\nToxic Substances: Toxic substances generated as a by-product of refining processes include Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), Ammonia (NH4), and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2).  Although theses hazardous substances exist at the refinery, they are not stored in tanks or retained in the process in quantities which would exceed of the RMP regulatory threshold level.  Since theses toxics substances are not p"

However, they have been fully addressed throughout our safety program and potential release scenarios have been analyzed and mitigation measures taken.  Means to prevent and mitigate impacts from these releases is addressed in Tesoro's PSM program and Emergency Response Plan.\n\nFlammable Mixtures: The refining industry produces flammable mixtures as part of its main business and therefore has a significant potential for explosion and fire. As noted above, at Tesoro?s  Kapolei refinery ,10 of the 14  processes listed above  contain flammable mixtures in excess of 10,000 lbs. Most of the flammable mixtures are stored in the tankfarm.\n\nRelease Scenarios  (Worst Case and Alternatives)\n\nUnder the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations, if any process stores toxic or flammable substance above EPA's threshold quantities, the refinery must determine the worst-case accidental release (defined as the release resulting in the greatest downwind impact) for that substance. Only a very limited subset of mitigation measures may be considered in projecting the impact of a worst-case scenario.  While EPA strictly defines the worst-case scenario, alternative cases that may be more likely to occur may be presented, and are more likely to be the subject of HAZOPs and drills.\n\nWorst-case Scenario: The worst-case scenario would involve the release, dispersion and ultimately and explosion a 30,000 gallons butane bullet in the tank farm. (The butane is less than 99% pure and consequently is classified as a flammable mixture for the purposes of RMP but was modeled as butane for the offsite consequences analysis.) The worst-case scenario assumes the entire 25,650 contents of the bullet is released as a gas over a 10 minute period and is then involved in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  Based on EPA guidance, the endpoint (impact distance) of the worst-case VCE is estimated at 0.4 miles, using a TNT-equivalent model.  Previo"

      "SummaryText": "usly butane was stored in one the Cogen bullets.  The bullets in the CGU are no longer used to store butane.  As a result, the theoretical release point shifted to a butane bullet of comparable size in the southwest tank farm.  The worst-case release scenario provides approximately the same end-point impact distance as before, but because the release is presumed to be emanating from the SW tank farm rather than the CGU, a somewhat different group of neighboring commercial facilities could be potentially impacted.  The closest facility to a butane-filled bullet is no longer Ball Corporation but rather the Kalaeloa Cogen facility, which borders the refinery on the west. \n\nEven in a worst-case scenario, there are still no nearby residences that could be impacted.  Likewise, no sensitive environmental receptors would be impacted under the  worst-case scenario.  The public receptors are commercial enterprises and offices located closest to the refinery   The worst-case scenario does not take into account the effects of mitigations measures which presumably would be rendered ineffective. For example, the tank farm bullet has a deluge system on it to mitigate the effects of a fire.  The vessel is also isolated and inspected and tested according to industry standards to prevent failure.    \n\nThe Alternative Case:  A number of processes and circumstances were reviewed and evaluated before identifying the alternative case.  The alternative case represented by a two inch hole or line connection from a 25,650 gallon propane (C3) bullet also located in the SW tank farm.   Utilizing the more conservative of two dispersion modeling approaches ( ALOHA and EPA Offsite Consequences Analysis Table 29) the vapor cloud is expected to be blown (by 10 mph winds) 528 feet from the point of release .  Subsequent ignition and explosion of the cloud could cause an impact 465 feet away.  Consequently the total hazard distance for the alternative case was estimated at 993 ft (.19) or roughly 50"

The PSM program includes the entire refinery, and is not limited to processes that contain a threshold quantity of a regulated chemical.  Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) are completed by professionals on all refinery processes and repeated every five years as a minimum.  This assures that design standards are adequate for safe operations, and that controls are installed and address all identified hazards. Note that the great majority of actions identified in the HAZOP are addressed as quickly as practicable.  Some items however require long lead times due to design requirements or other work necessary to determine a solution.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) ensure that any change in materials, equipment or procedures is thoroughly reviewed for safety and risk.  A mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained, inspected and tested using manufacturers and industry standards.  Accidents and near misses are subject to an incident investigation process that ensures actions are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nThis RMP submittal asks for a number of dates to show compliance with various elements of the prevention program.  We have tried to provide the latest dates; however, the program is dynamic and many dates will have changed as we continuously change and update our program.  Computer programs track actions, recommendations and resolutions to completion for the HAZOPs, MOCs, PSSRs, incident investigations and the mechanical integrity program. \n\nAccident History\n\nThe refinery has not experienced a fire, explosion or other incident involving a flammable mixture that has generated any off-site consequences "

      "SummaryText": "within the last five years.  In fact, there has not been a fire with offsite consequences since the refinery was built in 1972.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response program is designed around the Incident Command System (ICS) and is used for all types of emergencies.  Training and drills are held routinely to test response, communication, coordination and training.  Drills range from routine un-announced checks of the call in system to scheduled all day drills involving other Tesoro locations and response agencies.  The refinery maintains a well-trained Fire Brigade with a full range of response equipment. \n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThe refinery routinely makes changes to procedures, equipment, training programs and materials in order to improve safety and reduce environmental impacts.  These changes are made as a result of HAZOP studies, accident and near-miss investigations, safety inspections, pre-startup reviews and audits.  The refinery is currently follows a behavior based program to improve safety awareness of all employees.  Throughout it's safety programs, a key objective is continuous improvement through involvement at all employee levels."
