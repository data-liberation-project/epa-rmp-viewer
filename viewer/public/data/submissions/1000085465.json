              "Description": "Empire Kosher Poultry is required to develop and implement a release prevention program because the plan meets the eligibility requirements for Program 3 under the Risk Management Plan.  Empire Kosher Poultry qualifies for Program 3 based on the Offsite Consequence Analysis which indicated the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is farther than the distance to a public receptor.  In addition, the anhydrous ammonia process at Empire Kosher Poultry is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  As such, Program 3 eligibility requirements necessitate that the facility put into practice a release prevention program to help minimize the impacts should a release occur from the ammonia system.  A description of the specific components of this Prevention Program can be found in the following sections.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEach facility subject to the RMP regulations must develop a program to ensure that regulated substances are used and handled in a safe manner, and procedures and equipment are in place to detect and reduce the impact of a potential release on employees, the environment and the public. Based on information in Section 4 - Process Safety Information of the PSM Program, the ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with a number of safety and control devices that can be utilized in the event of a release or event involving the ammonia system. These include the following: Manual shut-off capabilities; Safety relief valves; Excess flow check valves; Level and pressure gauges; and    Piping and tank design according to ASME standards.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the OSHA PSM requirements, and Part 68.75 for Management of Change, any modifications to the system that meet the criteria in either regulation would be properly documented and maintained in Section 12 of the Process Safety Program for the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\nAs a toxic gas, ammonia has the potential to produce acute and chronic human health effects. Additional harmful effects may arise from equipment failure or overfilling of the storage tanks. The prevention program in place at Empire Kosher Poultry addresses these issues.  Standard operating procedures for the facility implement safe practices to reduce the possibilities of a release.  This includes maintenance of equipment as well as proper training of employees.  A process hazards analysis (PHA) will be performed once every five (5) years, or upon a major modification of the system as outlined in Section 5 ? Process Hazard Analysis of the facility?s Process Safety Management Program.  The PHA was last updated on October 29, 2015 for the all three (3) anhydrous ammonia systems and a copy is provided in Process Safety Management documentation.  The PHA is scheduled to be updated prior to the five (5) year anniversary of the last review date.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nStandard operating procedures for the following operations are included in Section 6 ? Operating Procedures of the Process Safety Management Program: Initial start-up; Normal operations/temporary operations; Emergency shutdown; Normal shutdown; Normal start-up; \n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) Coordinator will have the responsibility to ensure that the operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect current operating practices; including changes in technology, equipment and facilities.  The Standard Operating Procedure Team, whose members are listed in Section 3 - Employee Involvement of the Empire Kosher Poultry PSM Program, will review the operating practices on an annual basis.  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmpire Kosher Poultry has developed an employee involvement program that encourages all employees to participate in the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system; the specifics can be reviewed in Section 3 of the Process Safety Management Program.  The participation by the facility employees is included in one of the following categories: Awareness; Involvement; Access to information.\n\n\n\nAll employees of Empire Kosher Poultry potentially affected or affected by the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system shall be made aware of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management (RMP) programs implemented at the Mifflintown, PA facility.  Those employees directly involved with the maintenance and operation of the system shall be involved with the development and execution of the program.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nHuman factors are critical to the safe operation and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  It is vital that all employees of Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. have a general awareness of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Section 7 ? Training of the Process Safety Management Program outlines the associated training for the facility in regards to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  This section indicates the training requirements for the following: New employees; Current employees; Operators; Contractors.\n\n\n\nMaintenance-Mechanical Integrity\n\nAn important component of the prevention program is the mechanical integrity program, which includes routine maintenance inspections of the storage tanks and associated ammonia refrigeration equipment.  The preventive maintenance program at Empire Kosher Poultry includes an inventory of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system that is based in the Maintenance Department on the PMC computerized work order system.\n\n\n\nThe facility currently conducts inspections of the ammonia system on a varied schedule that includes: daily, regularly scheduled and other.  These inspections are discussed in Section 10 ? Mechanical Integrity of the Empire Kosher Poultry Process Safety Management Program. \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe purpose of the Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is to ensure that important considerations have been addressed before any anhydrous ammonia is introduced to the refrigeration system.  This will ensure that safety measures are in place and functional.  Empire Kosher Poultry has developed a procedure to ensure that the required reviews occur on all new facilities and for all modifications that result in a change to the Process Safety Information or after a prolonged shutdown.  The procedure is outlined in Section 9 ? Pre-Startup Safety Review of the Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe management of Empire Kosher Poultry has developed this program to ensure that proposed changes to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system are evaluated and approved before being implemented and that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented.  This helps ensure that the safety of employees, the public, and the environment is maintained when changes to plant operations are being implemented.  It also satisfies the requirements through confirmations that the following are reviewed: The technical basis for a change is appropriate; Safety and health impacts of a change are understood; Procedures are modified as appropriate for a change; The permissible time period is established for temporary changes; and Appropriate personnel authorize a change.  \n\n\n\nFurthermore, management of change (MOC) procedures ensure that employees and contract employees are informed of, and trained in, changes before placing changed equipment into service and that process safety information and operating/maintenance/emergency procedures are updated as appropriate.  The MOC program details can be located in Section 12 ? Management of Change of the Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nEmpire Kosher Poultry?s Contractors Qualifications program, Section 8 of the PSM Program, applies to all contractors and their employees that perform any type of work ON or IN THE VICINITY of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The program does not apply to contractors providing services that do not directly affect the safety of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Examples of services that do not apply would include but are not limited to laundering, janitorial and landscaping.  The program includes the following procedures: Contractor selection ? pre bid; Contractor selection ? post bid; Contractor responsibilities; Compliance audits.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit Program\n\nEmpire Kosher Poultry has developed a Hot Work Permit Program for the Mifflintown, PA facility that is in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.252.  The Manager of Safety and Risk Management is the owner of this document and is required to provide updates as necessary.  The facility?s Hot Work Permit Program can be reviewed in Attachment A of Section 11 ? Hot Work Permit of the Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nEmpire Kosher Poultry Inc. will conduct compliance audits of the prevention program once every three years in conjunction with the process safety management requirements.  The most recent compliance audits were conducted in February 2020.  Compliance audits are performed as outlined in Section 15 ? Compliance Audits of the Empire Kosher Poultry Process Safety Management Program.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nIn the event that an accidental release or a near miss should occur at the station, facility personnel will conduct an incident investigation.  Such investigations are required for events that may lead to, or have the possibility to cause, a catastrophic release of ammonia.  The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the incident, formulate corrective actions, and verify that those actions are carried out.  Investigations are required to begin within 48 hours after the reported incident.  Records of the investigation and documentation of corrective actions will be maintained at the facility for a minimum of five years. Section 13 ? Incident Investigation of the Empire Kosher Poultry Process Safety Management Program outlines the procedure and forms that will be utilized to perform an investigation.  The RMP incident history recordkeeping requirement covers only certain releases: Must be from a covered process (regulated substance held above its threshold quantity); Must have caused at least one of the following (per 40 CFR 68.42(a)): On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or Offsite deaths/injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility?s Manager of Safety and Risk Management maintains an Integrated Emergency Action Plan (IEAP) on file. According to the IEAP, facility employees responsible for responding to incidental releases of ammonia, all members of the Response Team have been trained to the Hazardous Materials Technician Level according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29 CFR 1910.120 ? Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazwoper).  In the case of a significant ammonia release, the plan prescribes procedures for emergency notification, evacuation and assembly areas.  The most recent update of the EAP was completed in September 2019.  The facility employees are trained in the implementation of the EAP through annual drills.  The Integrated Emergency Action Plan contains the following: Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance; and Procedures to review and update the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n\n\nManagement Program\n\nThe owner or operator of a stationary source with processes subject to Program 3 must develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements. This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the Risk Management Plan elements.\n\n\n\nIf any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals need to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document. For Empire Kosher Poultry, Connie McAteer ? Environmental Manager, has been assigned the overall responsibility for the RMP program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nBased on discussions with plant personnel, the facility has not experienced any accidental releases of ammonia in the past five years.  Any accidental releases from the system would be investigated and recorded in accordance with the requirements found in 68.81 of the risk management regulations.  The Environmental Manager will be responsible to update the risk management plan below for any reportable incidents that occur.  The updates must be made within six months of the date of the incident.  \n\n",
