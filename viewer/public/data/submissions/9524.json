The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nDole Fresh Vegetables has established a Plant Safety Program for it's Springfield Ohio facility. This program includes the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, title 29CFR 1910.119) and the EPA's Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Accidental Release Prevention, title 40CFR Part 68). \n\nB: Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Company operates a value-added food processing facility(NAICS #311991 Perishable Prepared Food Manufacturing) at this address..  \nThe facility operates one single stage ammonia refrigeration system, that provides cooling of the process area as well as chilling of process water. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7664-41-7) contained in this refrigeration system is 30,000 pounds. The refrigeration system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \n\nThe facility also operates a chlorinator induction system utilizing one ton containers of chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5) connected to the system. This chlorinator system has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine and is therefore subject to the OSHA and EPA compliance programs.  The chlorine system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM Program.\n\nC: Summary of Worst-case and Alternative Release"

In the cases of significant discrepancies other modeling programs were used and compared against the results of RMP*Comp(r) and the highest value were plotted on the OCA maps.\n\n\nAbout Landview and Census data:\n\n\tLandView is a government-developed mapping and a database-linking program and is commercially available.

Pamphlet #162) published by the Chlorine Institute. After discussion with experts on chlorine air dispersion modeling, it was decided that the more conservative values from this document would be used in the OCA models.\n\tThe basic structure of this section of the Risk Management Plan is taken directly from the Code of Federal Regulations Title 40 part 68 and its interpretations as outline in the above sited texts and other sources. In 40 CFR 68.22 the requirements are spelled out for the dispersion modeling of the worst case and alternative scenarios. The toxic end points (EPRG-2) are required as the level set by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). This is \"the maximum airborne concentration in which it is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.\" \n\t40CFR 68 also requires that all worst case air dispersion models use the prescribed wind speed and atmospheric stability class, the largest expected storage vessel (or the largest expected pipe or container; which ever has the greatest off-site impact), ambient humidity/temperature, and that a ground level release event is modeled.
