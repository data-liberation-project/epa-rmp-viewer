The Hattiesburg Water & Sewer Department accidental release prevention polcy involves operational\nprocedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases. Continued\nimprovement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases.The emergency response policy\ninvolves procedures to noify and coordinate response with local responders.\n\nB. Hattiesburg South Lagoon is one of two wastewater treatment facilities serving the City of Hattiesburg,\nMississippi. Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the wastewater at this location after it has been treated. Sulfur Dioxide is used to remove the chlorine residual. This facility is located in the southeastern section of the city at 1903 E. Hardy St. The maximum amount of chlorine at this facility would be six one-ton containers. The maximum amount Sulfur Dioxide would be three one-ton containers. This facility routinely checked five days a week.\n\nC. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine and two sulfur dioxide release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative scenario\". Both scenarios were calculated using EPA's RMP* Comp software.\n\nFor Chlorine, the Worst case scenario nvolves a failure of a one ton Chlorine cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a release rate of 110 pounds per minute. This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. The offsite consequence of this scenario are as follows:\n1. Topography: Urbann Surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area.)\n2. Toxic Endpoint: 0.0087 mg/l; basis:ERPG-2\n3. Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.9 miles (1.4 Kilometers)\n4. Residential Population Estimate: 2075\nThe Meteoroogical assumptions about this scenario are:\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4miles/hour)\nStability Class: F\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\n\nThe alternate release scenario involve"
