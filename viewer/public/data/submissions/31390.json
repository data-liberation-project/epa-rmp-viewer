      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe health and well being of every employee and the surrounding community is of vital importance to the Valley Forge Sewer Authority (VFSA).  Accordingly, the Authority strives to maintain its facilities in a safe manner.   This program has been especially successful with respect with our chlorination system as indicated the fact that there has not ever been an accident or leak of chlorine from the start up of our chlorination facilities in 1976 that has resulted in injury of any person, or migration of chlorine gas from the chlorination facility.\n\nThe Valley Forge Sewer Authority provides sewage collection, conveyance and treatment for communities located in eight townships all located in Chester County Pennsylvania.  The VFSA is an operating Authority created in 1968 by Charlestown, East Pikeland, and Schuylkill Townships.  The Authority is the owner and operator of a 9.2 million gallon per day wastewater treatment plant located at 333 Pawling Road, RD #1, Phoenixville, PA, 19460.  In addition to providing service to the charter townships the Authority's treatment plant receives sewage from Easttown township, East Whiteland Township, Malvern Borough, Tredyffrin Township, and Willistown Township.  The VFSA employs 26 full-time professionals to operate and maintain the wastewater collection conveyance and treatment facilities in accordance with Permit Number PA 0043974 issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). A condition of the PADEP permit is that the VFSA provide treated wastewater disinfection to eliminate the potential of adverse effects from microorganisms in the treated effluent.  In order to meet these conditions for treated wastewater disinfection, the VFSA utilizes chlorine as an additive to the treated wastewater.  Chlorine is purchased in one ton cylinders that meet the specifications of the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Chlorine Institute.  The maximum number of containers at the VFSA facili"

The chlorination system has been designed, sized, and installed in a manner that is appropriate and in accordance with good engineering practice.  \n\n\nThe VFSA is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 pertaining to risk management planning (RMP Rule) because it uses chlorine in quantities that are above the regulatory thresholds. \nAs part of an upgrade to accommodate new customers, the chlorination system has been improved in late 1999 to early 2000.  These upgrades  improved upon our existing system and further reduce any risk of an accident.  The improvements consist of: \n\n? Providing new trunnions for chlorine cylinders to allow for easier movement of potential leading cylinders to move leaks to the gas portion of the cylinder.  \n? Modifying cylinder-lifting tools to allow chlorine to be delivered via two separate locations thereby eliminating the need to lift cylinders and move them above cylinders that are in operation.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe elements of the Prevention Program for the VFSA chlorination system consists of the following components:\n\n? Safety Information\n? Hazard Review\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training\n? Maintenance of Equipment\n? Compliance Audits\n\nWhereas incident investigation would normally be a component of a Program 2 system, the VFSA has not experienced any incidents involving leaks of chlorine.  Accordingly, although the mechanisms are in place for incident investigation, such investigations have not been necessary to date.  The following provides a summary of each element of Prevention Program as implemented by the VFSA.\n\nSafety Information\n\nmaterial safety data sheets\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided and maintained for review by those individuals that may come in contact with chlorine or chlorination equipment.  The MSDS information is posted in the chlorine facilities, in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and in the Wastewater Treatment Plant Emergency Response Plans, maintained at the"

Of course, on going operator-training programs assure that individuals are thoroughly trained in the potential hazards associated with chlorine as well as all chemicals handled at the facility.\n\nmaximum intended inventory\n\nMaximum intended inventory at the facility consists of nine (9) one ton chlorine cylinders. Design upgrades for the chlorination facility will include the modification of chlorine delivery and return of empty containers. Chlorine cylinders must be ordered before they are delivered to the facility.  Therefore, the inventory may never exceed the maximum intended inventory.\n\nstorage and process limits\n\nThe chlorine is handled in electrically heated facilities.  Thermostats control the temperature in these facilities, and the relatively low capacity of the heaters would prevent the excessive heating of the one ton chlorine cylinders. However, there are no potentially flammable chemicals or potential sources of fire in or around the chlorination facility that would result in such an occurrence.\n\nPressure in the piping from the chlorine cylinders to the vacuum regulators is controlled by the vacuum regulators, which are part of the system.  The amount of pressure that can build up upstream of the pressure regulator is limited by the vapor pressure of the chlorine in the cylinder.  The upstream piping, which is under pressure, may only be subjected to the pressure generated by the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the cylinder. This vapor pressure is a function of the substance in the cylinder (chlorine) and the ambient temperature.  This pressure is well within the pressure rating of the piping.\n\nAll piping downstream of the pressure regulators is under vacuum.  The vacuum is produced by an eductor, and the amount of vacuum produced is limited by the size of the eductor, and the eductor's water supply, which is limited by the capacity of the pump supplying water to the eductor.  These are single speed pumps, which can supply only one flow"

The amount of vacuum produced is well within the vacuum rating of the piping.\n\ncodes standards and equipment specifications\n\nAll components of the chlorination system have been designed and installed in a manner that is appropriate to its intended service.  Piping is in accordance with American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) standards.  Chlorine cylinders are designed in accordance with DOT specification 106A500X.   Vacuum regulators, chlorine detectors, eductors, heaters, lights, exhaust ventilators, and doors were designed by reputable manufacturers such as Bailey Fischer, and Porter specifically for use in chlorination systems, as are all other components of the system.  System components were sized and designed in accordance with their capacity and good engineering practice.  Manufacturer literature on system components is maintained at the VFSA facility.\n\nupdates\n\nSafety information is updated when major changes to the facility are made.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA Hazard Review was conducted  in May of 1999, and updated in April of 2004  The VFSA utilized both checklists and an on site review of facilities.  As a result of the 1999 hazard review, the VFSA identified several possible upgrades to the system.  \n\n\n? Providing new trunnions for chlorine cylinders to allow for easier movement of potential leading cylinders to move leaks to the gas portion of the cylinder.  \n? Modifying cylinder-lifting tools to allow chlorine to be delivered via two separate locations thereby eliminating the need to lift cylinders and move them above cylinders that are in operation.\n? Providing new state of the art monitoring equipment to monitor and alarm if leaks are detected.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures for the chlorination facilities are maintained in the comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures for the VFSA.

The initial training for chlorination includes on the job training where inexperienced operators are accompanied by experienced operators when performing any task having to do with the chlorination equipment.  It is only when the Operations Manager is satisfied that the newly trained employee is totally capable of safely performing the tasks, that he is given that responsibility.  \n\nMaintenance\n\nAll equipment at the VFSA is part of a preventative maintenance (PM) program.  There is a computer program, that includes a compilation of maintenance SOPs, and a PM schedule.   All PM frequencies are at least as frequent as those provided in the manufacturer's operations and maintenance manual.  Critical equipment such as vacuum regulators, chlorine monitors, and cylinder connections are checked on a daily basis. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance Audits are implemented in accordance with the RMP requirements at least once every three years.  This is to include checklists, a facility walk through, discussions with employees, and documentation of findings of the audit.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has not been an accidental release of chlorine since the chlorination system started up in 1976. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe VFSA has an emergency response plan that was developed in 1996, and periodically updated.  This \"Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan is a requirement of PA Code 25, Chapters 101.3 and 78.55.  The purpose of the PPC Plan is to minimize and abate hazards to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or release of hazardous waste to air, soil, or surface water.
