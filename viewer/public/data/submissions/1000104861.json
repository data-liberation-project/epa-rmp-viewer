The Tampa LP Terminal is an on-shore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Tampa, FL.  The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel/#2 Fuel Oil, butane, ethanol, asphalt and various other petroleum based additives.\n\nTampa LP Terminal - MPLX Terminals, LLC (Marathon) in Tampa, FL is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner.  Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\n\nThe Tampa LP Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community.  Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Marathon has designed and implemented including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\nA.

Tampa LP Terminal - Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Tampa LP Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular/blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via an automated analyzer and process controls. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, fusible elements on pneumatic valves (fail safe), fill shutoff on the vessel, manual and automatic emergency shutoff devices on the system, HMI system display at terminal office, pressure and hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Tampa LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors as governed by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe Tampa LP Terminal accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning/response programs help Marathon effectively manage the hazards posed by the regulated substance to the Terminal employees, surrounding public, and environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29CFR 1910.119.  MPLX Terminals, LLC is also volu"

The Tampa LP Terminal and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Marathon also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of the Terminal's operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help prevent, identify, contain/control, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation;\n-Redundant control systems with battery back-ups;\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices;\n-Limited/secured facility access;\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\n-Routinely schedule"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, an Emergency Response Action Plan (ERAP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with Tampa Fire Rescue and Hillsborough County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Tampa LP Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The Terminal maintains records for all incidental and significant chemical releases inclusive of any root cause analyses and associated, follow-up actions. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nD.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nMarathon is continually striving to make the Tampa LP Terminal the safest and most reliable workplace possible for its employees, neighbors and community.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Marathon actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements.  All Process Safety Events (as identified in API 754) are electronically recorded, reviewed, and/or investigated via a root cause analysis (TapRooT).  The Tampa Fire Rescue is contacted annually regarding participation in site emergency response training and/or drills. Additionally, Marathon will work cooperatively with the community, local industry and response agencies to address concerns and emergency preparedness."
