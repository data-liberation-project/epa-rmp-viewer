The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\n\n\nThe top priority of Roger Wood Foods, Inc. is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.  In this effort, Roger Wood Foods, Inc. has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\n\n\n\nThe requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM Standard CFR 1910.119 mirrors that of Risk Management Prevention Program 3 and therefore has been integrated.  Of the 14 PSM elements, 13 focus on accidental release prevention and one on emergency planning and response.  It is the commitment of management and employees to follow the established procedures and seek new ways for improvement. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nThe facility has developed an Emergency Response Plan with the intent to take control of an incident until the Savannah Fire Department arrives on the scene.  Once the Fire Department arrives they will assume the lead role.  Roger Wood Foods, Inc. has designated and trained employees that will assist in the emergency response.  This strategic approach combines the expertise and the response team of the Charlotte Fire Department with the facility and process knowledge of the Roger Wood Foods, Inc. staff.  Roger Wood Foods, Inc. provides annual refresher training and schedules periodic meetings and drills with the Savannah Fire Department.\n\n\n\nCopies of "

The process includes refrigerated spaces that utilize anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS  \n\n\n\nEPA's Risk Management Prevention Program 3, 40 CFR Part 68(D) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 outline the facilities accidental release prevention program.  Included are 13 Chemical Specific Prevention steps implemented by Roger Wood Foods, Inc. and are summarized below.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Employees are given shared responsibility with management in the continued evolution of the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information - Chemical, equipment, and system information has been compiled to ensure the safe design and operation.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - Hazardous Operability Study (HAZOP) completed to identify potential hazards and minimize their impact.\n\nOperating Procedures - Standard Operating Procedures developed to ensure the safe operation of the process.\n\nTraining - Training program established and operators trained to ensure the safe operation of the process.\n\nContractors - Contractor program established to ensure only qualified and trained contractor work on or near the process.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - Procedures and check lists developed to ensure all safety requirements are completed before startup of new or modified process.\n\nMechanical Integrity - Program developed to ensure equipment and systems installed per design specifications and maintained per manufacturer recommendations and good engineering practices.\n\nHot Work Permit - Per"

Two employees were treated by medical responders for ammonia inhalation and chemical burns.  The estimated Ammonia quantity released was 390 pounds.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nRoger Wood Foods, Inc. Emergency Response Program calls for evacuation of the facility in the event of a hazardous chemical emergency.  With the assistance of the Savannah Fire Department, the facility will respond in performing rescue, control and containment, and clean-up operations. The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including hazardous chemical releases. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.
