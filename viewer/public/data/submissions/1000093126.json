      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis Risk Management Program is designed to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68.  This is a relatively new stationary source.  The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia - which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.\n\n\n\nThis is a relatively new process that falls under the RMP regulations due to its ammonia inventory being above the threshold level.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system in this facility has an ammonia inventory of approximately 33,996 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThis process does not meet the requirements of Program 1.  It is subject to OSHA?s PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\n\nThe facility follows a rigorous thirteen volume Ammonia Safety Program to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  This program is also in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119.  Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  The plan has been submitted to the local LEPC.\n\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nThere are some mitigating measures in place.  Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off.  Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation.  The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air outside which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air t"

The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure.  The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the ?Risk Management Program guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration? as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.  Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP.  Following is an overview. \n\n\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.\n\nAs a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater sense of responsibility; they are more likely to catch the problems that can cause accidents.  Employee awareness is for employees not directly involved with the process, this includes knowing the hazards, the safety rules, the warning signs, and evacuation procedures.  All employees have access to the PSM Program.  Involved employees participate directly in every phase of the PSM Program, including conducting the PHA, developing or reviewing operating procedures, reviewing accident investigations, and conducting mechanical integrity and compliance audits.  Community involvement is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire Department and LEPC.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books, manuals, and process information.  These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping.  There are three major categories of information; ammonia data such as SDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletin"

This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact.  The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures - SOPs are provided for each compressor, condenser, ammonia vessel and oil pot, and evaporator.  Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&IDs, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments.  The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup, normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency \n\nshutdowns: and startup following a shutdown.\n\n\n\nTraining - All employees who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the SDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system.

This involves process safety information, process hazards analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition.  These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits - This permit process is to protect against fire, explosion and other dangers resulting from hot work (welding and cutting outside the designated areas).  Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area.  The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met.  Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done.  The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even \"replacement in kind\") be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect.  The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident Investi"

The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed.

The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all areas of the Process Safety Program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.  At a minimum, these must be every three years.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY - LAST FIVE YEARS\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable accidents within the past five years.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY    \n\nNone at this time.\n\n"
