      "SummaryText": "The Mishawaka Wastewater Treatment Plant is committed to promoting a safe operating environment for the facility, its employees, and the surrounding community. The facility has completed its compliance program to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\" for the chlorination and dechlorination processes.  Compliance with this regulation, and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps prevent the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from these processes. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the event that they do occur, and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nThe Mishawaka Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1020 Lincolnway West, Mishawaka, Indiana, 46544. The facility has many distinct processes that treat wastewater prior to discharge to the St. Joseph River. Two of those processes, the chlorination process and the dechlorination process, utilize chemicals regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program Rule: chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The chlorinination process adds chlorine gas to wastewater to reduce bacteria. The dechlorination process adds sulfur dioxide to remove excess chlorine prior to discharge to the St. Joseph River, protecting aquatic life in the river. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton containers. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes each have their own storage and process areas. These processes have been designed in accordance with all local, state, and federal codes. Each process has a gas detection / warning system, providing an alarm should concentration of chlorine or sulfur dioxide exceed 1 part per million. The chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are maintained and operated by personnel certified by the State of Indiana as Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nThe Mishawaka Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed its worst-cas"

      "SummaryText": "e release scenario utilizing EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater facilities.\" The scenario assumes that a ton container has ruptured, and released its contents within a 10-minute period. The release is assumed to take place outdoors. The release of either 2,000 pounds of chlorine or 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide has a toxic endpoint of 1.3 miles. It should be noted that such an incident is highly improbable. Ton containers are inspected by the chemical distributor each time they are filled. They are also hydrostatically tested every five years. Loading and unloading activities are attended by trained operators. Ton containers are immediately transferred from the delivery truck into indoor storage areas. All container handling equipment is inspected regularly, and certified for use annually.\n\nThe Mishawaka Wastewater Treatment Plant has developed its alternative release scenario also utilizing EPA's guidelines. This scenario presumes that a 1/4-inch leak has developed in either the chlorine system or the sulfur dioxide system. This release has a toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles. Again, such an incident is highly improbable, as both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have been designed, installed, and maintained to maximize the mechanical integrity of the piping systems.\n\nThe Mishawaka Wastewater Treatment Plant's emergency response program is based upon the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans. The plan is coordinated with the City of Mishawaka Fire Department."
