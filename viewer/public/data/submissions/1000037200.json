This facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1989 requirements for Anhydrous Ammonia storage. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, notify the Woolstock Volunteer Fire Dept (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannont be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornados, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. \r\n\r\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Woolstock, Iowa location is Dan Schmauss, Location Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency reponse numbers are provided in the Registration Section. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location."

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural corp producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \r\n\r\nThe system consists of storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment and an unidentified number of nurse tanks. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4) of the year). The FTEs for this company locaiton is one (1).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  \r\n\r\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1989 and State Law. In addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Woolstock Fire Dept the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulations, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have cause any deaths , injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous syste"
