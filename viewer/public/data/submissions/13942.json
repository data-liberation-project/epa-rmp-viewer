      "SummaryText": "A.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBlue Bird, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Blue Bird) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Blue Bird to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nBlue Bird's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of minor ammonia releases.\n\nAt Blue Bird anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\n7 Prevent unnecessary human exposure\n7 Reduce the threat to our personnel\n7 Reduce the threat to the community\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nBlue Bird is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located in the city of Wenatchee, county of Chelan, state of Washington.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Blue Bird is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere is 11,700 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system.\n\nBlue Bird uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they are not listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, Blue Bird believes in the concept set forth in the General Duty Clause of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, Blue Bird has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\nC.Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as worst case and alternative scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that the owner or operator s"

      "SummaryText": "hall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \u0005.  The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 6,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room, which is in direct contact with the outside.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 1 mile.  The risk radius extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public and environmental receptors. Although the receiver is inside a room with direct contact to the outside, no mitigation was used.\n\nAlternative scenario - The distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 560 yards.  This is based on a release from the drain at the bottom of the receiver under normal operating conditions. Since this release would occur inside a room with direct wall contact to the outside, building mitigation was used.  A 20% reduction in the amount released was applied. It was also assumed that process safeties would limit the amount released to the ammonia in the receiver.  This scenario was chosen because it gave the greatest distance to the toxic end-point of the releases modeled.  \n\nThe chances of either scenario occurring are unlikely with the automatic safeties on the system.  A more realistic release scenario is a pressure relief valve venting to protect from an overpressure situation.  This would produce a distance to the end-point closer to 155 yards.\n \nD.Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBlue Bird's accidental release prevent program is based on the following key elements:\n7 Training of personnel\n7 Preventative maintenance program\n7 Use of safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nBlue Bird complies with: \n7 OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n7 Washington State's safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62), which are equal to, or more restrictive than OSHA regulations.\n7 IIAR (I"

The operating procedures are kept in the engine room and the refrigeration engineer's office.  These procedures include: \n7 Pre-start up procedures\n7 Routine operations\n7 Maintenance\n7 Response to minor releases\n7 Emergency action plan\n\nE.Five-Year Accident History\n\nBlue Bird has not had any accidents involving ammonia in the last five years.\n\nF.Emergency Response Program\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Blue Bird has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\n\nG.Planned Safety Improvements\n\nBlue Bird plans to install ammonia monitors throughout the areas where the system is located.  The engine room ventilation fan will be connected to an ammonia monitor so that the fan will activate upon reaching a threshold less than 40,000 parts per million, which is < of ammonia's lower explosive limit (LEL)"
