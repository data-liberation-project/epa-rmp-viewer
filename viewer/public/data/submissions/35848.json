All of us must incorporate safety, health, and environmental considerations into our daily business activities. It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\n\nFacility Description:\nThe primary activity at the Portland Plant is the manufacture of chemical additives, including wet strength resins, that are used in the pulp and paper industry.  Epichlorohydrin, is used in the production of wet-strength resins. These resins are used to improve the wet-strength characteristics in a variety of paper applications.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in a chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant primarily receives Epichlorohydrin in tank cars however there is the capability of receiving tank trucks.  Epichlorohydrin is stored in a tank that holds a maximum of 307,700 pounds; the storage tank is provided with a containment dike and leak detectors to minimize adverse impacts from any leaks or spills.  Spill containment capability is also provided for the area where tank trucks and rail cars are unloaded.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nThe process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and has a complete process safety management system in place.  This includes the use  of process hazards analysis to identify and address potential hazards, management of change procedures to control modifications, mechanical integrity procedures for minimizing mechanical failures, detailed operating procedures for process control, and operator training for the personnel involved in the process.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nIn the past five years, the Portland Plant has not had any accidental releases of Epichlorohydrin that have resulted in on-site injuries or damage or any off-site impacts.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Portland Plant has a written emergency response plan and coordinates emergency response matters with the Po"
