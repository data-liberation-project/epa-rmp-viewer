Simplot Co. to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Simplot will also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Unit Director has the responsiblility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures to isolate, ventilate and evacuate.\n\nThe Maintenance Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSimplot's Moses Lake facility produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 33,300 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Moses Lake facility.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Moses Lake facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the Moses Lake facility.  This program contains procedures describing evacuation of facility personnel during an emergency.  For ammonia release type scenarios above a specified concentration, we isolate, ventilate, and evacuate according to the Standard Operating Procedures for Hazardous Non-Routine Tasks.\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAll elements of the Process Safety Management program were evaluated in 2003 and recommendations have been completed or scheduled for completion by the end of year 2007."
