This resubmission adds one additional process to our RMP: bulk storage of 2-methyl-1-butene (RMP flammable chemical) in a laydown area.\n\n                                                                                                                         INTRODUCTION TO RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nNouryon Functional Chemicals LLC produces a variety of products at our Pasadena, Texas facility - organic peroxides for the plastic manufacturing industry.  The facility has three covered processes that use regulated chemicals above the applicability threshold: an organic peroxide manufacturing process contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical); a laydown area contains a 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical); and another organic peroxide manufacturing process utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management is committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n\n\n       Maintaining a staff of onsite safety professionals to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n\n       Providing a dedicated Safety Trainer for monthly employee training;\n\n       Supporting the facility's Behavioral Based Safety Management System; \n\n       Requiring facility to obtain American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care RC 14001 Certification; an Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security Management Systems that addresses various aspects of pollution prevention and process safety management;\n\n       Requiring facility to undergo per"
