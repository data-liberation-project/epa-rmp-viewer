Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFarmers Union Oil Co. of Great Falls, as a local farmer owned cooperative, is committed to providing a safe environment to our employees, neighbors, customers, and the protection of natural resources.  This commitment is shown in our steps taken to prevent accidental releases through facility design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and training of employees.  Control measures are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, we have communicated with the Great Falls Fire Department to provide emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe Farmers Union Oil Co. facility is an anhydrous ammonia storage tank, providing fertilizer for crop production.  The tank, at Highwood  (Figure 1), has a capacity of 30,000 gallons.  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (132,600 pounds) at the maximum filling capacity of 85%.  \n\n3.

In this case the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia tank (132,600 pounds) are assumed to be released in a gaseous form in a period of 10 minutes.
