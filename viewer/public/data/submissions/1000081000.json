Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  \r\nThe primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.    \r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:  \r\nThis facility has developed a worse-case and an alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA.\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  \r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's release prevention program.\r\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Safety Data Sheets,"

The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \r\n4) Training:  All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training program for initial employment and refresher training.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted annually to comply with North Dakota State regulations.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \r\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Am"

The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\r\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.  The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable in the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Corrective actions required as a result of each compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.    \r\n7) Incident Investigation:  Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia.  The investigation will be performed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\r\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.
