(MarkWest) - Boldman facility located in Pikeville, Kentucky is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Pike County, Kentucky Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPCs) which provide emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction.  NGL is the one substance present at the facility that is regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  The flammable substance is a mixture comprised of propane, butane, isobutene, and natural gasoline (mostly pentanes and hexanes). \r\n\r\nThe NGL is extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the NGL is stored in two 60,000 gallon capacity pressure vessels (T-801 & T-802).  The Y-grade is then transferred offsite via tank truck.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 80% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filed to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessel and lead to a release.\r\n\r\n3.\tT"

The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative-case radius of impact were determined using the EPA RMP-COMP model.  Populations within that radius were determined using the Circular Area Profiling System (CAPS), Version 10c using data from Summary File 1, 2010 Census and by inputing the coordinate points and the radius of influence.  \r\n\r\n4.\tThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \r\n\tSteps\r\n\r\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations.  The propane, normal butane, isobutane, natural gasoline, and NGL storage and distribution processes at MarkWest are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\r\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The What If? methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular i"

Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\r\n\r\nA written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of regulated substances is retained at the MarkWest facility.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nThe Pike County, Kentucky LEPC is the local emergency response agencies with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will continue to monitor the implementation of the RMP program at the Boldman facility to ensure that accidental release of flammable materials does not occur.  In the past gas detectors (2001) and a process area flame detection system (2006) were implemented as a result of safety reviews to mitigate the potential hazards from the facility.\r\n\r\n8.\tConclusion\r\n\r\nMarkWest Hydrocarbon, L.L.C. has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest - Boldman facility.  The Risk Management Plan provided herein summarizes the active release prevention program that is currently in place at the facility.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest's emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Pike County, Kentucky LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigate"
