THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 112000 POUNDS WHICH REPESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 95 PERCENT CAPICITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 2.51 MILES. \n\n      B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENIARO FOR ANHYDEROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD REVIEW IS A 2 MINUTERELEASE FROMA BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE END POINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.56 MILES.\n\n   4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n       THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED  THE PROVISIONS OF \" SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA,K-61\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC.
