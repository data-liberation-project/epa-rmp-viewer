This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with off-site emergency response support.\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently, Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for cold storage and distribution operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Koch Foods is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s)have been completed and are discussed in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit.  To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP COMP was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are on file in the RMP Plan at the Koch Foods Facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the scenarios were determined through the use of Microsoft mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2010 data. \n\n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nKoch Foods"

Koch Foods is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312.\n\n\n\n- Emergency Action Plan\n\n\n\nKoch Foods current Emergency Action/Response Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency response agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public.  The plan allows Koch Foods personnel trained in emergency response operations to respond in a limited capacity to an upset or release. All other releases would be handled by local responders.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nKoch Food's aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible."
