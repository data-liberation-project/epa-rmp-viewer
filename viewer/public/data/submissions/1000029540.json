This commitment extends to the processes covered by the requirements of EPAA?s Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Florence, Alabama facility of Sara Lee Corporation (Sara Lee Florence) has developed management systems to prevent the release of regulated substances, especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. These management systems comply with the various applicable governmental regulations. The systems were developed through systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nSara Lee Florence has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nSara Lee Florence plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, management systems at the Florence facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  \n\n2   Background Data\n\nSara Lee Florence manufactures pork sausage and a variety of other meat products marketed under familiar brand names such as Jimmy Dean, Bryan and State Fair.  Raw pork is received from offsite slaughterhouses, cooked and packaged"

The site is located on about seventeen acres within the Florence City limits.  There are about 300,000 square feet under roof.  This facility has been in operation for over 50 years and currently provides more than 1000 jobs to the local community.\n\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 68 (40 CFR 68) promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Sara Lee Florence (SLF) submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Florence, Alabama facility.\n\n3   Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSLF is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment. Therefore, it is SLFA?s policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHAA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \n\n4    Stationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Florence facility operates one process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  That process is the plant-wide ammonia refrigeration process. Low temperatures are required in the food processing areas of the plant within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  These low temperatures ensure quality in the final products.  Anhydrous ammonia, an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants, is utilized as refrigerant to maintain the food processing areas of the facility within the required range of operating temperatures. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the RMP regulated chemical. The refrigeration system, consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, recirculators, and piping, can contain quan"

This process is a Program 3 process as defined by the risk management program rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n5   Release Scenarios\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, SLF evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst-case scenario and an alternate-case scenario were developed.\n\n6   Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, SLF has implemented precautionary measures. These precautionary measures comply with OSHAA?s PSM regulations and were evaluated and engineered for potential anhydrous ammonia releases.   Examples of some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, manual and automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, SLF has trained approximately 35 employees to respond to potential ammonia releases.  These trained employees comprise the facilityA?s Process Safety Team.\n\nSLF has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures incorporate safety measures.  Safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed annually by a highly qualified SOP review team. \n\nSLF encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of monthly Process Safety Team meetings.  Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees following written management of change procedures established by SLF.\n\nSLF understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases. Therefore, SLF has implemented a preventative maintenance program.  The preventative maintenance program is managed and documented to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  "

In accordance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program, SLF conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every   three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures. hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n    A? The following audits by outside agencies are conducted:\n              - The local fire department audits SLF on an annual basis.\n              - The USDA on a daily basis audits SLF.\n              - The facilityA?s insurance carrier conducts independent audits on a semi-annual basis.\n\n7   Five-year Accident History\n\nSara Lee Florence has an outstanding record of accident prevention. This good record is demonstrated by the fact that over the past five years there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n8   Emergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee Florence maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program to protect plant workers, the general public and the environment.

In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance; inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination consists of periodic meetings of the committee. The committee is comprised of emergency response officials from the public sector, local government officials, and industry representatives.  SLF has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification in event of an incident as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\nSLFA?s emergency response program is contained in a written plan.
