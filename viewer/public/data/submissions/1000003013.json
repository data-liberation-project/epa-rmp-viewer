Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe SHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant\nemployees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers\nof major public receptors inside a one (1) mile radius are provided in\nthe plan.  The CFWWD will work closely with the Emergency Management\nOffice and document coordination activities and communications.\n\n\n6    ON-GOING AND UP-COMING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTo improve the safety of regulated facilities at the VCWWTP, the\nfollowing plant expansion, process modification and facility upgrade\nprojects are under construction or are schedule"
