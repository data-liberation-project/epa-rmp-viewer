The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling capabilities for storage of the cheese. We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility. We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure. We have a preventative maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond to system upsets.\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility.\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\nEmployee Participation Program\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining Program\nContractor Safety Program\nPre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\nMechanical Integrity Program\nHot Work Permit Procedures\nManagement of Change Procedures"

Five Year Accident History\nNo ammonia-related accidents have occurred at the facility over the past five years that resulted in significant onsite or offsite consequences.\n\nE. Description of the Emergency Response Program\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials.\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThrough our Process Safety Management Program, we systematically look for possible system changes to improve the safety in our facility. As changes are made safety issues and improvements are identified and corrected."
