The regulated substance is ammonia.  \n\n(c) Fulton Market has implemented a Process Safety Management Program under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119.  The objective of this program is to significantly reduce the possibility of an uncontrolled release of ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.  The elements of this program also correspond with all standards set forth in OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and EPA 40 CFR 38 Subpart D, and include consistent, proactive measures toward maintaining the integrity and safe operation of the system.  \n\n(d) There have been no accidents, as defined by the regulations, within the previous five years.  \n\n(e) We have an on-going program to perform all necessary actions and maintenance on the system to prevent, as best as possible, a release from occurring.  As part of our program we rely upon the proper federal, state and municipal authorities to assist in the response to any release of hazardous or extremely hazardous materials from the site.  \n\n(f) The management conti"
