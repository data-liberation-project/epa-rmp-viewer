      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nNew Orleans Cold Storage West Gulf, Inc. (NOCS West Gulf, Inc.) has developed this plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazordous Chemicals and EPA'S 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe stationary source is defined as the NOCS West Gulf, Inc. facility located at 9223 Hwy 225, LaPorte, Texas. The facility is equipped with a refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system is approximately 37,595 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls inlcude automated system shutdown when safeparameters are exceeded. Adminsitrative controls involve manual isolation and shudown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure releif valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe facility has experienced no releases in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Action Plan\nAll employees are trained in the emergency action plan annually. Employees are trained to act based on their pre-assigned roles during emergency situations.  The facility is part of the Harris Count LEPC and emergencies are responded to by the local hazmat aurthorities.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\nOngoing training of operators, inspection and testing of equipment and preventative maintenance of detoriated system components are being implemented to improve safety."
