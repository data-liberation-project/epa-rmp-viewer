Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1.1  Introduction\n\n\n\nThe City of Thomson has completed a Risk Management Plan\n\nconsistent with Section 112 (r)(7) of the Clean Air Act and Part\n\n68 of Volume 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  These\n\nprocedures seek to provide for employee safety, public health, and\n\nresponse agency interaction with respect to the disinfection\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n1.1.1     Regulations and Threshold Quantities\n\nIn June 1996, Section 112(r) was promulgated by United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) dealing with chemical risk\n\nmanagement and risk reduction.  From this rule, all facilities\n\nwith a quantity of a regulated substance greater than the\n\nthreshold quantity for that substance in a process must comply\n\nwith Section 112(r).  One of these chemicals is chlorine.\n\nChlorine amounts that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity of\n\n2,500 pounds (found in 40 CFR 68.130) are regulated under Section\n\n112(r).\n\n\n\n1.1.2     Water Treatment Facilities\n\nThe City of Thomson/McDuffie County owns and operates two water\n\ntreatment facilities - Big Creek Water Plant and Augusta Road\n\nWater Plant.  The Big Creek Water Plant withdraws raw water from\n\nJ. Strom Thurmond Lake. The Augusta Road Water Plant withdraws\n\nwater from Usry's Pond.   Finished water from the plants are\n\ndisinfected with chlorine and distributed to residents and\n\nnumerous industries in the City of Thomson and McDuffie County.\n\nThe chlorination process equipment at each plant includes one-ton\n\nchlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, electrical equipment,\n\nand a chlorine gas detection system.\n\n\n\n1.2  Worst Case and Alternative Release Modeling\n\n\n\nModeling was performed using RMP*Comp for both the worst case and\n\nalternative scenario to determine the potential consequences\n\nassociated with an accidental chlorine gas release.  For each\n\nplant, atmospheric dispersion modeling was used to determine the\n\ndistance traveled by the chlorine gas before its concentration\n\ndecreases to a the"

      "SummaryText": "oretical \"toxic endpoint\".\n\n\n\n1.2.1     Worst Case Release Results\n\nThe worst case scenario, defined by USEPA, states that \".the owner\n\nor operator shall assume that the.maximum quantity in the largest\n\nvessel.is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  For each facility,\n\nthe worst case scenario involves failure of a one-ton cylinder\n\nyielding a cumulative release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a\n\nduration of ten minutes.  The distance to \"toxic endpoint\" was 1.3\n\nmiles for both plants.\n\n\n\n1.2.2     Alternative Release Results\n\nThe alternative (more likely) scenario involves mechanical failure\n\nof one flexible manifold connections (pigtail) allowing an\n\nunnoticed release to occur through this hole for one hour.  The\n\ndistance to \"toxic endpoint\" under this alternative was 0.1 miles\n\nfor both plants.  In support of the probability that a worst case\n\nscenario is not likely to occur, a review of process history\n\nindicates that no reportable accidental releases (greater than ten\n\npounds) has occurred in the past five years at the Big Creek or\n\nAugusta Road plants.\n\n\n\n1.2.3     Impacts to Population and the Environment\n\nAs part of these modeling scenarios, population and environmental\n\nsites are indexed within the radii associated with the worst and\n\nalternative release scenarios.  While the Augusta Road plant lies\n\nin an urban environment, affecting mostly residential receptors,\n\nthe Big Creek plant is predominantly rural, mostly affecting\n\nwildlife and recreational users.\n\n\n\n1.2.4     Accident History\n\nNo reportable accidental releases have occurred at the Big Creek\n\nor Augusta Road plants in the last five years.\n\n\n\n1.3  Risk Management Plan Elements\n\n\n\nThe following key elements are included in the City of Thomson's\n\nRMP:\n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\nPreventative Maintenance Program\n\nChlorine Gas Detection Equipment\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nHazard Review of Equipment and Operating Procedures\n\nCompliance Auditing\n\n\n\n1.3.1     Chlorine Safety Equipment\n\nBoth the Big Cree"

Some of that equipment includes\n\nrespiratory protection (SCBA), chlorine gas detectors, chemical\n\nright-to-know (material safety data sheets - MSDS), and personal\n\nprotective equipment (safety glasses, rubber apron/gloves, etc.).\n\n\n\n1.3.2     Coordination with  Emergency Management Agency\n\nThe Big Creek and Augusta Road plants have an emergency response\n\nplan coordinated in conjunction with the Thomson Fire Department\n\nand McDuffie County Emergency Management Agency (EMA).
