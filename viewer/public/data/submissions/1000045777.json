This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, including training of personnel and safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the processes at the Wynnewood Refinery (Wynnewood). Wynnewood implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Wynnewood places emphasis on prevention, prompt detection, and expeditious correction of unsafe conditions by periodically conducting internal inspection and regularly training responsible personnel. Should a release occur, the refinery's trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\n2 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nWynnewood operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from crude oil, such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, hydrocarbon solvents, liquefied petroleum gases and asphalts. The refinery has a threshold quantity of several flammable substances and one toxic substance (hydrogen fluoride). Regulated flammable substances at the refinery include butane, isobutane, isopentane, propane, propylene, and flammable mixtures of various regulated flammable substances. The refinery includes a total of eleven (11) RMP-covered processes. The refinery is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. Ten (10) processes are subject to Program 3 and one (1) process is subject to Program 1 requirements per the U.S. EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\n3 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWynnewood has implemented an accidental release prevention program.

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS).\n\n\n\nWynnewood also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment at the refinery. This information includes, but is not limited to, materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and refinery changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe refinery has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that  adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nWynnewood primarily uses the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist techniques to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of refinery personnel who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise, and may include third parties. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are needed. Any identified risks are promptly addressed. Resolution of each finding is documented and records of the analyses are retained.\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process"
