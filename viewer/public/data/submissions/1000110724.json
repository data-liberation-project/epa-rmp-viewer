This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of occupational and process safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Tioga Gas Plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n-   A commitment to OSHA's Process Safety Management and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, and the Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Transportation Act regulations, which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n-   Development and use of Hess Corporation and Tioga Gas Plant safety, operating, \nmaintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n-   Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized and generally accepted good \nengineering practices  (RAGAGEP), specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of facilities containing hazardous materials.\n- A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Tioga Gas Plant, located at 10340 68th Street NW, Williams County, North Dakota processes raw natural gas from area sweet oil/gas wells to produce Ethane, Propane, Butane, Natural Gasoline, and clean Natural Gas for industrial and residential use. The plant also has a capability to yield a mixed Natural Gas Liquids (Y-grade) product. The plant has several regulated flammables"

The High Pressure Inlet Receiving and Condensate process can contain H2S at level below the threshold quantity.  In addition, other processes within the plant produce and contain as by-products, Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide at levels below the listed RMP threshold quantities.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nProcesses at the Tioga Gas Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation 1910.119. The Tioga Gas Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nWithin the past five years, the Tioga Gas Plant has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1). Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables or toxics that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, public evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\nThe Tioga Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved. The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. The emergency response program includes elements required to be within the facility response plan for the a"

These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, incident investigations, compliance audits and a review of the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity programs."
