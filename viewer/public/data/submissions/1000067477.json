      "SummaryText": "Horizon Stevedoring operates a cold storage warehsouse at Pier 82 South, Philadelphia, PA. AT this facility, we store fruit transported in by ship.\n\n\n\nLike most cold storage warehouses, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system.  Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is consedered a hazardous material.  \n\n\n\nHorizon is committed to maintaining a safe warehousing operation for our employees and the surrounding community.  Out refrigeration system obeys our loal building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and stadards where applicable.  Finally, to comply with the requirements of OSHA and the EPA, we have a Process Safety Management program to hop us operate and maintain the system safely.\n\n\n\nOur priority is to prenent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our Process Safety Management porgram includes elements addressing:\n\nEmployee participation.  We involve our employees at all appropriate points in the program.\n\nProcess Safety information.  We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the desing limits of the regrigeration system so that our employees are fully informed.\n\nPrecess Hazards Analysis.  We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to important hazards and safeguards.\n\nOperating Procedures.  WE provide written operating procedures to help staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\nMechanical Integrity WE have established a comprehensive program of inspcetions and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\nTraining. WE train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenacne of the refrigeration system.\n\nManagement of Change.  Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\nPre-Startup Safey Review. For certain types of major changes, we conduct a "

We caefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n\nWe stricly control the welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n\nEmergency Response. WE coordinate our resonse to emergencies wht the Phladelphia Fire Deparment.\n\nIncident Investigation.  After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n\nCompliance Audits.  Approximately every three (3) years we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n\nTrade Secrets.  OSHA and EPA require us to maintain a trade secrets progam in case confidential information affecting the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system is found.\n\nManagement System.  An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\n\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" hypothetical ammonia release scenarios and their consequences, details of which appear in other portions of the Risk Management Plan.  The methodology used to evauate these accidents is prescribed by regulation, and makes no effort to estimate the likelihoo or \"risk\" of these incidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to improve the safety of the refrigeration system."
