Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nAs stated in our Worldwide Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc., is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence. To accomplish this we integrated health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities. This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc., Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective. This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations. This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, and hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine). The site includes four (4) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities, three (3) resin reactors, and one (1) hexamine manufacturing facility. Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for both types of resins and hexamine. Anhydrous ammonia is a raw material used for hexamine, and is received in railcars. Aqua ammonia is used in small amounts as a raw material for both types of resins. It is received in tank trucks and reusable tote bins.\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThis plant has a Process Safety Management Program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process S"

This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly safety committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule. The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for this program.\n\n?Process stewards? are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units. Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit. All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nEach Process Steward maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains, their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action item database to track the items to completion.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents. For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review. This review may include a process hazard analysis. Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, and the plant manager. Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact. Pre-Start-Up Safety Revi"

      "SummaryText": "ews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change has been made.\n\nA preventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment. A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases. One important section describes safety measures for welding or other ?hot? work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could cause a release are investigated and recommendations may lead to improvements are made to prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nPeriodically, a safety professional from another Hexion Specialty Chemicals location conducts a comprehensive audit of the safety program. Addressing recommendations from this audit keeps the safety program effective.\n \n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nIn the five (5) year period from May 1, 1999 to May 1, 2004, there were no offsite releases of a regulated substance exceeding reported requirements. \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe plant maintains a corps of emergency responders who can take prompt action if an accidental release occurs. This includes containment of spills and other releas"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following work is planned to reduce the potential of a runaway reaction on the phenol formaldehyde resin process.  The planned project includes equipment and process control upgrades to cooling capacity, deluge capacity, and interlock/alarm functions.\n\nThe following work is planned to reduce a potential release at the formaldehyde process units.  The planned project includes equipment and process control upgrades on pumps agitators and interlock/alarm functions."
