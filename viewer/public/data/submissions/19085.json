We will strive to comply with legislative \n    requirements and eliminate any foreseeable hazards which may result in losses, damage to\n    property, personnel injury and illnesses, and the environment.\n    \n    The Accidental Release Prevention Policy at the facility is embedded in our overall\n    approach to planning, design and construction intended to minimize hazards; and the\n    training of all personnel in proper operation, maintenance and inspection procedures with\n    emphasis on awareness and practices to minimize hazards and avoid accidents.  The\n    Emergency Response Policy is to identify potential hazards at the facility, and develop and\n    implement a plan to respond to emergency events including, but not limited to fire,\n    accidents or injury.  The Emergency Response Plan includes identification of responders\n    and their duties, and procedures for notification of responders including fire department,\n    evacuation, shutdown, communications, and medical response.\n\n2)  Stationary Source:\n  \n      The purpose of the Heath Compressor facility is to withdraw field gas from a nearby\n       production well gathering system, remove hydrocarbon liquid and moisture from the gas,\n       raise the pressure of the gas, and deliver it into a natural gas transmission piping system.\n      The operation is carrie"

The process that is\n      covered by this Risk Management Program (RMP) is a secondary function at the facility. \n      This is a process for storage of water and hydrocarbon liquids (liquid product) which are\n       stripped from the natural gas, and stored in either an 8,000 gallon or a 4,000 gallon holding\n       tank until it is shipped weekly, via tanker truck. The other process, which is the primary\n       process at this facility, is a natural gas compression process which is not covered by this\n       RMP.\n    \n       In this other process natural gas is withdrawn from the gathering system, compressed and\n       delivered to a high pressure transmission system.  The natural gas is compressed in three\n       stages, and it is cooled between stages and after the final stage.  Liquids that are formed\n       due to compression and cooling are temporarily stored in drip pots.  During each shift\n       operators manually open valves for a few minutes to drain the pots and blow the liquid\n       product into the storage system.\n    \n      The natural gas is also passed through a glycol dehydration system for further drying. \n      The liquids generated in the dehydration system are temporally accumulated and then\n      automatically dumped into the storage process.\n      \n      The storage system is set up to primarily hold the liquid product in the 8,000 gallon\n      tank. The 4,000 gallon tank is used instead of the 8,000 gallon tank during winter\n      periods to avoid water freeze ups.  The 4,000 gallon tank is heated with a closed glycol\n      loop from the dehydration system. \n3)   Regulated Substances:\n  \n    The liquid product is a flammable liquid, and consists of an approximate a mixture of:\n    \n          i)    Water\n          ii)   Butane\n          iii)  Iso-Butane\n          iv)  Pentane\n           v)  Other organics\n\n    Since the analytical composition of this liquid product varies depending on the "
