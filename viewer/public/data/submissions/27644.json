The Apex Generating Station also uses chemicals as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating Apex Generating Station, Mirant Las Vegas, LLC takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) Program under Nevada Administrative Code 459.952.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  Apex Generating Station has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs one of the world?s leading competitive energy providers, Mirant generates the energy that creates opportunity --- improving the quality of life and supporting economic development in the communities we serve around the world.

At Mirant, we incorporate safety and health practices into our business every day. \n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Apex Generating Station is located at 15555 Apex Power Parkway in North Las Vegas, Nevada,  approximately one mile west of U.S. Hwy 93 and approximately 3.4 miles northwest of the intersection of Highway 93 and Interstate 15. The site is located in Clark County about 20 miles northeast of Las Vegas.  Mirant Las Vegas, LLC, owns the 90-acre site which is within Section 5, Township 18 South, Range 63 East.  Except for the construction of a power plant on adjacent property to the south, the site is surrounded by undeveloped industrial zoned properties.  Federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management are present to the west of the property boundary.  Further west of the federal lands is the Desert National Wildlife Range. The facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CAPP regulations, in a steel bulk storage tank.  \n\nAmmonia is used at the Apex Generating Station to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and two HRSG duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two SCR units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,228-gallon capacity storage tank.  Because the storage tank is restricted from being filled to more than 80 percent, the maximum inventory of the anhydrous ammonia at the Apex Generating Station is 12,182 gallons or approximately 62,130 pounds.  The safety systems for the ammonia process include the following:\n\nExcess flow valves.  Excess flow check valves protect against tank failure by shutting off flow in the event of a do"

Four permanently mounted ammonia detectors are located at the ammonia storage tank and both flow control skids have a permanently mounted ammonia detector and local alarm horn. The detectors will activate a local alarm horn and an audible and visual signal on the fire alarm panel in the Control Room.  The fire alarm panel sends a signal to the local fire department.\n\nFirewater System.  The site has a full service Fire Protection System.  The function of the system is to detect and suppress fires or potential fires and annunciate each occurrence\n\nAudible and Visual Alarms ? Evacuation Signal: If evacuation of the plant is necessary, the construction contractor will sound an alarm consisting of three (3) long siren wails.  (Applies to construction period only.) Ammonia Release Alarm:  Ammonia leak detectors located at the storage tank and flow control skids sound a local alarm and an alarm in the Control Room when ammonia is detected in the air at a concentration of 25 PPM  or above.  The local ammonia alarm consists of a steady siren sound. Fire Alarm:  Smoke detectors and pull stations are located through the occupied buildings at the Apex Generating Station that activate the fire alarm.  The alarm consists of a high-pitched beep and strobe light.  The alarm sounds only in the building(s) where the smoke detector or pull station were activated.\n\nPublic Address System.  A public address system will be installed prior to the completion of construction.  It will be capable of transmitting voice announcements to speakers located at strategic locations throughout the plant, as well as each telephone connected to the communication network.

The spray system will provide a means of controlling and mitigating unauthorized discharges, and it will also provide an emergency means of cooling the tank in the event it is exposed to fire.   \n\nPressure Relief Valves. The anhydrous ammonia process incorporates four (4) pressure relief valves.  They include two (2) 100% capacity relief valves on the tank, one (1) relief valve on the tank level gage, and one (1) relief valve on the liquid in piping.\n\nContainment Area. The storage tank and unloading area are both situated inside a secondary containment that consists of a drive and concrete pad that slopes into a covered sump. The sump capacity will be 18,233 gallons.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as ?worst case? and ?alternative? release scenarios.  The worst-case release scenario requires that a release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts.  Only passive or administrative controls can be considered under the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario for Apex Generating Station is the rupture of the ammonia storage tank, resulting in a release of 62,130 pounds of ammonia over a 10-minute duration.  In practice, this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant. \n\nThe released liquid is assumed to quickly volatilize and disperse as a vapor cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the Areal Location of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 200 ppm. All required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity,"

Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (116 degrees F), and average humidity (30 percent).  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that this scenario has an impact to receptors offsite.  The offsite impacts have been reduced by limiting the filling of the storage tank to 80 percent of the tank capacity.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for each regulated substance is also required.  The alternative release scenario is a release scenario more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Unlike the worst-case release scenario, active controls can be considered in analyzing the impacts of an alternative release scenario.  Active controls consist of mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The alternative release scenarios used for ammonia was a small leak in the process piping (flange).  The active mitigation provided by leak detectors was considered. The same modeling approach used was similar to the worst-case release scenario, except meteorological conditions were adjusted to more common conditions of Stability D Class, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 67 degrees F, and average humidity of 30 percent.\n\nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a much smaller offsite impact.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nApex Generating Station is in compliance with Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.
