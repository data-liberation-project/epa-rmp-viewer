However, should a release occur, plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\nThe Roystone gas processing  plant is located approximately 3.8 miles northeast of Sheffield, PA on state highway 6.  The plant processes about 6 MMSCFD of natural gas and provides both a service and a product.  The gas is dehydrated and hydrocarbons, which might otherwise condense in the transmission pipeline and cause problems, are removed, thus producing a saleable gas product.  The hydrocarbons that are recovered are fractionated into propane, butane and natural gasoline products.  Total liquid production is approximately 350 BPD with total propane and butane storage capacity of 2,500 Bbls.  The plant has inlet compression, dehydration and utilizes a refrigerated JT process for hydrocarbon recovery.  The plant contains several regulated flammables such as propane and butane.  No threshold quantity of a regulated toxic is present at the plant site.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results:\nThe WCS is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full capacity of the largest propane storage tank, 123,000 Lbs.  Although a written procedure is in place to limit the inventory to 90% of capacity, the entire tank capacity was used in this scenario.  EPA's RMP*COMP software was used to determine that the maximum distance to a 1 psi endpoint was 0.4 miles.  \n\nThe ARS is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a truck loading line (16,400 Lbs released in 10 min.).  The release is expected to be blocked in by the operator within 10 minutes.  Again the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used and the distance to a 1 psi endpoint is"

Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements of the PSM program and the employees are well trained in the safe operation of this facility.  \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \nThe Roystone plant includes the following safety features:\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2. Process safety relief valves.\n3. Automated plant shutdown system.  The plant will be automatically shutdown should key process parameters vary from specified ranges. \n4. Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process.\n5. Diking  to contain liquid releases.\n6. Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe Roystone plant was placed in operation in May of 1995.  The plant has had no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\nThe Roystone plant Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the Warren County Control Office.  The plan has been posted at the plant and all employees have been trained in the actions to be taken in event of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nNo changes to the safety program or plant facilities are currently planned.  However, weekly safety meetings are held during which incidents are reviewed, safety procedures discussed and changes proposed.  Our safety program is constantly improving."
