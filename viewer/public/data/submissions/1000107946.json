Working alongside our clients AFCO delivers expertise and hands-on support to help meet sanitation, compliance and operational needs efficiently and cost-effectively.\r\n\r\nThe 55,000 square foot Chambersburg facility serves as a site for the manufacture of cleaning, sanitation and maintenance products.  Many of these products are manufactured under strict quality control procedures since these products are utilized in industries making consumer products, food and beverages.  AFCO provides a full range of services connected with our products, including consultation, training, equipment designed to deliver our products, and customer site service. \r\n\r\nThe peracetic acid products which are produced on site are packaged in various containers, including 330-gallon totes, 55 gallon drums, and smaller (1-5 gallon) containers.  The warehouse section of the facility stores and ships these products to customers.  Peracetic acid manufacturing and product packaging are conducted in a 2,000 square foot room in the facility that can be isolated from the general plant manufacturing and warehousing facilities.  \r\n\r\nAFCO implements an accidental release prevention policy to ensure compliance with the EPA RMP regulation.  The accidental release prevention program includes:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information, which includes:\r\no\tSDS sheets for products containing peracetic acid, \r\no\tsafety information for the peracetic acid system and process chemistry; \r\no\tinventory which is an ongoing update of quantities products containing peracetic acid on hand; \r\no\tpiping and instrumentation diagrams"

The plan details the actions plant employees would take in the event of a release of peracetic acid, incidents involving other substances, fires, and health emergencies.  The plan details the means to notify all workers of incidents and actions to be taken, such as site evacuation and headcount; and includes contact information for local emergency response organizations, including the Franklin County Fire and EMS. Evacuation plans are available and evacuation escape plan maps can be found throughout the facility.  The site maintains inventories of emergency equipment and supplies on site.  The response plan has been reviewed with the local emergency response organizations and the Franklin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety - AFCO is currently working on several projects to improve site safety.
