      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Hambert Compressor Station (Station). This station is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard. However, APC has decided proactively to apply the standard to the station to provide a higher standard of safety.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station is located in Weld County near the intersection of Weld County Road 38 and Weld County Road 35 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  \n\nThe Station consists of two compressor units, #51 and #52, that discharge 18 MMCF/D through glycol dehydration to delivery points via 20\u00bf pipelines. The discharge pressure is not to exceed 1,220 psig. The station is equipped with inlet separation. Liquids separated (condensate) are injected into the stations discharge. \n\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission. Compressor receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moistu"

      "SummaryText": "re (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that should be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nThe Station\u00bfs maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances.  Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1970's.  The compressor station was sold to Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in 1993 and who maintained operations through December 1, 1999.  In 1999 HS Resources bought the station and operated it until 2001. In August, 2001 Kerr McGee (KMG) acquired HS Resources and continued operations until APC acquired Kerr McGee in 2006.\n\nProgram Level\n\nAPC has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Hambert Compressor Station for the following reasons:\n\n1 The station has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local fire department;\n2 The station has not had a accidental release of the regulated substances (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused death, injury, or response/restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years; and\n3 The distance to any \u00bfreceptor\u00bf is greater than then calculated endpoint for the worse-case scenario of 0.3 miles. \n4 No personnel are stationed at the site, operational checks only.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\nAccide"
