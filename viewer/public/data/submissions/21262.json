It was built and maintained by certified workmen specializing in Ammonia facilities.  We have never had an accident or accidental release of Ammonia causing injury or property damage since built.  The tanks consisting of one 12,000 gallon and two 6,000 gallon tanks are located on a farmstead one mile east of the town of Ackley, Iowa. Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our storage tanks.  The EPA worst case endpoint would include the town of Ackley (pop. 1800), alternative would include 350 people.  We conduct yearly safety training for our employees and customers utilizing guidelines, a video cassette program, and training manual provided by Agricom Inc., an Iowa fertilizer consulting firm.  In the event of an emergency, we would call 911 to get immediate contact with the Ackley Fire Dept.  We are not planning any changes in our safety program.   Sincerely, Merle W. Hunt, Owner"
