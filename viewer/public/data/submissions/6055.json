      "SummaryText": "The Town of Guilderland operates a water treatment facility which uses chlorine as a water disinfectant.  The maximum quantity contained on site at one time is about 4,000 pounds of liquified gaseous chlorine.  There are two containers each with a capacity of 2,000 lbs.  One is in use and the other in storage.  The threat of a release is most probable during transfer.  Other incidents could occur due to faulty piping or fittings.  There has no been a significant release during the past five years.  A chlorine saftey program has been formulated at the facility and the local emergency response units are aware of the potential of a chloring leak into the atmosphere.   The chemical is stored in an enclosed building and there are leal monitors and detectors."
