Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario is a simulated rupture of the supply hose at the loading docks resulting in a release of propane and simulated vapor cloud explosion.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.   This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at the design flow rate following the hose rupture and the automatic high flow shutdown failed to activate . Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility after an estimated maximum release time of two minutes.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.
