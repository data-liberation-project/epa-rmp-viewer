Box 399\nLockport, LA 70374\n\n\nRisk Management Plan\n2004 Update\n\n\nExecutive Summary:  North Treatment Plant\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your site\n\nDue to new regulations under the Chemical Accident Prevention Program, the District has developed a Risk Management Plan for chlorine gas.  The requirements involve instituting a prevention plan to avoid unnecessary chlorine leaks in addition to revising its existing emergency response procedure.  The expectations of the above mentioned requirements are to allow minimal injury and damage to occur, as well as to provide aid and guidance for other responders in the event of an accident.\n\nThe prevention plan, developed by the District, has been designed to ensure that all precautions are taken so as to prevent and mitigate any possible chlorine release.  One element of this plan is to assess the chlorine process for potential hazards that could contribute to a leak then correct the problems immediately.  Another essential component is written operating procedures for all duties associated with chlorine, while another is to provide proper training to employees involved in those duties.  From now on, all training and inspection information will be documented for future reference.\n\nThe revised emergency response plan has been implemented with the intention that plant personnel will respond, contain and repair all chlorine leaks.  One reason for this is because we feel our employees are properly trained and experienced enough to resolve the problem in a timely manner.  Another reason is because plant policy allows chlorine cylinders to be handled only during normal working hours. Consequently most releases will occur at this time while enough qualified people are present to initiate a response.  Nonetheless, it is possible to have a release after hours, but because two people are on site at all times they will be able mitigate the situation."

The physical address is 1052 Highway 1, Thibodaux. \n\n2.\tBackground Information:\t\nThe Lafourche Parish Water District No. 1- North Treatment Plant is a potable drinking water production facility.  The District purifies water taken from Bayou Lafourche and distributes the water to customers throughout Lafourche Parish.\nChlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in the treatment process and is fed continuously.  The District has one (1) ton chlorine cylinders on site.  Plant personnel remove the one (1) ton cylinders when empty and replace them with full cylinders.  This involves transporting cylinders with a forklift, lifting the cylinders with a hoist, and mounting a regulator onto the cylinder valve.  These chlorine cylinders are only replaced during normal working hours due to safety concerns.      \nDistrict personnel can deal with most emergency response and repair situations; nonetheless, outside assistance may be necessary depending on the severity of the leak.  \u00bfB\u00bf repair kits, self-contained breathing apparatuses, and extra air bottles are stored in an emergency response and repair cart, which is available for quick response.  Containment suits and gloves can also be found in the cart.   \nSugarcane surrounds the plant on two sides with LA Highway 1 and the Country Club Subdivision on the other two.  The closest residence is located approximately 600 feet north of the plant.\n\n\n\n \nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n1.\tGeneral:\nThe following information represents general prevention program policies to prohibit unnecessary chlorine leaks.\n1)\tSafety information documented and distributed to employees\n2)\tProperly designed chlorination equipment\n3)\tHazard review conducted\n4)\tWritten operati"

The details of both are provided in the \u00bfChlorine - Emergency Response\u00bf SOP (attachment 6.74).

This situation may or may not require the emergency response cart, but it will be prepared for use regardless.  The purpose of the Code Yellow response is to attempt to diagnose the problem and/or rectify the situation by closing valves.\nThe code red response will be utilized when a leak is known to be greater than 10 pounds and/or the repair kit is needed to correct the situation.\nA personal protective equipment SOP is provided in RMP.  \n\t\n\nAfter Hours:\nPurification department day workers normal working hours are 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday; otherwise, there are two people operating the plant at all times.  Plant policy allows handling of chlorine cylinders only during normal working hours in order that sufficient workers are present in case an emergency response is initiated.  If an emergency situation arises after hours, the man on standby and any other supervisor available shall be contacted and notified of the situation.

If shelter-in-place is initiated, all air conditioning must be shut off, and all vents, windows, and doors closed.  In addition, office personnel shall keep customers from leaving during this time.  Office personnel should listen for further advisories.\nOffice personnel will be prepared to evacuate the premises on short notice.

Evacuation or shelter-in-place of residences will be at the discretion of the Law Enforcement Agencies. These agencies may choose to shelter residences within \u00bd mile of the plant.
