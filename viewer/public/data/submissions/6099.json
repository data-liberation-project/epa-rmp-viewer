Effective maintenance\n     procedures are integral to preventing chemical releases that may\n     result from mechanical failure of improperly maintained\n     equipment.\n\n5    THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo accidental releases of regulated chemicals from a regulated process\nat the RHWTP has occurred in the past five years resulting in any\ndeath, injury, or property damage on site, or known offsite impacts\n(i.e., deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, or property\ndamages, or environmental damages).\n\n6    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nCFWWD personnel do not respond to uncontrolled releases of chemicals\nfrom any regulated process at the RHWTP.  Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe RHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.
