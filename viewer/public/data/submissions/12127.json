These unique mill products are used in the manufacture of electrical \nconnectors, thermostatic controls, electronic assemblies, automobiles, and a broad array of high \ntechnology products.  Started in North Attleboro in 1972 and located at 242 Broad Street since 1990, \nPolymetallurgical (PMC) currently employs 75 full-time people.  It is responsible for over $1 million per \nyear in taxes and wages paid within the town of North Attleboro and immediately adjacent communities.  \nSensitive to its location very close to residential areas and on the shore of Whiting Pond, the company has \ntaken pains to minimize noise, air emissions, and wastewater pollutants emanating from the facility.  This \nexecutive summary describes recent efforts to evaluate and to further minimize safety risks associated \nwith the use of anhydrous ammonia at 242 Broad Street.\n\n\nABOUT THE USE OF AMMONIA\n\n    In order to successfully form and shape its metallic products, PMC -- like many other companies \nin the area -- uses pure, dry (anhydrous) ammonia to create a protective atmosphere of nitrogen and \nhydrogen within special metalworking furnaces.  The ammonia is delivered to the facility by tank truck, \nroughly once every 8-12 weeks.  It is received and stored as an unrefrigerated liquid kept under pressure.\nThe ammonia storage tank is a specially designed, aboveground, steel cylinder of 8000-gallon \ncapacity.  Industry-standard procedures and special design features limit filling to 85% of the maximum \ntank capacity.  The pressure inside the tank rises in summer and falls in winter as the temperature of the \nliquid ammonia changes inside the tank.  In order to "

      "SummaryText": "ensure that the pressure inside the tank is sufficient to \ndeliver ammonia gas inside the plant, the tank is kept warm in winter by a small electric heater.\n    Ammonia gas is piped from the tank, through an emergency shut-off valve and several pressure \nregulators, to electrically heated dissociators located on the roof of the building.  There the ammonia is \n'cracked' at a pressure of 15 psig into a mixture of 3 parts hydrogen gas to 1 part nitrogen gas.  The \ncracked gas contains virtually no ammonia, and the unused hydrogen is safely burned as it escapes from \nthe entrance and exit of each metalworking furnace.\n\n\nGENERAL PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF AMMONIA\n\n    Several national standards organizations -- including the Compressed Gas Association (CGA), the \nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and the American National Standards Institute \n(ANSI) -- have long recognized the possibility of the accidental release of various fuels and chemicals \nfrom pressurized storage tanks, and they have developed detailed design requirements and operating \nguidelines to prevent such accidental releases.  The ammonia storage tank was designed and installed in \nfull compliance with these standards and guidelines, and it incorporates such safeguards as:\n* the exclusive use of heavy-gauge steel pipe for all permanent connections between the tank, the \n  building, and the truck unloading station, designed to prevent accidental breakage\n* restriction orifices and excess flow check valves on all connections to the tank, designed to minimize \n  or stop an accidental release if human error causes a pipe to be opened or disconnected at the wrong \n  time\n* hydrotesting of the tank to prove it can withstand an internal pressure far in excess of its design \n  pressure \n* relief valves, designed to spit very tiny amounts of liquid ammonia out of connecting pipes as \n  necessary to prevent a more serious and irreversible pipe break if cold liquid ammonia is trapped \n  w"

Procedures also require that a PMC employee be stationed at the ammonia storage tank during \nunloading, to make sure that the driver follows safe procedures and to monitor the level and pressure \ninside the tank.\n\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    In the nine years that Polymetallurgical has owned the current facility, and over the 27 years that \nit has operated in North Attleboro, the company has experienced no accidental releases from the ammonia \nprocess that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or offsite.  Nor have any \nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage occurred.  In 1998 there was \na very small leak of ammonia from a pipe fitting inside the building, close to the storage tank.  PMC \nnotified the fire department (NAFD) of this occurrence and had the department stand by during repair, \njust in case any emergency response was required.  The leak was repaired without incident.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n    Despite the safety provisions and perfect safety record described above, EPA regulations require \nconsideration of a theoretical worst-case release scenario -- the failure of the largest single vessel \ncontaining ammonia.  PMC's worst-case scenario is failure of the 8,000 gallon storage tank when \ncompletely full (85% capacity), such that t"

EPA's Off-\nSite Consequence Analysis Guidance suggests a very conservative (i.e. very high) estimate of the distance \nto the endpoint (i.e., the distance that the ammonia gas may travel until it dissipates to a certain, \nprescribed concentration).  The crude model offered by the agency for this purpose suggests an impact \nzone stretching 2.3 miles from the plant, potentially in any direction.  The model assumes conditions that \nmaximize the concentration of the gas and minimize natural dilution; such as assuming the entire contents \nof the gas are released within 10 minutes and that there is minimal wind or atmospheric turbulence (i.e. \n3.4 mph and F-stability).  Compared to other models, this model is known to do a inferior job of \npredicting the behavior of ammonia releases.\n    To obtain a more realistic picture of the worst-case release scenario, PMC turned to the SLAB \nmodel developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, validated against large experimental \nreleases of pressurized ammonia liquid and gas in the Nevada desert in 1986, and endorsed by the EPA as \nan acceptable model for risk management planning.  Using the same unusually low wind speed and \natmospheric stability assumptions, and given the same release rate 3500 pounds per minute (lb/min), this \nmodel predicts a distance of 1.24 miles to that same concentration endpoint.  \n    The concentration endpoint specified by the Agency is 200 ppm (parts per million by volume), \nthe maximum to which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing \nserious health effects or developing symptoms which could impair their ability to take protective action.  \nIn fact, nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour at 1000 ppm without experiencing or \ndeveloping life-threatening health effects; the maximum distance at which that high concentration could \nbe encountered is predicted by the SLAB model to be 0.33 miles.\n    Using"

Essentially, in requiring consideration of an \nalternative case, the EPA is saying, \"OK, we know that the worst-case scenario might be unimaginable, \nbut think about what could conceivably go wrong here.\"  Accordingly, PMC has imagined that the \nconnection between the ammonia tank truck and the storage tank is somehow completely broken during \nunloading, most likely by human error in making the connection.  Now both the storage tank and the tank \ntruck are equipped with excess flow check valves (EFCV), and these devices should immediately shut off \nthe release from both locations.  But for planning purposes, we assume that the break occurs in such a \nway that the EFCV on the storage tank fails to close, permitting liquid ammonia to escape at 225 gpm \nfrom the fill line that is connected to the bottom of the tank.  This release continues at ground level until \nthe tank is empty or until it has been shut off by the NAFD.  Approximately 23% of this liquid \nimmediately turns to a gas as it escapes from the tank and is no longer kept under pressure.  The \nevaporation of liquid ammonia drops the temperature of the evaporated gas and remaining liquid to -28 F, \ndisperses almost all of the remaining liquid as a fine mist, and condenses moisture in the air to form a \nthick fog.  The liquid ammonia quickly evaporates as the air and ground warm it.  And the temperature of \nthe ammonia gas rises quickly"

The options being considered include:\n1) Reducing the maximum quantity of ammonia stored in the existing equipment\n2) Replacing the existing 8000 gallon storage tank with two 1000 gallon tanks\n3) Installing an emergency water curtain system capable of absorbing most of an accidental ammonia \nrelease before the vapor could drift offsite\n4) Enclosing the storage tank and connecting that enclosure to a scrubber capable of absorbing most of \nan accidental ammonia release\n5) Refrigerating the ammonia and installing an insulated dike to hold any release as liquid, minimizing \nthe release of ammonia vapor\n6) Eliminating the use of anhydrous ammonia, and instead generating hydrogen gas on site by the \nelectrolysis of water or by reforming natural gas\n7) Eliminating the use of anhydrous ammonia, and instead supplying the hydrogen needs of the metal \ntreating furnaces from a cryogenic hydrogen tank\n\nThe first option will be pursued as quickly as possible, with the objective being to reduce and then to \nmaintain the inventory below 10,000 lb.

On the other hand, options 1 and 2 both decrease the \nimpact zone of the worst-case scenario, and option 2 would decrease the impact zone of an accidental \nconnection failure.\n\nAmmonia releases are easily and very effectively absorbed by water.  Numerous large-scale field tests \nhave demonstrated that water sprays can reduce the impact zone by 90% or more; but the quantity of \nwater required may exceed the capacity of the city water system.  Fixed scrubbers can be even more \neffective as long as the release point can be enclosed or otherwise captured into the scrubber; but \nscrubbing of a very cold, very fast release can be problematic, and capturing a release like that described \nas the 'alternate release scenario' might be difficult.  Both options 3 and 4, if ever exercised, would \ngenerate sizable wastewater streams that would be quite difficult to manage on site.\n\nOption 5, refrigeration of the stored ammonia would greatly reduce the impact zones under any scenario.  \nBut it introduces new costs and complexity to the operation.\n\nOption 6, onsite hydrogen generation is the most complex and is likely to be the most expensive.  The \ncapital investment could easily be more than $500k; operating and maintenance costs are likely to be \nhigher than those of other options.  Although hydrogen is routinely generated for other applications by the \nmethods being contemplated, the technologies are largely unproven in this application and size range.  \nThis option carries a higher technical risk of project failure, but promises near-zero inventories of \nflammable and toxic materials.\n\nThe substitution of bulk hydrogen delivery for ammonia dissociation has already been adopted by a \nnumber of other metal forming companies in the area.  It is a well-proven, commerci"

If ammonia is kept on site, and if a release \noccurs during working hours, the NAFD would be notified immediately by security, the onsite emergency \nresponse coordinator would quickly determine if evacuation of the facility was required, and personnel \nwould quickly move upwind, away from the release.  Plant maintenance staff wearing protective \nequipment maintained on site could handle small gas leaks.  Larger releases at the storage tank could be \nmitigated at present by the NAFD using fog nozzles, or in the future by other means described above.\nOutside of working hours, if an active mitigation system were installed, a significant ammonia \nrelease"

PMC has suggested that an audible alarm could be installed, promptly \nwarning residents in the immediate vicinity of the plant in the event of an ammonia release.  PMC intends \nto work with the NAFD, providing technical advice and funding for a brochure that will inform local \nresidents on the actions they should take if an ammonia release was ever to occur.\n    In sum, the emergency response plan is a multi-layer defensive strategy:\n* First, the plant is designed so that it is extraordinarily unlikely that a significant ammonia \n  release would ever occur\n* Second, as evidenced by its perfect safety record, the plant is maintained and operated in a \n  very safe manner, consistent with the underlying design\n* Third, the local fire department is trained and equipped to respond promptly and effectively \n  to any release of ammonia at the site.  Future installation of a water curtain or scrubber \n  system could provide a nearly instantaneous and even more effective response.  Other \n  measures now under consideration would diminish or eliminate the need for such active \n  mitigation measures.\n* Fourth, unless an offsite impact can be completely avoided, the appropriate local authorities  \n  will inform the public of actions that should be taken if a significant release should ever \n  occur."
