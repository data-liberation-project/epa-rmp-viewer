This facility has mechanisms in place as identified in \"Emergency Response Plan\" to address releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  If an emergency were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThis facility is a producer of sodium hypochlorite solution and temporary storer of ton containers of chlorine.  Chlorine is an intermediate product in the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite.  Sulfur dioxide is used in the manufacturing process.  The liquid chlorine system has a calculated maximum chlorine quantity on-site of 920,000 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide system has a calculated maximum sulfur dioxide quantity on-site of 10,000 pounds.  \n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst-case chlorine release scenario is the failure of a rail car when it has its maximum intended inventory of 180,000 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 0.0087 mg/l chlorine toxic endpoint is 13 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our worst-case sulfur dioxide release scenario is the failure of a ton container when it has its maximum intended inventory of 2,000 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 0.0078 mg/l sulfur dioxide toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative chlorine and sulfur dioxide release scenarios are 1/4\" effective diameter orifice leak (representative of releases from piping failures a"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 0.2 mile.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with Chlorine Institute codes and standards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have not had an accident involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or shelterings in place in the five years prior to March 28, 2006.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our chlorine systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in written plans entitled \"Emergency Response Plan\", \"Process Safety Management, Chlorine Systems\", and \"Process Safety Management, Sulfur Dioxide System\".  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Comission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems."
