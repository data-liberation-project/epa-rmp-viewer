If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Auburn, ME Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We do not have an on site fire brigade. Our on site employees are trained to fight incipient-stage fires only and then evacuate and assist the local fire department with propane technical knowledge and assistance. \n\nThis facility is a bulk terminal storing LPG primarily for distribution direct to our wholesale and retail customers via bobtail delivery. A portion of the product from this site is distributed to our network of smaller company owned terminals via transport loads. The facility consists of two 60,000 gallon tanks and is serviced by multiple 30,000 gallon railroad cars, staged on St.Lawrence Railroad property, awaiting offload.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of two 60,000 gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThis facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. \n\nWe have never had an accident at this location involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Auburn, ME Fire Department and request that they help respond to the emergency. We also have trained Propane Emergency Responders within our company that can provide technical assistance to the Incident Commander. We have coordinated our response"
