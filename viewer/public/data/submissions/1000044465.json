              "Description": "To protect public health and safety and the environment from the hazards of a catastrophic release of Chlorine, the Manchester Creek WWTP implements a procedure approved by the RMProgram to safely handle all chemicals (i.e. Chlorine) beyond the threshold quantity of 2500 pounds to prevent any type of accident, and if an accident occurs, the RMProgram is designed so all employees will be aware of the necessary procedures to contain the chemial.  This procedure includes a Process Hazard Analysis every 5 years, training for new employees and a refresher training for current employees periodically, emergency planning and response, current and up do date information on any change in management, a precise incident investigation if a leak is to occur, and abides with all compliance audits.  The purpose of implementing the RMProgram is to ensure that current written process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees, PHA teams, and auditors.",

This program requires facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\n\n\nRock Hill Utilities of Rock Hill, SC, is subject to this regulation as the owner and operator of the Manchester Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The Manchester Creek facility is located at 310 Red River Road, approximately two miles southeast of the intersection of Red River Road and U.S. Highway 21 in Rock Hill, York County, South Carolina.  This facility is a stationary source of chlorine (a regulated substance) in excess of 2,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nA RMProgram has been developed to meet the intent of the regulations for this facility using Program 3. Information from the Federal Register, AWWAs Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, and EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance For Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68) were used as resources during the development of this program.\n\n\n\nThe Manchester Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine in its wastewater treatment process to disinfect the treated wastewater before being discharged into Manchester Creek. The chlorination process includes the storage of up to nine (9) 1-ton cylinders of liquid/gaseous chlorine. The process is located within a closed building utilizing a vacuum feed system, instrumentation, process specific piping and connection materials.\n\n\n\nA hazard assessment was conducted at the facility to determine the past history of accidents or releases of chlorine. Plant records and interviews with current plant personnel indicated there have been no releases of chlorine in the last five years that resulted in injury, death or property damage"

      "SummaryText": ".  In addition, an informal survey of plant personnel and others familiar with the plants operational history did not reveal the occurrence of a significant chlorine release over the past 20-years.\n\n\n\nIn compliance with the regulations, a worst-case release scenario was modeled using the EPA RMPComp dispersion model to determine the potential impact of such a release. The worst-case scenario assumes that a one 1-ton container releases 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine over a 10-minute period. The model predicted that areas within a 1.3 mile radius of the plant could be adversely affected by such a release. This area would include public receptors such as businesses, residences, and other public institutions.\n\n\n\nAn alternative-case scenario was also modeled using RMPComp to help predict the effects of a more probable release. This scenario involved a valve failure resulting in the release of gaseous chlorine through a 5/16\" diameter opening over a 60-minute period in a closed building. This simulation results in the release of 424 pounds of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  RMPComp predicted that areas located within a 0.1 mile radius of the release point could be adversely impacted. \n\n\n\n1.2 Overview of EPA Risk Management Regulations\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program regulations are intended to help minimize the potential impacts of accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances. These regulations are applicable to the Manchester Creek WWTP because chlorine stored at the facility is in excess of the EPA RMP Threshold amount of 2,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Manchester Creek WWTP RMProgram complies with the intent of the EPA regulations by providing information to the utility employees, local emergency preparedness officials, and the affected public to minimize health and safety impacts. The program consists of:\n\n\n\na. A management plan.\n\nb. An employee participation plan.\n\nc. A hazard assessment.\n\nd. A prevention program (Program 3).\n\ne. An emergency response plan.\n\nf.

RMPlan submittal to EPA\n\n\n\nThe related Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rules (29 CFR 1910.119) require comprehensive management systems for the handling of these highly hazardous chemicals. South Carolina has its own OSHA plan; therefore, the Manchester Creek WWTP is subject to this regulation. The existing PSM plan was developed by Wiedeman & Singleton, Inc. in July 2005.\n\n\n\n1.3 Goals and Objectives\n\n\n\nThe mission of the Manchester Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is to provide adequate treatment for the wastewater produced by the City of Rock Hill, SC and its surrounding areas.  This process involves the addition of certain chemicals that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health. While such incidents are rare, they have occurred at other similar facilities.  \n\n\n\nState-of-the-art methods for reducing risks associated with utilizing highly mobile toxic chemicals, such as chlorine, have evolved in recent years.  The newer risk management techniques consist of a comprehensive management system designed to promote responsible and disciplined operation, maintenance, and emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe overall goal in developing and maintaining the Manchester Creek WWTP RMProgram is to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury or death from the accidental release of chlorine liquid or gas.  The RMProgram is not a substitute for other conventional health and safety programs.\n\n\n\nThis document will require periodic updates and modifications.  Changes in key personnel, chlorine vendors and modifications to the treatment process are among the items that require Plan modifications.  Specific items and their respective timetables for Plan modification are included herein.  \n\n\n\nSeveral elements of the Risk Management Program directly or indirectly reference plans and procedures contained within other pre-existing documents (i.e. O&M manuals, Process Safety Man"
