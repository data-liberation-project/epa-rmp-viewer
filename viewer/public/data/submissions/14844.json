Our safety and environmental programs are managed by highly skilled employees, and are actively supported by the participation of all employees and all management, and a strong corporate staff. The goal of both the safety and environmental programs is prevention. Safety teams which focus on training and special projects have been formed in every department across this site. Although P&G's safety record is already among the best in the business, we are constantly striving for improvement. \n\nP&G is very committed to the safety and protection of the local residents. P&G employees are active members of several of  the local fire departments, response groups and other community, including Rotary and Keep CENLA Beautiful.   P&G has also supported the community in areas such as supplying mitigation materials to aid the city with a transportation incident.  \n\nP&G is also very committed to the safety and protection of the natural environment.  P&G Alexandria site employees have participated in the local Earth Day celebrations, have provided environmental training in schools, and is active in the Partners in Education program with Northwood High School. \n\n\nSOURCE + SUBSTANCES: PREVENTION, CONTROLS + MITIGATION  \n\nThe P&G Alexandria site manufactures laundry detergent. Oleum is one of the key raw materials used to make the detergent. Oleum is delivered to the site by specially designed railcars, and is unloaded into one of  two storage tanks. While not required by any regulation, our storage tanks made of extra-thick stainless steel and designed to meet Pressure Vessel code details.  Additionally, they are located in a diked area and enclosed in  a metal building. The tanks are routinely visually inspected and"

      "SummaryText": " the metal walls are tested for integrity. The unloading area is also spill protected. The storage and unloading areas are monitored by continuous video cameras placed in critical areas. The storage tanks are heated to the minimum level in order to keep the oleum in a liquid state for use in our process. Slight wisps or vapors which may occur when opening the railcar for unloading and during maintenance are collected in a mist vacuum and scrubber system. Oleum is completely consumed in the reactions in the processes. \n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS:  Minimizing the potential for accidental releases\n\nA \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA as an instantaneous release of the single largest vessel (one storage tank), outdoors, during a time of light winds and stable weather conditions. An instantaneous release of this kind could be caused by, for example,  an earthquake or by an airplane hitting the tank. The worst case release assumes that no emergency response would occur, even though both site personnel and the local Haz Mat team are trained to respond to this type of spill. The spilled liquid contents of an entire storage tank would be confined to an existing diked area. \n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is defined by the EPA as a 15 minute release from a leaking unloading line at more normal weather conditions. If necessary, the foam suppression systems and/or shutting valves to shut down the operation could be activated  within 15 minutes.   The facility has also modeled its Alternative Release Scenario.  This scenario can also be located in the RMPlan.\n\nSAFETY, RELEASE PREVENTION, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\nThe first line of defense at our plant is accident prevention. A  detailed hazard study was conducted to identify potential points from which oleum may be spilled or leaked from the process. These points have received special consideration during the process design, the training of operators and maintenance personnel, and in the development of our accident prevention a"

Training, maintenance, controls, operating practices, and purchasing requirements are updated based on the results of these hazard studies. \n\nThe entire oleum system has numerous and redundant process controls, detection and alarm systems, and an emergency shut-down system. When operating, highly skilled operators monitor the process from the control rooms equipped with cameras and computers that monitor important data on the liquid levels in the tanks, the temperature and pressure of the tank contents, and the tank's volume.  Oleum is only unloaded into a tank when there is enough space to allow unloading all the contents of the railcar.  This procedure of hookup-unload- disconnect only once per railcar  minimizes the risk of accidental spills.\n\nIn the event of an accident, the site has systems to react to the spill or leak quickly. Spills or leaks of oleum can be quickly communicated by personnel on the scene from phones located in the control rooms. The Police and Fire departments have procedures to  manage communications and instructions to the public by means of TV and radio broadcasts, and by direct communications in the streets of affected neighborhoods. \n\n\n\nHISTORY OF SAFE OPERATIONS\n\nThe P&G Alexandria site has an excellent history of oleum system safety. We have had zero RMP 68 incidents within the past five years. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nTechnicians handling oleum have been qualified in all of our standard operating procedures. The operating procedures include both routine and non-routine operations. Thirty employees are trained as part of an onsite Team to handle emergencies; with each shift having trained members. All employees participate in annual Emergency Response drills. The results of both hazard assessments and the emergency response drills are communicated to the operating and unloading teams. \n\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan has be"
