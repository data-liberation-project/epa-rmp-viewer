      "SummaryText": "16145 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\nDeRidder Paper Mill Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\n\n\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility processes.  The Boise Cascade Corporation (Boise Cascade) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\tSUBSTANCES\n\nBoise Cascade owns and operates the DeRidder Paper Mill (the Mill) located in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana.  The Mill produces linerboard and newsprint products.  The Mill purchases pine wood grown in the region, chips the timber, utilizes mechanical and chemical methods to produce pulp from wood fibers and processes the pulp into linerboard and newsprint products.  Methods used in the pulping process include cutting, debarking, chipping, grinding, thermomechanical processes and cooking.  Some newsprint pulp is bleached.  Historically, Boise Cascade has bleached with chlorine as the bleaching agent.  \n\nThe Mill is implementing changes in bleaching operations to prepare to meet the upcoming Cluster Rule requirements.

Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint of chlorine yields the greatest radius of impact which reaches public receptors.  In addition, the Mill is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM).  Therefore, the DeRidder Paper Mill is classified as a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case release of a chlorine is based on the Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2) developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  The ERPG-2 for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was identified to be one 90-ton railcar of chlorine.  The chlorine railcar is transported on site and is utilized as a storage vessel while the chlorine is piped directly to the bleaching process. The ARP Program requirement for a toxic worst-case scenario is to assume that the total quantity is released in ten minutes.\n\nThe storage quantity, toxic endpoint, and distance to the endpoint for chlorine for the worst-case release, using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) equations, is presented in Table 2.  \n\nTABLE 2\nDistance to Endpoint for Worst-Case Scenario\n\nChemical Name\tWeight(lbs"

Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\nThe following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n\u00b7\tRelease rate dependent upon scenario;\n\u00b7\tUse of typical meteorological conditions at the stationary source;\n\u00b7\tActual release height; and\n\u00b7\tConsideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill does not have any flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of regulated flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance is required under the ARP program.  The regulated toxic substances at the Mill are chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  Hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenarios of chlorine and chlorine dioxide have been identified for the Mill. \n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is used for water treatment and is located near the power house area.  There are ten one-ton chlorine cylinders attached by a common header which feeds the chlorine to the water treatment facilities.  An approximately 3/8-inch diameter leak develops in the header.  The release duration occurs over a 60-minute period.   The release occurs without any active or passive mitigation.\n\t\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative-case release of chlorine using an accidental release model is presented in Table 3.

For chlorine dioxide, the ARS is defined as a rupture of a 4-inch diameter transfer line leading from a 1% ClO2 solution storage tank to the bleach plant.  The transfer pump operates at 200 gallons per minute (gpm).  The spill is assumed to proceed at the pump rate.  Because of the high vapor pressure of ClO2 and the turbulent action of the spill, all of the CLO2 is assumed to volatilize as soon as the solution impacts the ground.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative-case release of chlorine dioxide using RMPComp* is presented in Table 3.

These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \nThe DeRidder Paper Mill actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \nProcess Safety Information\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThe Mill uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Mill has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform Mill personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Mill evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Mill personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nThe DeRidder Paper Mill conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.
