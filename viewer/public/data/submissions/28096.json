      "SummaryText": "A.  Introduction\nRoyster-Clark is a supplier of fertilizer, agrichemical, seed and other inputs to farmers.  Bulk and packaged products are received via transport trucks or rail cars, depending on the location, and stored for the eventual sale to farmers.  This facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.  There have been no accidents in the past five years.  The facility?s safety record is a direct result of the emphasis placed on safety by management and employees alike.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with state anhydrous ammonia regulations.  The company?s Environmental, Health & Safety staff provides technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits on a regular basis.  Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and also on a monthly basis in the form of a monthly safety meeting.  In addition to safety training, employees may be certified in First Aid and CPR.  The anhydrous ammonia tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies.  Pressurized tank(s) and plumbing are tested according to the standards for pressure vessel testing. Royster-Clark believes safety and environmental stewardship must be second nature to all employees and contractor personnel.\n\nC.  Emergency Response Policies and Program\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings.  This facility has an Emergency Plan which covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures.  The Emergency Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process.  The procedures provided in the Emergency Plan are shared with all employees a"

The local emergency planning committee and fire department personnel are furnished a copy of the Emergency Plan for this facility and invited for a tour on a regular basis.\n\nD.  Worst-case Scenario\nEach anhydrous ammonia tank is equipped with pressure relief valves and excess flow valves for safety purposes.  Based on the worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA, there would be public receptors within the affected zone for this facility.  The EPA requires a very conservative worst-case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of the largest stationary tank with a complete loss of product occurring over a ten minute period of time. \n\nIt should be noted EPA describes the worst-case scenario as:  ?Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative?These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one half hour to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.? (EPA550-B-98-003, Section 4.2)\n\nRoyster-Clark believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture are extremely unlikely because of the routine testing and safety procedures that are implemented such as daily inspections and constant monitoring.  \n\nE.  Alternative-case Scenario\nAnhydrous ammonia stationary storage tank(s) are filled via transport trucks and/or rail cars with product being dispensed or transferred into small portable nurse tanks.

      "SummaryText": "e most likely release scenario would be a rupture of a hose connecting a nurse tank to the storage tank riser.  The conditions selected for this scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of loss of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nF.  Five Year Accident History\nThis facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of it?s personnel or contractors as a result of the RMP covered process.  In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences during the entire operation period.  Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\n\nG.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nRoyster-Clark and this facility continuously look for ways to enhance the safety of this location.  Monthly safety inspections are conducted which result in corrective actions; annual equipment inspections are also conducted, and detailed Royster-Clark sponsored environmental health & safety audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nH.  Summary\nThe employees of Royster-Clark are extremely proud of our safety record and vast improvements made in both environmental stewardship and safety over the last twenty years.  We believe with our programs and policies in place and with the continued efforts of our personnel, we will maintain our safety record and our safe facility environment for the public, our customers and our employees for years to come."
