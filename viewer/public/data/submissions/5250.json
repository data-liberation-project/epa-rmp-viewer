This station is an odor control station treating the wastewater from the city of Poulsbo. This station has the capacity to hold two one ton cylinders of chlorine gas. One container  is on line and one is a spare. The station is monitored by radio telemetry and is checked two or more times a week. The station is not staffed.\n\n* The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies available to the employees of Kitsap County Public Works, who work at the station include:\n\nRelated Policies contained in the Kitsap County Public Works Safety Manual, Revised 10-98.\nAfter Normal Working Hours Duty List - Standard Operating Procedures.\nChlorine Leaks - Standard Operating Procedures.\nLock Out - Tag Out, The Policy.\nConfined Space, The Policy.\nRespiratory Protection,  The Policy.\nAll these documents are written at the direction of Randy Casteel, Director of Public Works.\nChemical Hazard Communications\nIncludes Department of Labor and Industries Guidelines \nWAC 296-62-054 through WAC 296-62-05425\n\n* The Worst Case Scenarios for the Lemolo Chlorine Station, L.S. # 96\nThis would be a chlorine gas release from the Lemolo Chlorine station. This would be a gas release after midnight, when there is no one at the station. The chlorine leak detector senses a chlorine leak and the radio telemetry sends in a chlorine leak alarm to the Central Kitsap Tr. Plant auto dialer. The auto dialer calls out the on call personnel.

State Patrol and the fire department personnel will monitor roads and control traffic in the area. Areas affected mainly would be residential and the Hiway 305 corridor. \nWorst case scenarios for the Lemolo Chlorine station gas release are reduced by the checking of the chlorine tanks, gas piping, detectors and radio telemetry twice a week. The chlorine and telemetry equipment is on a database monitored by a periodic maintenance program. Personnel use this program which takes the manufacturers' maintenance recommendations for a piece of equipment and use the information to perform maintenance in a timely fashion. The chlorine Supply Company checks the chlorine cylinders on a regular basis.\n\n* The alternative scenario for the Lemolo Chlorine station.\nThere is a chlorine leak at the Lemolo Chlorine station.
