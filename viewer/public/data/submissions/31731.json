The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The GCC PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of GCC to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \n\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.  Company policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency response capabilities; and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  Key employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually; emergency response equipment is maintained on-site and relationships with local Fire Departments have been established.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (San Luis Obispo County UPA) and the California Dept of Forestry Fire Department.  The company strives to execute its emergency response policy through trained and skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate tools and equipment.\n\n1.2 "

      "SummaryText": " General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGuadalupe Cooling Company (GCC) is a refrigeration plant located 1.1 miles north of Guadalupe, CA. and was constructed in the early 1980?s.  The site occupies approximately 20 acres of land.   Several commercial neighbors are located on the same site, which is surrounded by row crops.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables; and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  \n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVac? Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Ice-making equipment, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.\n\nGCC is supported by an affiliate company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS).  WPS is a statewide and well-known provider of ammonia refrigeration equipment and maintenance services.  \n \n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  GCC strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are also integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\n\nChemical-Spec"

      "SummaryText": "ific Prevention Steps\n\n?Security patrol and traffic guards have been instituted\n?Entrance to the facility is closely monitored.  An ID Badge system has been implemented.\n?The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates.\n?Closed Circuit Cameras (CCTV) monitor the facility 24/7/365\n?Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals, etc.  Training is documented through the \"Personal Qualifications Standard\" booklet, which is in each employees training record file.\n?Only qualified personnel perform work on the process.  \n?Self-closing valves have been installed for process oil draining \n?The engine room is computer controlled with telephone access for monitoring and parameter changes.  The equipment may be shut down from off-site via phone if it were not possible to directly access the control area.\n?There is an automatic dialing machine that is connected to the computer control.  When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shut down setting, or if there is a power failure, this auto-dialer begins calling out to eight successive phone numbers to summon technicians to solve the problem.  Technicians are on-call 24/7/365.\n?GCC proactively trains its personnel in the benefits of good housekeeping.  There is a staff to maintain the general appearance of the facility on a day-to-day basis.\n\n1.4  Summary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\n?A minor accident in August 1999 was investigated for potential inclusion in this section, but did not qualify under current rules. \n?May 19, 2004 - Fan blade failure on a pressure cooling unit caused a reportable ammonia release event.  Emergency responders and regulatory agencies were notified.  The facility was evacuated until the problem was brought under control.  There were no injuries associated with the accident.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly traine"

Only the responding Fire Department(s) and GCC?s 1910.120 (q) trained personnel would respond to an actual emergency.  Emergency response equipment is maintained on-site.  \n\nThe facility maintains required written emergency planning documents.  Written ammonia emergency action procedures are detailed in the GCC ?Thirty Minute Plan?.  The Hazardous Material Business Plan and the Emergency Action Plan detail procedures for non-responding personnel.  The Hazardous Material Business Plan contains procedures for small spills and procedures for materials other than ammonia.  Each of these Plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.\n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n?Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n?Cal/ARP Seismic Assessment;\n?Compliance Audits;\n?Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n?Triennial IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections; and\n?GCC Inspection Protocol\n\nEach of the Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant.  Work Orders are established in parallel to identified needs.  Current planned changes to improve safety include:\n?Update and upgrade of the RMP/PSM Documents;\n?Online Ammonia PSM Technical Training Courses (Ammonia Technicians);\n?Improved/updated SOP?s;\n?Improved tagging and documentation of process valves;\n?Improved labeling of process piping; \n?Improved maintenance schedule;\n?Seismic Improvements; and\n?Programmable Logic Controller Upgrade\n\nImplementation of these measures has commenced according to the schedule set by the management of GCC."
