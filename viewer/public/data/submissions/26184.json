With the ammonia tank being filled by an overhead line with a diptube into the vessel, any unloading hose problem will not result in tank leakage.  Only the tank truck would need to be isolated, (4) Manual alarms in unit to notify personnel in the immediate area of the release, and (5) Aqueous Ammonia is replacing Anhydrous Ammonia in 1999.  This will eliminate ammonia release scenarios with off-site consequences.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE SAMPLES:  (1) Water deluge system with remote activation to minimize release impact, (2) Alarm systems, (3) Trained emergency responders, (4) Communication link to off-site responders, (5) Mobile fire protection equipment, (6) Member of mutual aid groups wit other plants.\nHEALTH HAZARDS FROM EXPOSURE:\nLow concentrations may irritate the nose, throat and lungs. Symptoms include a burning sensation, discomfort/difficulty in breathing/coughing.  First aid measures are: Remove to fresh air, and get medical attention if symptoms persist.

A safety system activated as designed to prevent the escalation of the release scenario, releasing the small volume of ethylene (2,000 lbs.) at high pressure (25,000 psig) to the atmosphere.  This small vapor cloud ignited and carbon fallout landed off-site.  This resulted in vehicle clean-up costs of $40 for a neighbor.\n3/31/2000 - A polyethylene reactor experienced a runaway reaction. A safety system activated as designed to prevent the escalation of the release scenario, releasing the small volume of ethylene (1,000 lbs.) at high pressure  to the atmosphere.  The rumble from the release allegedly caused a glass in a neighbors front door to crack.

      "SummaryText": "Chevron Phillips Cedar Bayou facility is a subsidiary of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, headquartered in Houston, Texas.  The Cedar Bayou Plant is located on the North side of Interstate 10 between Cedar Bayou and Sjolander, and is situated on approximately 1000 acres.  The plant was initially built by Gulf Oil and began operating in 1963. In 1984, it became part of Chevron through the Chevron-Gulf merger, and is currently part of the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP, as the result of a joint venture.\n\nThe basic business of Cedar Bayou is to produce simple olefins, mostly ethylene and propylene, and derivatives which include polyethylene resins, normal alpha olefins, and polyalphaolefins.  These products are primarily intermediates which are processed further by our customers to produce finished consumer products.  End uses for our products include: plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubes and hydraulic fluids, and waxes.  We also convert by-product acetylene into acetylene black which is used in battery and magnetic tape production.\n\nELABORATION ON ACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nThe Cedar Bayou plant complies with our Chevron Corporate Policy 530 for Protecting People and the Environment and the Chemical Manufacturers' Association (CMA) Responsible Care initiative.\n\nThe processes at Cedar Bayou comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This standard is intended only for the management of highly hazardous chemicals.  However, Cedar Bayou has applied its programs and policies to the entire plant, regardless of the degree of hazard.  Specific programs include:  \n(1)    A detailed hazard assessment conducted on all processes to ensure they have been designed safely,\n(2)    An intensive equipment inspection program to ensure equipment remains in good condition to prevent releases,\n(3)    A work permit system to ensure that all work on process equipment is conducted in a safe manner,\n(4)    A Management of Change syst"
