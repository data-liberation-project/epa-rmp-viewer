The RMP submittal, and other information concerning activities that Denver Water employs to prevent accidental releases, can be found on the Denver Water Web Page (http://www.denverwater.org/)\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are presented in the Emergency Planning and Response Sections of the Moffat Water Treatment Plant RMP manual. Denver Water takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of systems using hazardous substances, and the safe handling of water treatment chemicals. \nDenver Water has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\nDenver Water management, as a public utility, recognizes the importance of providing a safe working environment, and taking all reasonable measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in the design of the facilities, the commitment to training and the procedures described and referenced in the RMP manuals.\nApplicable Sources and Regulated Substances\nMoffat Water Treatment Plant treats up to 210 million gallons per day.  The regulated hazardous substances stored at this facility include chlorine and aqua ammonia.  Both chemicals are used in the treatment process to ensure the water we serve to our customers is safe to drink. The chlorine is stored on site in a maximum on-site inventory of twenty-four (24) 1-ton liquefied chlorine gas storage containers (48,000 lbs.)  Aqua ammonia is also stored on site in t"

This quantity of actual ammonia (approximately 15,000 lbs.) is below the threshold quantity established by the RMP program of 20,000 lbs. of ammonia.\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  For the worst-case release scenario, the regulation is clear.  The assumption is that the single largest container of a regulated substance (one-ton container of chlorine) is released over a ten-minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered.  Worst-case meteorological conditions are also assumed to be present.  The RMP*Comp program was used to determine distances to toxic endpoints.  For chlorine, a distance of 0.9 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated for a release of the entire contents of a one-ton container of chlorine.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine consists of a release of the contents of a single one-ton container of chlorine over a one-hour period due to a severed 5/8-inch valve.  Due to protective measures taken during movement of the tank, the release was anticipated to occur indoors.  In the event of a release, the building is vented to the outdoors through a chlorine scrubber system.  Using this scenario, a distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint was calculated.\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine System\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Moffat Water Treatment Plant RMP manual.  The prevention programs include the following elements:\n\u00b7 Employee participation, which includes provisions for active participation by plant employees in the development and implementation of the plant RMP programs, as well as ready access to program information.\n\u00b7 Process safety information, which has been collated into the RMP manual located in the Moffat Water Treatment Pl"

The program is described in detail in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP compliance manual and meets the requirement of 40 CFR 68.95.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\nChanges for Improved Safety\nSignificant modifications and changes were made to the chlorine system in the fall of 1999 and spring of 2000. The storage room for chlorine was made larger for maintenance and accessibility to the chlorine cylinders.  All chlorine process equipment and storage was moved and located in the same building for scrubber capabilities.  The new system was first operational in May of 2000. Ideas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\nDuring the development of the Moffat Water Treatment Plant RMP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may have been implemented, all were considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.  It is anticipated that a Process Hazar"
