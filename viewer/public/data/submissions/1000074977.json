Chlorine used in the chlorination of the drinking water is stored at this location.  A maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in one ton cylinders.  The City of Alexandria Hwy 1 Site is included in written community emergency response plan.  In case of a chlorine leak, the City of Alexandria has an emergency response policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center as well as local fire and police departments.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evacuating citizens in the affected area.  Currently, the City uses daily inspection, leak detection and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.  On-going operator training and preventive maintenance continue to be key tools to ensure the safety of the public.  The City of Alexandria Water Department Highway 1 Site has no history of reportable release for chlorine.  There have been no injury or property loss associated with this chemical at this site. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following provides a description of the risk management program at the City of Alexandria Water department Highway 1 Site. \r\n \r\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe City of Alexandria Water Department Highway 1 Site is committed to the safety of our workers, the public, and the environment.
