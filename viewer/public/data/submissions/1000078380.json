      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nThis document comprises the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. facility located at 18700 Highway 14 North in Mojave, California 93501 (also referred to as the Mojave Plant).  The facility is located in an undeveloped area approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the town of Mojave.  The Mojave Airport, which is the nearest neighboring facility, is approximately 1 mile away. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to comply with various risk management planning requirements.  These are set forth in Section 25535(d) of Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code (also known as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program - CalARP) and Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR Part 68).  The latter is also known as the federal Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs or the federal RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe scope of the RMP includes all operations conducted at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. Mojave facility which involve the storage, handling and/or use of chlorine.   Chlorine is the only regulated substance which is handled at the facility above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\n\n\nES 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nPRIMARY OPERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe primary operation conducted at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc. Mojave facility is the manufacture of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride solutions (NAICS Code 32518, SIC Code 2819).  The primary components utilized in the process include water, hydrochloric acid, chlorine, and scrap iron.  Chlorine is a regulated substance subject to the above-referenced regulations, and is the only such regulated substance handled at the facility.  Provided below is a brief description of the storage, handling, and use of chlorine at the site.\n\n\n\nSTORAGE, HANDLING AND USE OF CHLORINE \n\n\n\nThe chlorine management program consists of the following components:\n\n\n\n- A maximum of twenty 90-ton railcars of chlorine"

      "SummaryText": " (i.e., a maximum onsite inventory of 3,600,000 pounds of chlorine) each temporarily stored on a secure, company-owned rail spur;\n\n- Two continuous chlorinators for reacting water, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid to manufacture ferrous chloride solution;\n\n- Three scrap iron dissolver tanks, along with two expansion (overflow) tanks;\n\n- Three chlorinators utilized to convert ferrous chloride solution to ferric chloride solution; \n\n- A number of heat exchangers supplied by recirculating cooling water from a cooling tower; and\n\n- System piping, controls and instrumentation.\n\n\n\nNinety-ton railcars of chlorine are delivered to the facility and staged in dedicated spots for unloading.  Liquid chlorine from the railcars, dilute ferrous chloride, and water are mixed in two continuous chlorinators.  The resulting solution is circulated through three dissolver tanks containing scrap iron/steel and hydrochloric acid.  This process results in the manufacture of a weak ferrous chloride solution.  The dilute solution is continuously recirculated until a rich ferrous chloride solution is made.  \n\n\n\nThe rich ferrous chloride solution is then filtered before transfer to a series of three chlorinators in the ferric plant.  Chlorine is added to the chlorinators until the desired concentration of ferric chloride solution is manufactured.  The resulting material is then sent to finished product storage tanks.\n\n\n\nCentral Emergency Vacuum Relief Device (CEVRD)\n\nThe Mojave Plant has and maintains a central emergency vacuum relief device (CEVRD).  The CEVRD is connected to the overhead relief of each of the chlorinator vessels onsite.  The CEVRD utilizes a solution of ferrous chloride to remove excess chlorine in one stage.  In another stage of the CEVRD, recirculating water removes any excess hydrochloric acid before the air stream is released to atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAs an additional mitigation measure, the facility installed an automated railcar valve closure system (\"UniPro\" system) that is ac"

The UniPro system is tied into the facility's emergency stop system.\n\n\n\n\n\nES 2.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\n RMP regulations require the evaluation of at least two types of release scenarios for their potential to impact off-site populations:\n\n\n\n- the worst-case release; and\n\n- an alternative release (that is more credible or more likely).\n\n\n\nIn developing these release scenarios, a number of hypothetical accidental release scenarios were postulated and evaluated for the RMP.  These scenarios were categorized into worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  Each of these categories of hypothetical accidental release scenarios is discussed in the technical studies maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nES 3.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nDuring the five years preceding the submittal of this RMP, the facility did not have a chlorine release incident that meets the five-year accident reporting criteria. The facility did not have a chlorine release incident that resulted in at least one of the following:\n\n- Onsite injuries;\n\n- Onsite deaths or significant property damage; or\n\n- Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nES 4.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program at Kemira Water Solutions, Inc.

As such, the Mojave Plant currently has emergency action plans and emergency evacuation plans in place.  These programs work together to mitigate the effects of unplanned releases or events.  However, as a continuous measure to improve safety, the facility reviews its emergency response plan, evacuation plan, and fire prevention plan on a regular basis.  This review process also ensures that the facility incorporates the latest safety developments into its existing programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nES 6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA detailed hazard and operability study (i.e., hazards analysis) was performed on all operations involving chlorine in order to evaluate the potential for accidental releases in November 2016.
