The facility is completely enclosed and equipped with gas detection equipment, alternate power, fire suppression,supplied air, emergency lighting and a scrubber system. The scrubber system is designed to remove more than one ton of chlorine gas. When activated, the chlorine gas detection equipment sounds an alarm locally and remotely. The alarm is presented to the operator(s) on the SCADA system and can be addressed remotely. As a redundant measure, the alarm system automatically dials a phone queuqe, alerting operators of an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nOther prevention measures include operator training, proactive chemical specifications requiring chemical vendors to adhere to certain quality requirements and leak repair kits which can be used to prevent a release to the environment.",

      "SummaryText": "The City of Round Rock Water Treatment Plant takes water from Lake Georgetown and processes it so that is suitable for human consumption and meets drinking water standards. The water treatment plant uses chlorine to achieve primary disinfection of the city's water supply. Chlorine is delivered in 2000 pound containers and stored in the chlorine feed facility. \n\n\n\nThe City of Round Rock is committed to operating its facilities in a safe manner. In 2004, the city spent nearly twenty million dollars upgrading the water treatment facilities. Included in those upgrades were many process safety improvements and a new chlorine feed facility.  The safeguards to prevent an accidental release of chlorine include a scrubber system, standard operating procedures, operator training, leak detection and system safety devices. \n\n\n\nOperator training and standard operating procedures have permitted the water treatment plant to operate accident and incident free since 1999. While it is highly unlikely that a leak substantial enough to empty a one ton chlorine container could occur, the impact of such a release on the public and the environment would be minimal. Treatment plant staff are trained to control releases and mitigate minor emergencies.  All treatment plant staff have recently been through a 40-hour Emergency Response Training (ERT) at our facility in order to better assess our needs in the event of an emergency with our chlorine gas facility.  Staff have been briefed and drilled about emergency situations and are comfortable handling them if required.  Local emergency response organizations such as the Round Rock Fire Department and the Williamson County HazMat Unit have established procedures for addressing releases at the water plant. Site alarms allow plant personnel to evaluate the hazard and determine the best response.\n\n"
