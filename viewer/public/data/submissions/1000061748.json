      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Desert View Power plant was constructed during 1990-91. It consists of two biomass-fired boilers to supply steam to a single turbine generator producing 47 MW of electric power. Electric power is transmitted directly to the Imperial Irrigation District. Anhydrous ammonia is utilized on-site because it is required by a permit condition for the purpose of reducing the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the combustor flue gas. The Desert View Power, Inc. process is the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system of NOx emissions process and is classified as an RMP Program Level 3. Ammonia (anhydrous) is also regulated by the OSHA PSM Program. The ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon (9,840 gallon working capacity) ASME code pressure vessel. With 265 psi safety valves to control over pressure in the tank and excess flow valves to control leaks that could be caused by potential breaks in the piping. The ammonia NOx control system operates at a pressure of 50 psig.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive review was conducted in 2019, including a review of the P&IDs, operating procedures, auditing and inspection program, maintenance of the system, training program, and emergency preparedness. In addition, a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study was conducted in October 2019. A Hazard Assessment was completed in October 2019 and demonstrates the worst-case release and alternative case release scenarios for the facility.\n\n\n\nAt Desert View Power, Inc., the Safety Supervisor, Kit Blessing, is responsible for the coordination and managerial oversight of the RMP/PSM Program, while others may assist in responsibilities and coordination. The Plant Manager, Philip Jones, supports the Safety Supervisor and is responsible for overseeing operations and maintenance personnel's use of the program.\n\n\n\nIt important to note that sulfuric acid and sodium hypochlorite was included in the original 1991 Plan but are not included in the EPA's or OSHA's list of hazardous substances. This Plan "
