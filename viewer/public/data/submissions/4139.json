Our facility has one 30,000 gallon tank for storing anhydrous, an atmospheric-pressure 15,000 gallon tank for storing aqua, and an atmospheric-pressure 7,000 gallon tank for storing aqua.  We have equipment for receiving anhydrous by truck and by rail, equipment for receiving aqua by truck, and equipment for transferring anhydrous and aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Pull-away shut off valves that immediately shut to minimize the amount of anhydrous released if a truck accidentally leaves before disconnecting hoses.\n2. Emergency shut off valves to minimize the amount anhydrous released if anything unusual occurs during loading or unloading.\n3. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tank if any anhydrous hose or line breaks.\n4. Pressure relief valves on the anhydrous storage tank to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n5. Diking around the aqua storage area, to contain any accidental spills.\n6. Annual inspections by independent inspectors to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the Pendleton Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the enti"

According to information supplied by the EPA the impact from this scenario would extend 6.59 miles from our facility, and would affectt the city of Pendleton, Pendleton schools, a hospital, and a correctional institution.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the impact from such a release of anhydrous would extend 2000 feet and might affect one residence, but no hospitals, schools, or commercial areas.  The effect from such a release of aqua would only extend 480 feet and would not impact any residences, schools, or commercial areas."
