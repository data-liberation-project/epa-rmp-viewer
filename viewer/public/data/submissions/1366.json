THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS USE GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHEN FILLING NURSE TANKS.  SAFETY WATER IS ALWAYS ON HAND IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 53,000 POUNDS WITH A DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT OF 1.63 MILES WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT APPROXIMATELY 72 AREA RESIDENTS.\n\nBIG CREEK FERTILIZER IS PROUD OF OUR SAFETY RECORD AND TAKE OUR TRAINING SERIOUSLY.  WITH THIS IN MIND, IT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO REPORT THAT NO INJURY ACCIDENTS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HAVE OCCURED AT OUR STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLANS ARE SHARED WITH THE COUNTY'S LEPC AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE HAZARDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ARE DISCUSSED IN OUR PLANS AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN THIS AREA HAVE AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
