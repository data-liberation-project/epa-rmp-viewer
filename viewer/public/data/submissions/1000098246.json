The Houston Chemical Plant's accidental release prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of operations from planning to operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to applicable standards and inspection is an integral part of the preventative maintenance system.  \n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.  \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called \"Plioflex\" rubber.  To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcess Safety Management at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Houston plant complies with all requirements of both the OSHA PSM standard and EPA RMP regulation.
