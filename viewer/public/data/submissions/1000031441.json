E&J Gallo senior management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  E&J Gallo - Livingston's safety and environmental policies are administered by the EHS Manager, who conducts regular inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs at the facility.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nE&J Gallo personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the systems. In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and Maintenance Manager and/or their supervisor. The Maintenance Manager and/or supervisor will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AN"

      "SummaryText": "D REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo - Livingston facility is located at 18000 W. River Rd. in Livingston, California, which is approximately 2.3 miles east of Highway 165 and 3.6 miles southwest of Highway 99.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of agricultural and sparse residential areas. The regulated substance of concern at E&J Gallo - Livingston is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses approximately 263,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within seven closed ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\n\n\nEach of the seven refrigeration systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for wine chilling. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program. This prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\n\n\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n-Process safety information is provided to all applicable employees upon hire and is accessible at all times.\n\n-In depth process hazard analysis are completed every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the PSM standard.\n\n-Written operating procedures (kept up to date) are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\n-Training is provided to all employees upon hire, and refresher training is given at least every three years or upon request.\n\n-Operators, mechanics"

      "SummaryText": ", and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety.\n\n-Pre-startup safety reviews are conducted to insure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment.\n\n-A program is in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process, which includes written procedures, training requirements, equipment deficiency requests for employees, work orders, scheduled maintenance, and documentation.\n\n-A hot work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly.\n\n-A management of change system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely.\n\n-Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\n-Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\n\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in overall safety. The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of the operations, maintenance, and management personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study (July 31 - August 1, 2012) found that there has been one release of ammonia from the ammonia chiller process that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years (August 2007 - August 2012).  There have been no accidents that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History at the facility. Such \"accidents\" would involve on-site deaths, injuries, or significant damage; or known, off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n\n\nOn February 15, 2012, a leak occurred from a pressure relief valve on the oil cooler of Compressor 3C. At approximately 8:45am, the leak was detected by a tank inspector. The tank inspector cal"

      "SummaryText": "led a refrigeration operator who called the refrigeration mechanic. The refrigeration operator then called the production lead and maintenance lead. The refrigeration mechanic and the ERT stopped the leak by switching the three-way valve. The California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA) and the National Response Center (NRC) were notified. The leak was stopped at 9:05am, lasting a total of 20 minutes and releasing approximately 330 gallons of ammonia. The release was caused by a vapor relief valve being installed on a liquid line.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo - Livingston facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe E&J Gallo - Livingston facility has a trained Emergency Response Team onsite that responds to emergency situations, including chemical releases. The facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, conducted on July 31 - August 1, 2012, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the"
