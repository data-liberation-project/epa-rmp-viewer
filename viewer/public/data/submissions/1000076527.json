If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire Protection District Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a finished product storage and shipping warehouse.  Finished product stored on site includes pesticide liquid and granular materials, and storage of aerosol pesticide finished products containing propellants. Several types of propellants are used in the insecticide aerosol can products which include NP-70 (propane/n-butane) and Dimethyl Ether (DME). NP-70 (propane/n-butane) is chosen as a representative sample since it has the worst-case impact.  The quantity of cans stored in the warehouse puts us over the 10,000 lbs propane/n-butane threshold.  The worst-case scenario is based on a case of 12 aerosol cans exploding. The RMP modeling was based upon a mixture: equal amounts of butane and propane.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations for storage of aerosol products.  The warehouse facility complies with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)Code 30B Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products (2015). \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history:  The Fenton warehouse is a new storage location and new construction in 2019.  Aerosol finished products will be relocated into the warehouse in May 2019.  There is no five-year accident history for this address.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving storage of aerosol cans, it is our policy to notify the Fenton Fire District Fire Department and request that they"
