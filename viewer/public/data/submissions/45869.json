      "SummaryText": "THE LUBRIZOL CORPORATION - DEER PARK PLANT, DEER PARK, TX.  77536 (8/05)\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lubrizol Corporation is committed to improving the safety of our products and processes. As part of Lubrizol's philosophy, we believe in maintaining the health and safety of our employees, customers, community neighbors, and in protecting the environment.  \n\nLubrizol's Deer Park facility was founded in 1951 and is located on 180 acres on Tidal Road. The plant is staffed by nearly 500 full-time Lubrizol employees and more than 100 contractors. Each year the plant is recognized for community involvement in such areas as Partners in Education, Junior Achievement, Texas Scholars,  D.A.R.E., Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA, YWCA, Boys and Girls Harbor, and numerous other charitable events. \n\nLubrizol emphasizes prevention of incidents, however, we have a very dynamic emergency preparedness program should an unexpected event occur. Lubrizol is an active member of Channel Industries Mutual Aide (CIMA), the largest chemical plant mutual aide organization in the world.  We work closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC). We also are active supporters of the American Chemical Council's (ACC) Responsible Care program.  \n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lubrizol Deer Park plant manufactures specialty chemical additives for lubricating oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, automatic transmissions, gear drives, marine engines and tractors. RMP covered materials include chlorine, 2- methylpropene, propylene oxide, 1,3 butadiene, and pentane.  \n\nChlorine, used in our 198 and SCL-IOB/SCL products, is received by pipeline.  Chlorine does not remain in the products except in trace amounts. \n\n2-Methylpropene is used b"

It is received in rail cars and stored on-site. \n\n1,3 Butadiene was introduced to Deer Park in 2000.  It is used in the manufacturing of extreme pressure agents and corrosion inhibitors used in gear lubricants. It is received in rail cars and fed directly into the reactor where it is totally reacted to form a less hazardous material. \n\nPentane is a covered flammable used in the manufacture of marine diesel engine oils, automatic transmission fluids and other lubricating additive packages.  Lubrizol stores the material on-site.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol's Deer Park plant emphasizes prevention of incidents while maintaining an excellent emergency response program, good cooperation with its neighboring chemical plants through CIMA and open dialog with the community through participation in the local LEPC and CAC. Lubrizol has established direct hot lines to neighboring Shell and Oxychem plants.\n\nLubrizol's attention to accident prevention begins very early in the life of a product with their New Chemical Introduction Process (NCIP) that evaluates and manages all aspects of new chemical introduction from inception to production. A second process, New Chemical Issues Assessment (NCIA), ensures that pollution prevention, inherent safety, and product stewardship consideration are addressed starting at invention and continuing through development.  A Process Hazard Analysis is performed on all expansions or modifications to a manufacturing process with sufficient risk before being put into ser"

In 1993, we significantly reduced chlorine storage by converting three chlorine storage tanks into containment tanks for a potential chlorine release. In another example, 2- methylpropene is now brought on the premises via pipeline rather than stored on-site.\n\nFor new facilities or modifications the Deer Park plant uses generally accepted industry standards and practices. In addition, the plant has developed a multi-disciplinary set of Texas Standards for engineering, design, and construction standards and practices to be followed when industry standards and practices are not available. \n\nTo ensure that any new facility or facility modification is constructed according to good standards and practices the plant has a contractor qualification program. All contractor craftsmen must receive training from the Houston Area Contractors Safety Council (HACSC). Part of the training received at the HACSC is site specific to the Lubrizol facility. \n\nHot Work Permits are required before welding, brazing or any other activity that could generate a source of ignition is done. The Hot Work Permit documents that fire prevention and protection have been considered prior to beginning hot work. A key component of the Hot Work Permit is the requirement to have a \"Face to Face\" meeting at the work site between craftsman doing the work and the operator representative authorizing the work. Permits are required for any type of hazardous work, including \"Confined Space Entry\", Line Breaking\" or  \"General Work\".\n\nBefore a new or modified facility is put into operation , a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is conducted. The PSSR is a review by a multi-disciplinary team to confirm that the equipment is in accordance with design specifications and that adequate safety, operating, mai"

The Lubrizol Deer Park plant follows a formal Management of Change (MOC) procedure. The purpose of the MOC procedure is to assure that the technical basis of the change is understood and that the impact of safety and health is considered prior to the change. \n\nOperating procedures which identify safe operating limits, consequences of deviation from those limits and corrective action to be taken in the event a deviation from limits occurs, have been written for all of our processes. In addition, operating personnel receive training on the safe operation of their processes and are trained on process modifications, as they occur, as part of the Management of Change process. \n\nInspection and testing of existing pipe and equipment are key parts of the plant's Mechanical Integrity program. Piping and equipment are periodically inspected or tested to assure that they meet the design specifications. If deterioration is detected, the piping or piece of equipment will be repaired or replaced. This program identifies potential failures before they occur in a proactive fashion.\n\nThe Lubrizol Deer Park plant has a comprehensive PSM Compliance Audit Program. The purpose of the audit is to make sure that all the prevention programs are working and to provide a tool to stimulate improvement. We have established a procedure where we audit the entire plant once a year, and we perform an audit on a different processing unit each quarter. In addition to our internal audits in October 2003 we had a third party PSM / RMP compliance audit.\n\nAn employee safety program that we feel is very effective in reducing risk is called Safety Through Employee Participation (STEP). This is a voluntary observation and feed-back program. Approximately 85% of our employees have elected to participate. The STEP program identifies many near misses."

      "SummaryText": "Plant safety teams will then discuss and make recommendations to resolve potential problem areas.  There is a heavy emphasis on \"near miss investigations\" to prevent safety problems from occurring.\n \nIn addition to general protection measures, several of our RMP covered materials have special safeguards to reduce the likelihood and severity of potential releases.  2-Methylpropene is covered under monthly / quarterly fugitive emissions monitoring.  If leaks are detected they are repaired. Also, we have strategically placed 28 flammable gas detectors with alarms around the area to detect leaks should they occur. Due to the flammability of this material, the entire area is protected with sprinkler systems. Fire water curtains have also been engineered to assist in isolating the area from the rest of the plant in the event a release should occur. To insure a rapid response in the event of an emergency, a single button activation emergency shutdown system has been engineered into this unit. This unit is also equipped with a flare that would be used to flare off (burn) excess material should there be an upset condition.  \n\nFor chlorine Lubrizol follows Chlorine Institute recommended practices for safe handling. Emergency pressure relieving devices that are designed to protect equipment from over pressure by relieving into containment tanks rather than directly to the atmosphere. In units that use chlorine operators perform a chlorine line inspection every six hours to insure there are no leaks.  In addition, these units have numerous chlorine gas detectors that would alarm if chlorine was detected. Several emergency shutdown stations are located throughout the processing area where, by activation of a single push button, the chlorine can be isolated. We have also had our chlorine supplier visit the plant site and review our handling methods.\n\n \nFive Year Accident History: \n----------------------------------------\n\nThere have been no releases of EPA covered chemicals at L"

There has been one incident at the facility that triggered RMP reporting requirements with one employee injury.  That occurred in June 2005 when one employee was treated for chlorine inhalation and released.   The total release of chlorine was estimated at 1 pound.  Ad-hoc committees were formed to study, identify the root cause, and make recommendations for improvement.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol emphasizes prevention of incidents, however, we have a very active Emergency Preparedness Program. Emergency response teams are available in the plant 24 hours a day. The plant has more than 100 people trained in emergency response and an additional staff of over ninety people on our emergency  response paging system. Emergency response personnel at Lubrizol's Deer Park facility receive more than 6,000 aggregate hours of training annually. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant alarm system activates the Emergency Response Team to mitigate the incident.  Security through our alpha-numeric paging system, immediately sends out information to be provided to the public through our local LEPC, and uses our hotline to advise our immediate neighbors.  Training is provided throughout the year on various aspects of our emergency response program, and drills are conducted on-site, with our mutual aid organization, and our local LEPC.   Lubrizol utilizes an Incident Command System with documented emergency response procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n----------------------------------------------------\n \nThe Deer Park facility has embarked on an aggressive course to achieve \"STAR\" status in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).
