The facility has one refrigeration system which contains anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance under the RMP regulations.\n\nThe location has prepared a worst case release scenario, with distance to the toxic endpoint using the RMP Comp software. The alternate case release scenario, with distance to the toxic endpoint was prepared using RMPComp software also.\n\nIn accordance with RMP regulations, the general accidental release prevention program for this facility's ammonia refrigeration system is comprised of the following components: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Operator Training, Mechanical Integrity Procedures, Management of Change Procedures, Pre-Start Up Safety Procedures, Incident Investigation Procedures, and Hot Work Permit protocols. This program was developed with the participation of the affected employees and will be periodically audited for compliance as required by the RMP regulations. In addition, the facility has in place procedures for notifying contractors and thier employees of the hazards of the process. Chemical specific prevention steps are included within the program, including engineering and administrative controls designed to prevent and minimize accidental releases.\n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia.\n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which addresses accidental release of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Sebastian County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The facility is included in the LE"
