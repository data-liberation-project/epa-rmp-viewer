The safety and health of our employees is our number one priority at the plant, followed closely be the health and safety of our neighbors and the protection of the environment.\n\nTo minimize any risk to people and environment Channel follows state and federal guidelines in the storage and handling of these chemicals. Channel spill prevention policies include plant inspections every working shift, securing valves on storage vessels, and continual visual monitoring during the transfer of all chemicals. The company also maintains written emergency response plans in the event that there is a spill or accidental release. The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nChannel Chemical Corporation is located in the Bernard Bayou Industrial park in Harrison County, Mississippi. The company is located on an 11-acre parcel of land stretching between Seaway Road and Bernard Bayou. \n\nChannel Chemical is a toll manufacturer--which means it manufactures products for its customers, but produces no products of its own. The majority of the 20 different chemical products manufactured at the facility are for the oil field and soluble metals industries. In the process of producing these chemical products the company receives and ships a variety of chemicals in both 55-gallon drums and tank truck loads.\n\nHowever, Channel handles only one chemical in quantities that is considered hazardous (above threshold limits) according to the List of Regulated Toxic Substances of 40CFR part 68.130. This chemical is Formaldehyde Solution. The facility receives a tank truck of Formaldehyde Solution (4,900 gallons) an average of twice a month.  Channel stores a maximum of 5,000 gallons of the So"

It also stores two or three back up totes 250 gallons each) of the solution.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThis manufacturing facility is in compliance with state and federal laws and programs concerning the prevention of chemical spills including SWPPP, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and OSHA's Process Safety Management rules. In addition, operators are well versed in the proper handling and monitoring of Formaldehyde Solution whenever it is used in a manufacturing process. All of Channel's employees received regular training in spill prevention and spill clean up.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAccording to the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program, Formaldehyde Solution is the only chemical on Channel's plant site that falls within the perameters of this Risk Management Plan--meaning that the chemical is on the Hazardous Chemical List (CAA 112(r)), and the Channel stores it in a quantity above the List's \"Threshold Quantity.\"   There has been no accidental release related to Formaldehyde Solution in the past five years.\n\nHowever, Channel Chemical did experience an accidental chemical release of another chemical on the CAA 112(r) list. The chemical is Anhydrous Ammonia and Channel stores this chemical in quantities lower than the 10,000 pound Threshold Quantity that would have made it part of this RMP.  On February 23, 2003 at approximately 2am, an intruder entered Channel Chemical's plant site and opened up one of the valves on Channel's anhydrous ammonia storage tank. It was later speculated by police detectives that the released was caused by a botched attempt to steal this chemical (which is commonly used in the drug trade). This release triggered the response of the county's Hazardous Materials Team, the Gulfport police and fire department, as well as the state's Department of Environmental Quality (and R"

Curing this time Interstate 10 traffic was detoured, the Gulfport airport was closed, several nearby hotels were evacuated, and nearby neighborhoods were advised to stay indoors until an all clear signal was given. Due to very calm wind conditions, the anhydrous ammonia vapor cloud of hung around the industrial park until it dispersed at sunrise. At 8am, an air monitoring technician from US Environmental Services traveled through the immediate area to make sure there were no readings of any ammonia left in the air. There was none, so everyone was allowed to return to the area.\n\nTwo persons sought medical treatment and were released. One was a police officer who was chased by the vapors as the wind shifted, and the second was a pedestrian passing nearby.  The police never caught the intruder, but found solid evidence that it was someone who was planning on stealing some anhydrous ammonia using make-shift canisters to carry the chemical in.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nChannel's Emergency Response Program is based on taking all actions necessary to reduce the threat of exposure to its employees, surrounding neighbors and to the environment.  Included in these efforts:\n--Regular updates to local fire department that includes an updated list of chemicals stored on Channel's site, an updated map of where the chemicals are stored, and a copy of any MSDS's for new chemicals stored on site.\n--Channel also tries to take all the local fire department personnel on tour of the plant whenever practical, and whenever requested by the local fire departments. This allows the department personnel to become familiar with the plant layout and ask questions about the plant and the chemicals stored here. It also allows Channel to get feedback from the fire department on improvements it mig"

Personnel also go through drills including what to do when an employee is injured and when/how to evacuate the plant in an emergency.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n--Channel plans to bring in outside trainers to update employees on proper precautions and procedures related to personal safety and the safety of others and the environment.\n--Channel is pursuing plans with a security company to hook up cameras, monitors, and alarms that will help ensure the safety of the employees and the environment."
