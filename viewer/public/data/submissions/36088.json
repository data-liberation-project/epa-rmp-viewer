Multiple feed points are provided to give flexibility in achieving disinfection goals. Disinfection is achieved by withdrawing gaseous chlorine from 1-ton cylinders, and feeding through chlorinators (with integral vacuum regulators), an automatic switchover assembly, rotameters, and injectors.\nNormally, two cylinders resting on the scale feed the system through one of two pipe manifolds. Up to four cylinders can feed simultaneously through the two manifolds. Typically, an additional two cylinders are stored at the facility. An underhung bridge crane is used for handling cylinders. The chlorine hoist and trolley has a two-ton capacity.\nFeed equipment consists of chlorinators with integral vacuum regulators to meter the gas under vacuum and injectors to create the vacuum and mix the gas with water for transport and application. The system is under vacuum from the ejector to the vacuum regulator at each ton cylinder. From the vacuum regulator to the ton cylinder, the system is pressurized. Pressurized chlorine piping is minimal, however.\nTwo chlorine leak detectors are provided in the chlorine storage room and one in the chlorination room. In addition to the alarm annunciator and rotating beacons, warning lights are installed near each entry to the chlorination room and the chlorine storage room. Also, an automated alarm system and auto-dialing equipment is installed to notify VWD personnel in the event of a leak.\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA?S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nVWD uses chlorine at the Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chlorine is transported to the facility by truck, stored onsite in one-ton cylinders, and used for water disinfection. Ty"

VWD?s PSM programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n - Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n - Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n - Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n - Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that VWD provides for its own employees.\n - Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all inspections.\n - Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n - Safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n - Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n - Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n - Development of an effective emergency response program.\n - Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM/RMP program,     and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.  \n - Independent audits of the entire PSM/RMP program every three years.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe VWD facility has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPON"

      "SummaryText": "SE PROCEDURES:\n\nEmergency procedures are described in VWD?s O&M Manual (Emergency Procedures, Section 10).  In the unlikely event of an accidental release of chlorine, the key elements of VWD?s emergency response program are as follows:\n - All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n - A team of supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n - The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\n - In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact a telephone call-down list that includes the local Fire Department and several nearby commercial establishments that could be affected if the wind were blowing toward them during the release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVEMENT SAFETY:\n\nBased on recent safety reviews that were conducted as part of the RMP evaluations, VWD is considering the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chemical releases:\n - Install scrubber system to treat chlorine leaks.\n - Improve security based on findings from the vulnerability assessment."
