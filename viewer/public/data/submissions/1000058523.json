Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of highly Hazardous Chemicals. Pursuant to PSM regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertsons has developed a comprehensive written PSM program to protect its employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals(anhydrous annonia)utilized onsite. Albertsons Brea DC has not experienced a release of anhydrous ammonia involving consequences that has affected the environment or offsite parties in the last 5 years. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Brea facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm, and was revalidated to meet PSM and RMP Requirements in August of 2016.  Albertsons PSM program implementation includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The program includes preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches"
