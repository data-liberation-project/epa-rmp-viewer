The Facility Policy\nThe management and employees of Central Erie Supply & Elevator Ass'n are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, Central Erie is prepared to work with local fire departments or other authories to mitagate any release and minimize the impact of the release to persons or enviroment.\n\nII.  Facility Information\nThe primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers to the farmers of the area.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and sold to farmers, as a crop production nutrient.\nThe maximum amount that could be stored is 200,000 pounds and that is considering both a 30,000 and a 18,000 gallon storage tanks.  The maximum quanity handled at any one time, would be the unloading of a semi-tanker, containing 24,000 pounds.\nIII.   Worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario\nThe worse-case scenario would be the release of both our tanks total contents.  Release as a gas over a 10 minute period.

The endpoint from release would be 1.73 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersons to 200 ppm would be .68 miles.\n\nIV.  Accidental release prevention program\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safty Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\nV.  Five-year Accident History\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\nVI.  Emergency responce program\nThe facility has an emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.  Also the facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\nVII.  Planned changes to improve safty\nSafty is a on-going process at our plant.  Evaluations are made daily and are assessed to make sure of the maintance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia recommendations for safety to be implemented at this time."
