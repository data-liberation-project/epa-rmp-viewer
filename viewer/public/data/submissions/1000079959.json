As required by U.S. EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68, the facility's RMP must be fully updated and resubmitted at least once every 5 years.  Since the first renewal was submitted on June 7, 2004, the second renewal was submitted on June 17, 2009, and the third renewal was submitted on June 16, 2014, the 5-year anniversary date for resubmission is set as 5 years from June 16, 2014 or June 16, 2019.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nAK Steel Corporation in Middletown, Ohio complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the spirit and the letter of EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.

AK Steel's safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\r\n\r\nAK Steel's Middletown, Ohio manufacturing facility is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Accidental Release Prevention Provisions (112r) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantity.   Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold and is Program 3.   \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Middletown facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention program rules for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the Middletown facility.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME, ANSI, API, and other industry codes and standards.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia and all identified problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia equipment and operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in an offsite impact of any kind. During the past five years, there have also been no reportable accidents related to the ammonia process at AK Steel Middletown Works resulting in a Section 69.10(b)(1) listed consequence (injury)"
