      "SummaryText": "1.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\r\n\r\nC&S Wholesale Services, Inc. (C&S) requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  C&S's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.  \r\n\r\n2. The facility and the regulated substance handled\r\n\r\nThe facility, operated by C&S, is located at 3925 Highway 190 West in Hammond, Louisiana.  The facility consists of areas for dry, cooler, and freezer storage of perishable and non-perishable items for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe facility has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which exceed the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.  The High Pressure Receivers are the largest vessel for both the Freezer and Perishable refigeration systems and are both located inside the respective machine rooms. Both systems utilize penthouse evaporators, evaporative condensers and associated piping on the roof of each warehouse.\r\n\r\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nBoth processes exceed the ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119, and are therefore subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places them in RMP program 3 level.  C&S uses its PSM program as the required program 3 Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nC&S has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program includes a preventative maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and serviced.  This ensures that the equipment remains in good operating condition and will minimize the probability of accidents due to faulty equipment."

      "SummaryText": "In developing the PSM Program, C&S also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include operation of safety devices.  These procedures are used to train operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration process to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  In addition, refrigeration mechanics receive training through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  These measures ensure that refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Safe work practices such as Lockout/Tagout, Confined Space Entry, and Hot Work Permit are reviewed and updated when necessary to ensure that all non-routine work can be performed safely.  Other components of the prevention program include collection and review of equipment information, the development of Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), and the correction of equipment design deficiencies found.  These actions will ensure that the equipment meets all refrigeration industry standards and that accurate equipment information will be available when needed.  \r\n\r\nThe facility has performed initial and revalidation PHAs of the processes (most recent conducted in 2013).  Other PSM procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Compliance Auditing, and Incident Investigation are also part of the programs to ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The PSM Programs receive full support of facility management and involvement of employees at all levels.\r\n\r\n4. Five-year accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past five years at the facility.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Action Program\r\n\r\nThe Hammond facility has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  In the event of an emergency, evacuation procedures are initiated and the C&S Hazardous Materials Support Team handles releases up to 300 ppm."

      "SummaryText": "The local Fire Department and its Hazardous Materials Response Team will be notified to provide primary support if conditions exceed 300 ppm.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying C&S Corporate Contact who then provides notification to NRC and the Louisiana State Warning Point at 1-(504)925-6595 if appropriate.\r\n\r\n6.Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nRecommendations resulting from the most recent PHA revalidation study identified several items to be completed to improve safety and efficiency at the facility. These recommendations have been assigned to appropriate personnel and are tracked by the corporate compliance team on a quarterly basis."
