      "SummaryText": "Our company only handles one hazardous substance in the amounts requiring special measures as stated in this summary.  For the safety of our facility, we have a training program for each employee consisting of video tapes and on-hand demonstrations.  Each employee must demonstrate his or her knowledge of the safety procedures before being allowed access or handling of the product, and they are tested for their knowledge and, periodically throughout the year, they are spot-checked on site.  Our facility consists of one large metal building with retractable overhead doors at each end and separate heavy metal storage units located approximately 75 feet from the main facility.  The only hazardous product handled at the facility is chlorine gas.  All hazardous material is stored in separate fire-proof, water-proof containers with the appropriate placards as required by O.S.H.A.  All procedures for handling the chemical are done by automated means.  These measures meet or exceed government standards.  We also have the appropriate spill-containment kits within easy access for all trained employees.  Since we do not package or re-package the hazardous chemical at our business, our employees are forbidden to alter the containers in which the chemical comes in any manner.  All our vehicles used for transport of the chlorine gas are inspected and have been approved by the Texas Department of Transportation.  All of our drivers are instructed in the correct way to secure a load and the correct placarding for the chemical.  All drivers are drug-tested through an independent agent.  In case of an accidental release of the chlorine gas, we have the overpacks for containment of any cylinder which may be leaking, and all employees are trained in the use of these overlays.  A)  A chlorine gas leak while in transit would be treated with an overpack for containment, and the driver would immediately notify the closest authorities for hazardous materials.  The driver is equipped with a c"

B)  If a leak should occur at our facility, specific rules would be followed simultaneously by our employees.  One employee would alert the proper authorities, the Wichita County HAZMAT Team, while other employees contain the leaking cylinder with the overpacks.  C)  All employees exit the premises to await the arrival of the HAZMAT Team.  We have never had a chemical release of any amount in the eighteen years we have been in business, but we never relax our caution, treating each cylinder as a possible hazard.  As technology and control equipment improve, we will remain abreast of all available safety measures and will continue to maintain the newest equipment for hazardous materials containment."
