The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of North Central Cooperative, Inc.  are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.
