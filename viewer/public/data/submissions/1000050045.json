ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe management and staff of the Denver Distribution Center are committed to operating their facility with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Denver Distribution Center personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Denver Distribution Center personnel, and the environment, the plant has implemented a management system that integrates the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68.  The policies and procedures integrated under the Denver Distribution Center's management system specifically address prevention of the release of anhydrous ammonia, and an emergency action plan to an accidental release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Denver Distribution Center operates several refrigerated warehouses and a freezer.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the mechanical compression refrigeration system at the facility.  Ammonia is handled in a closed-loop process that consists of the following general stages: liquid storage; expansion; evaporation; compression; and condensation.\n\n\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for dock operations, coolers and freezers.  \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at the Denver Distribution Center which is subject to the EPA RMP rule (and the OSHA PSM standard).  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance handled in the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger.  The Auto Purger removes non-condensables ("

There are four purge points located at the Condenser, and one at the Thermosyphon Receiver.\n\n \n\nThe relief valves are set at 250 psig on all vessels, the compressors, the purger, and the condensers.  The relief valves vent to an Ammonia Dump Tank located outside the equipment room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Denver Distribution Center has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with the OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM), and Federal EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the Denver Distribution Center was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include ammonia sensors throughout the plant, pressure relief valves to protects vessels' integrity, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In the event of ammonia detection, audible and visual alarms are triggered throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition changes that occur within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nD. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nOver the past five years, the Denver Distribution Center has not had any ammonia releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, or offsite evacuations.\n\n\n\nE.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.

If necessary, the facility will call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.\n\n\n\nOther responders will be called as needed, including the Denver Fire Department.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\n\n\nThe Denver Distribution Center will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees in case of an emergency evacuation.  Evacuation drills are performed at least annually.  Other training received by employees includes: ammonia awareness, what to do in case of emergency, and where to go when an evacuation is called. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "
