The Maljamar Gas Plant is a cryogenic\n\nnatural gas processing plant which extracts\n\nhydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.\n\nThree raw   natural  gas  streams  (Low-Pressure\n\nSystem,  Intermediate pressure  System,  and High-\n\npressure System)  are  delivered  via pipeline  to\n\nthe  plant.  After extraction of the hydrocarbon\n\nliquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as\n\nproduct.   The site consists of inlet gas separation,\n\ndehydration, cryogenic gas processing, compression,\n\nand product sto"

Products are transported from\n\nthe facility via pipeline.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  EPA's Risk  Management\n\nProgram  (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the\n\nMaljamar Gas Plant's  inventory of chemicals  was\n\nevaluated  to  determine  if  any  regulated\n\nflammable  or  toxic  substances  were  on  the\n\nplant  site   in quantities  above  the  threshold\n\nquantities.   [Note:  The term \"threshold quantity\"\n\nis the quantity above which the EPA has decided that\n\nthe substance will be regulated.]  Our  evaluation\n\ndetermined  that  the following listed flammable\n\nsubstances  are handled   by  the  plant  in\n\nquantities  above  the  substance's threshold\n\nquantity: ethane/propane/butane/condensate (EPBC)\n\nmix, condensate,  and  propane.   [Note:  condensate\n\nis exempt from threshold determination based on its\n\nNational fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of\n\n3.]  There are no toxic substances above the\n\nthreshold quantity at the plant. Based on worst-case\n\nanalyses of the regulated substances, the distances\n\nto endpoints (i.e.  an overpressure of 1 psi) include\n\none  offsite  receptor (ConocoPhillips Production\n\nOffice). In addition, the Maljamar Gas Plant has not\n\nhad an accidental release in the past five years and\n\nemergency response procedures have been coordinated\n\nwith community response organizations. Therefore, the\n\nMaljamar Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3\n\nprocess under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP)\n\nProgram.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe Maljamar Gas Plant does not have any toxic\n\nsubstances above threshold quantity.  As the plant\n\ndoes not have any toxic substances, toxic release\n\nscenarios were not addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires the operator to model the\n\nworst case release scenario, which the regulations\n\ndefine as the \"release of the largest quantity of a\n\nregulated substance from a vessel or process line\n\nfailure.
