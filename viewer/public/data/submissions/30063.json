[Note:  The term threshold quantity\r\nis the quantity above which the EPA has decided that\r\nthe substance will be regulated.]  Our  evaluation\r\ndetermined  that  the following listed flammable\r\nsubstances  are handled   by  the  plant  in\r\nquantities  above  the  substance's threshold\r\nquantity: ethane/propane/butane/condensate (EPBC)\r\nmix, condensate,  and  propane.

The Maljamar Gas Plant is a cryogenic\r\nnatural gas processing plant which extracts\r\nhydrocarbon liquids from raw natural gas streams.\r\nThree raw   natural  gas  streams  (Low-Pressure\r\nSystem,  Intermediate pressure  System,  and High-\r\npressure System)  are  delivered  via pipeline  to\r\nthe  plant.  After extraction of the hydrocarbon\r\nliquids, residue gas and these liquids are sold as\r\nproduct.   The site consists of inlet gas separation,\r\ndehydration, cryogenic gas processing, compression,\r\nand product sto"

EPBC mix was used in the model for the\r\nhypothetical worst-case flammable scenario. The worst-\r\ncase scenario was modeled on the assumption of the\r\ninstantaneous release of all of the EPBC mix in the\r\nlargest EPBC mix  vessel.   Under the stipulated\r\nguidelines, this hypothetical release, if ignited,\r\nwould have an off-site impact, as determined by the\r\nuse of the OCA Guidance.  [Note: The OCA Guidance is\r\nEPA's Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance\r\ndocument.]\r\nPassive  mitigation  systems  were not  applied\r\nbecause  of  the assumption  for  the  scenario that\r\nthe entire  contents  of  the vessel  be\r\ninstantaneously released.  We believe that a vessel\r\nfailure such as this is extremely unlikely because\r\nthe vessels are   carefully designed with significant\r\nengineering safety factors.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  all pressure vessels are carefully\r\ninspected  and pressure  tested  before  they are\r\nplaced  in  service,  and  the Maljamar  Gas  Plant\r\nfollows  a  rigorous  Mechanical  Integrity Program\r\nto  ensure  that  all  process  equipment  is\r\nproperly maintained and inspected, to prevent leakage\r\nor failure.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBased  on  the  criteria in 40 CFR 68.10,  the\r\ndistance  to  the specified endpoint for the worst-\r\ncase accidental release scenario for  the following\r\nprocesses is greater than the distance to  the\r\nnearest   public  receptor  (ConocoPhillips\r\nProduction  Office): propane  and EPBC mix.  Within\r\nthe past five years, the processes have had no\r\naccidental releases that caused off-site impacts as\r\ndefined in the risk management program rule (40 CFR\r\n68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to\r\nprevent off-site impacts from accidental releases.\r\nIn the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a\r\nregulated substance from the processes"
