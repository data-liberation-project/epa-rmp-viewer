The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from wet natural gas that is gathered from gas producers in the area.  The Plant consists of separate cryogenic processing trains and compressors driven by internal combustion engines.  Once at the plant, the incoming natural gas is sent through a separation and compression process, through a molecular sieve for dehydration and then on to the cryogenic skids where natural gas liquids are separated from the gas stream.  The residue gas leaves the facility via pipeline while the remaining natural gas liquids (NGL's) are stored in a series of pressurized bullet tanks.  The NGLs leave the plant via tank trucks at the present time, with pipeline transfer planned for the future.  As a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Plant at any one time.  Although there are plans to add additional processing trains and equipment, the actual inventory within the Plant should not change significantly.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe followin"

The Tolar Gas Plant has been classified as a Program 3 because public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program and are also subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  \n\n1)  EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant\u00bfs PSM and accidental release prevention programs.  These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n2)  PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on an ongoing basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).

For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n3)  PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHAs.  Plant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team make"

All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4)  OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n1. Unit startup\n2. Normal operations\n3. Temporary operations\n4. Emergency shutdown\n5. Normal shutdown\n6. Initial startup of a new process\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nIn addition, the Tolar Gas Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper or lower limits.  This information along with operating procedures is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n5)  TRAINING\n\nTo complement th"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years and can be satisfied through the review and certification of operating procedures.  All of the training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n6)  CONTRACTORS\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\n\n1. Perform their work in a safe manner\n2. Have the appropriate knowledge and skills\n3. Are aware of the hazards in their workplace\n4. Understand what they should do in the event of an emergency\n5. Understand and follow site safety rules\n6. Inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with:\n\n1.

Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n7)  PRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n8)  MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pump and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include:\n\n1. Conducting training\n2. Developing written procedures\n3. Performing inspections and tests\n4. Correcting identified deficiencies\n5. Applying quality assurance measures\n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on:\n\n1.

The Tolar Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repair.  This helps to ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n9)  HOT WORK PERMITS\n\nA Hot Work Permit Policy has been instituted at the Tolar Gas Plant to protect personnel and the public from potentially explosive atmospheres when conducting hot work activities such as welding, cutting, grinding, and running portable equipment.  Elements of the Hot Work Policy include the training of personnel, safe work practices, atmospheric testing/monitoring, and the issuance of a Hot Work Permit by trained and qualified personnel. \n\n10)  MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes to be properly review and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to:\n\n1. Ensure adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause(s) and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n12)  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Tolar Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\nIn addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in thes"

      "SummaryText": "e procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant process or other Tolar Gas Plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel on the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan for the Tolar Gas Plant is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC is responsible for preparing the community\u00bfs emergency response plan. The Tolar Gas Plant is included in the county\u00bfs emergency response plan under response to oil fire, gas plants, and substations. The Tolar Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n13)  COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Tolar Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are scheduled at least every 3 years.  Audit findings are forwarded to Tolar Gas Plant management for resolution.  The plant management initiates any corrective actions taken in response to the audit and tracks them until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe MEG Tolar Gas Plant has experienced NO reportable process accidents in the past 5 years.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBecause the Tolar Gas Plant is essentially a new facility, there are numerous plans in place to implement and improve safety and environmental programs.
