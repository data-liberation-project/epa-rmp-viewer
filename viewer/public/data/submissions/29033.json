      "SummaryText": "Inergy, L.P. acquired the North Coles Levee Fractionator on October 1, 2003.  Control of this facility is now under Inergy, L.P.  The facility operations are regulated by Title 8 CCR 5189 Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This is a RMP/CalARP Program Level 3 facility.  The facility has implemented the prevention program described below.\n\nThe facility processes, stores, and transfers natural gas, natural gasoline, propane, and butane.  Additionally, liquid propane, butane, and natural gasoline as liquids are extracted from a natural gas stream.  There are 32 tanks with capacities ranging from 4,000 to 44,000 gallons, and one refrigerated tank with a capacity of 5,000,000 gallons.  The worst-case flammable scenario is based upon a release of 5,000,000 gallons.\n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator (NCLF) operates 24-hours a day receiving natural gas liquids (?NGL?S?) from surrounding production fields.  Then NGL?s are recovered from this natural gas through a refrigeration process.  Afterwards, the remaining natural gas is sold to different utility companies for home use.  Finally, the NGL?s are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses.  This facility has the ability to remove hazardous hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming NCLF deliveries.  In the summer, the facility receives and stores truck deliveries of liquid propane, to be used as winter fuel in a five million gallon refrigerated propane tank.\n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator has recently been modernized through the addition of computer controls, additional storage, 6 bay loading/unloading racks and completion of all 1999 Process Hazard Analysis recommendations.  In addition, all storage and loading piping and transfer control devices were replaced.  The facility design standards for the moderniz"

Fire protection upgrades are compliant with the California Fire Code ? 1997 and Kern County Fire Department.  The fire protection system is new and includes pumps, fire monitors, fire hydrants, loading rack deluge, LEL detectors, and UV/IR fire detection systems.  \n\nThe prevention program is based on the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735 and includes the following: Offsite Consequence Analysis, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. \n\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the Process Safety Management and RMP/CalARP programs, emergency response, hot work permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures. \n \nPlanned changes to improve safety have been established based with the process safety management audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis. \n\nInergy, L.P. maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.

The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4, this facility has not had an accidental release.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department ? Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario were based on propane as the modeled substance.  The worst-case release of 24,394,500 lbs of liquefied petroleum gas and indicates a one-psi overpressure distance of 2.35 miles.  This distance impacts pubic receptors of an oil production facility, natural gasoline plant, an adjacent farm, and a resident population of 75.  Although there are numerous controls in place, no allowance for passive mitigation was made in calculating the worst-case scenario.  This scenario is based upon the US EPA Vapor Cloud Explosion Methodology (TNT Equivalency Method).  This same release scenario was also evaluated using the Baker-Strehlow VCE Model.  This method takes into account the flatness of the surrounding terrain and the fact that the propane is stored in a refrigerated tank at minus 44 degrees Fahrenheit.  Results of the Baker-Strehlow VE Model indicate a one-psi overpressure distance of 0.02 miles.  Even though the Baker-Strehlow VCE Model results are also conservative and recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, at this time Inergy, L.P. has elected to submit the RMP program using the more conservative EPA TNT Equivalency Methodology.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this process is a break in transfer hose connection.  This scenario could result in a release of 60 lbs of liquids over a ten-minute period.  The maximum distance of this scenario is 0.03 miles.  \n\nThe process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shut off valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.

This walkthrough was comprised of a visual inspection of the above grade process piping and vessels. The references used for the 1999 walkthrough were the following: \n\nAPI Standard 570 Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration.\n\nProcesses Unlimited International, Inc., Engineered Safety Section, CalARP Seismic Assessment Procedure, April 12, 1999.\n\nUniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials.\n\nPlanned changes to improve the seismic safety of the facility were incorporated into the Process Hazard Analysis.  The planned changes and PHA recommendations were incorporated into the 2001 facility modernization and upgrade.\n\nThe design standards employed during the modernization included conformance to the most current design and operating standards, such as Uniform Building Code 1997, as well as other standards noted above.\n\nThe seismic walkthrough determined that based on the document Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada: Uniform Building Code 1997, this facility resides outside the boundaries and contours of a Near Source Fault Zone.\n\nInergy, L.P. has a commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements already in place.  Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as modernization of transfer operations, piping upgrades, training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installation is an investment in good business practices.  Inergy?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release."
