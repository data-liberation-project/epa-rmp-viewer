(MarkWest), owner and operator of the Bluestone Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Bluestone Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove water.  The gas is then sent through refrigeration dew point control units where the condensable liquids are extracted from the methane gas stream.  The remaining methane (residue stream) gas is transported offsite via pipeline. The separated liquids (C2+) can be sent to one of several pressurized storage tanks awaiting truck or rail loadout, or can be further processed to remove ethane as a separate purity product. Once ethane is removed through the de-ethanization process, it is transported offsite via pipeline. The remaining liquids (C3+) can be sent to one of several pressurized storage tanks awaiting truck or rail loadout, or it can be further processed to remove propane as a separate purity product. Once propane is removed through the de-propanization process, it is sent to pressurized storage prior to being loaded out by truck or rail. The remaining liquids (C4+) are sent to one of several pressurized storage tanks awaiting truck or rail loadout.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case accident scenario was determined by looking at several scenarios and determining which would have the greates"

The following four scenarios were evaluated: (1) the release of the entire contents of an 80,000 gal pressurized propane storage tank; (2) the release of the entire contents of an 84,000 gal pressurized butane-natural gasoline mix (C4+) storage tank; (3) the release of the entire contents of a 60,000 gal pressurized NGL (C2+) storage tank; and (4) the release of the entire contents of a 60,000 gal pressurized NGL (C3+) storage tank. The worst-case release was chosen to be from the 80,000 gal pressurized propane storage tank.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario was considered to be the rupturing of an unloading hose during propane transfer operations.  To be conservative it was assumed the flow would be unabated for five minutes until the valves could shut and flow ceased.  At a flow of 200 gallons/minute this would cause the release of approximately 1,000 gallons of propane.  Using the typical concentrations and specific gravity of products this amounts to a release of 4,879 pounds of a regulated substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered processes at the facility. Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Bluestone Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews"

      "SummaryText": "(PSSRs)\r\n\r\nMarkWest conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The PSSR confirm that construction was completed in accordance with design specifications, that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.  The PSSR will be reviewed and appropriately updated during the management of change process.  The PSSR will ensure that: modifications were installed as described; no other changes were made outside the original scope of work; operating procedures have been modified and communicated to operating and maintenance personnel; all necessary tests have been completed prior to start-up; all site safety, fire protection, and environmental issues have been addressed; the startup plan has been reviewed; pertinent drawing have been red-lined or updated to as-built requirements; vendor files have been updated; and training of affected personnel has been performed and documented.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, MarkWest periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  Team membership will include at least one person knowledgeable of the system being audited.  One member of the team must be qualified to lead the audit and be familiar with the auditing protocol being administered.  Audits will be conducted using the OSHA Verification Checklist CPL2-2.45a and the EPA Audit Guidance Checklist.  The Plant Compliance Coordinator will maintain a listing of all non-conformances identified during an audit and document closure of compliance audit action items.  The two most recent audit reports will remain on file with the documentation of closed items.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation"

      "SummaryText": "MarkWest promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, determine what error states led to the incident and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team consists of the immediate supervisor, one person knowledgeable in the process, and other members with appropriate experience to investigate and analyze the incident.  The team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions that are identified will be promptly addressed, resolved and tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) whose job tasks are relevant to the investigation.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nMarkWest encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard anyalsis (PHA) team.  Employees will be provided with all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nMarkWest uses a hot work permit for hot work operations including grinding, welding, and spark producing activities conducted on or near a covered process.

Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Bluestone Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Bluestone Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Bluestone Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
