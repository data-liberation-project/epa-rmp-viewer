Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n The management and the employees of the Wilmington  plant of Royster - Clark, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia at the Wilmington facility. If any accidental release should occur at the facility, personnel are prepared to work with the New Hanover County LEPC and the New Hanover Station 5 Fire Department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulatory substance handled;\n\nThe primary activity at the Wilmington facility of Royster - Clark, Inc., is the manufacture of fertilizer for sale to the agriculture user (farmer).\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, generally by Railroad Tank Cars or occasionally by tanker trucks, stored, and used from the storage tank in the manufacture of mixed-grade fertilizers for plant nutrients.\nThe maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored at this facility would be 368,000 pounds (130,000 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank filled to 80% capacity, which is a facility policy, 78,000 pounds in a 18,000 gallon storage tank, filled to 80% and 160,000 pounds contained in a loaded Rail Tank Car). This maximum storage would only happen in rare circumstance.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario;\n\na. The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the contents of Anhydrous Ammonia from a fully loaded Railroad Tank Car released as a gas in a ten minute period. The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 160,000 pounds, which is the capacity of the Railroad cars.The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia, as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's model - Degadis, is 1.22 miles. This release would  affect 100  residents and some commercial, office and industrial areas.The possibility of this Worst-Case Scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as the Railroad"

The Alternate Release Scenario based on the most likely potential incident, is a release of Anhydrous Ammonia from a break in a 2\" transfer hose , during the unloading procedure, with the release discontinued in 2 minutes. The calculated quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia released would be 11,900 pounds.  The distance to an end point of 200 ppm of ammonia as determined by The Fertilizer Institute's model Degadis is 0.56 miles. This release would  affect 10 residentsand some commercial, office and industrial areas. The possibility of this Alternate Release Scenario occurring is extremely unlikely as Wilmington  personnel periodically inspect, repair, and replace involved equipment according to standard procedures.\n\n4. The General Accidental release Prevention Program;\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof  Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute, Inc.; The standard of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard.  \n\n5.
