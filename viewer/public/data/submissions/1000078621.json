Colonial Terminals, Inc. is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The plant injects butane into gasoline to alter the octane rating. The butane is unloaded from 180,000 lb. railcars and blended into the atmospheric gasoline storage tanks. The butane unloading process is subject to EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations as well as\r\nOSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nColonial Terminals, Inc recently installed additional butane unloading.  As per the RMP requirements, the facility is required to update its RMP Plan according to 40 CFR 68.190.  This submittal includes the updated inventory of butane located at the facility (the maximum inventory is based on storage of 4 railcars) and updated Program Level 3 Prevention Program data.  Below are brief descriptions of other required executive summary elements as specified in 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\nThe site's accidental release prevention program was developed in accordance with the RMP and PSM regulatory requirements and includes all of the required elements. Chemical-specific prevention steps for butane include:\r\n-\tUpgraded process equipment\r\n-\tIncreased the number of LEL detection sensors from 4 to 7\r\n-\tImproved technology of LEL sensors (IR vs. catalytic bead)\r\n-\tInterlock of Emergency Shut down with response of LEL sensors\r\n-\tAdded remote visibility of LEL conditions and alarms\r\n \r\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Integrated Contingency Plan. The Integrated Contingency Plan identifies response capabilities and complies with requirements of OSHA, EPA, USCG, and Georgia EPD. The plan is reviewed annually. There have been no RMP reportable accidental releases from the facility in the past five (5) years. The most recent PHA included several recommendations that have resulted"
