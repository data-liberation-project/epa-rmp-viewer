In addition, it is Company policy for site personnel to participate in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  A copy of the emergency response plan is offered to the fire department and LEPC.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nThrough our ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program, the Company looks continuously for possible system changes to improve our operations.

The incident investigation and report will be processed through the electronic management system.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Company believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Facility employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\nThere was a chlorine release on 7/26/2021 when the heat exchanger failed.  When personnel pulled a vacuum to stop the flow of chlorine to the heat exchanger, water was drawn into a ton on the system and 3 fuse plugs failed. There were no onsite or offsite injuries resulting from this incident; however, there was significant onsite property damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan\r\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  Records of the PSSR shall be maintained in the electronic management system.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Company conducts an audit at the facility using an audit template which serves as the verification sheet providing the auditors with the necessary information to expedite the review of the program and ensure all requirements of the standards are met.
