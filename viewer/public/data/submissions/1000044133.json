      "SummaryText": "Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, L.L.C., Marietta, Ohio\n\nEPA Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Solvay Specialty Polymers USA L.L.C., Marietta, Ohio plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our plant adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant is located at 17005 State Route 7, P.O. Box 446, Marietta, Ohio.  Various chemicals are processed to produce engineering polymers which are used in medical, electronic, automotive, and food service application.  The regulated substance at the plant in excess of the threshold quantity is methyl chloride.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for methyl chloride, a toxic gas liquefied by pressure, is a gaseous release of 26,650 pounds of pure methyl chloride in ten minutes (1470 lbs. /min, release occurs in an enclosed space in direct contact with air).  The WCS is the loss of the entire contents of the larger of two methyl chloride storage tanks (C-151) and is based on an endpoint concentration identified by emergency response planning guide level 2 (ERPG-2) with a value of 0.82 mg/L.  The distance to end point (1.3 miles) was calculated for the WCS using the methodology outline in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance using the RMP*Comp online tool.  The assumptions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/second "

Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for methyl chloride, a toxic gas liquefied by pressure, is a gaseous release of 340 pounds of pure methyl chloride in three minutes (113.3 lbs./min) from the holding tanks pressure relief device (release occurs in an enclosed space in direct contact with air). This release scenario is based on an endpoint concentration identified by emergency response planning guide level 2 (ERPG-2) with a value of 0.82 mg/L.  The distance to end point (< 0.1 miles) was calculated for the alternative release scenario using the methodology outline in EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance using the RMP*Comp online tool.  The assumptions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/second with atmospheric stability class \"D\" and air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.

In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and personal safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operation, maintenance, engineering, and plant management\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Each process has documentation available showing the location of this information to help employees and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant primarily uses the hazard and operability with Layers of Protection Analysis (HAZOP/LOPA) techniques to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe HAZOP team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Solvay plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to work starting.
