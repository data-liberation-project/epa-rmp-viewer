The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, MFA Exchange and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in Chamois are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Chamois Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 56,078 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker truck which typically holds 50,000 pounds.  The facility also has an 8,000 gallon storage tank which holds 37,386 pounds.  The facility has 15 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 65,025 pounds.  There are also two 400 gallon and one 560 gallon applicators that would hold approximately\n5,896 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 164,385 pounds.  \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n\n\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum qua"

A second alternate release scenario is based on the total release of a 1,000 gallon nurse tank.  The total contents of the tank would be released in approximately 2 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 4,400 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .27 miles.  \n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia that \n    occurred at this facility on 7/13/2000. The release was\n    caused by a piece of heavy equipment running into process\n    lines to the railcar receiving site. The release lasted\n    approximately 20 minutes with approximately 7,748 pound of \n    product lost. The Chamois Fire Department was called and \n    assisted with controlling the release and in the evacuation\n    of approximately 50 residents. There were 3 persons treated\n    for minor injuries.\n\n     There was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia that \n     occurred at this facility on 8/21/02.  The release was \n    caused by two men attempting to steal anhydrous ammonia \n    from a nurse tank.  They opened the nurse tank valve and \n    left the area.  The release lasted approximately 30 minutes\n    with approximately 1,040 pounds of product lost.  The    \n     Chamois Fire Department was called and assisted with \n     controlling the release and in the evacuation of  \n     approximately 15 residents.  No people were treated for \n     injuries.  \n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The fac"
