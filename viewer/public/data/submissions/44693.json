Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCalifornia Chemical of Santa Barbara County (also CCSB) stores and repackages chlorine, which is considered a hazardous material that is a regulated substance and is considered in this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.  CCSB has posted Emergency Response Procedures at the site and in the office, which includes procedures for reporting any hazardous chemical accident or release and the emergency contact telephone numbers.  CCSB has also posted its Emergency Medical and First Aid Response Procedures, which is a quick reference for employees and office personnel on what to do if a person is exposed to chlorine gas, as well as its Emergency Escape Mask Procedures, which details how to use the emergency escape mask in the event of an accidental  release.  All CCSB service vehicles contain Emergency Response Documents, which is a quick reference for employees on what to do in various potential emergency and/or release situations.  CCSB also has an emergency action plan contained in section N of the OSHA PSM. \n\nCCSB's Emergency Action Plan is contained within its PSM.  Employees will respond only to incidental releases and emergency responders will be called for emergencies.  When filling cylinders with chlorine, employees have available safety goggles, gloves and escape masks.  Employees test the System using ammonia for leak detection prior to filling the system with chlorine from the ton container.  A chlorine sensor alarm wi"

A posted Emergency Response Program identifies who to call in the event of a release, which includes calling 911.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCCSB provides chlorination service to residential swimming pools.  Chlorine is repackaged at the facility from a one-ton container to twenty pound net capacity service cylinders.  The twenty pound cylinders are used by the facility's service staff to chlorinate customer swimming pools in accordance with the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.  The facility operates five days a week (M-F), eight hours per day, and 50 weeks per year.\n\nThe Fill Yard is used exclusively for the storage and repackaging of chlorine.  The yard area provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of chlorine delivery vehicles during the off-loading of full one-ton containers and the loading of empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe Fill Yard is not exposed to vehicular traffic.  The Fill Yard houses all of the chlorine containers and is surrounded by a fence with barbed wire.  The area is locked after normal working hours.  The only ton stored on site is sealed inside a secondary containment vessel with an 18 bolt lock, and chlorine sensor alarm with 24 hour monitoring.  Company policy does not allow unauthorized personnel entry into the building.  Signs are posted indicating a poison gas on site.  Container handling and storage is per local, state and federal regulations.\n\nThe amount of chlorine packaged per month is seasonally dependent.  The summer months, for obvious reasons, are the busiest swim times of the year.  Consequently, the quantity of chlorine on site is highest during this period. CCC stores a maximum of 2,400 pounds of chlorine.  This amount includes the contents of 1 one-ton container and 20 twenty-pound cylinders. \n\nChlorine is purchased from and delivered by a commercial chlorine supplier.  Delivery of one-ton containers is during"

The one-ton container is stored and used in the Fill Yard inside a secondary containment vessel, which is a passive mitigation factor for any worst case release scenario.\n\nOff-loading of the one-ton containers from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a lift gate.  The one-ton container is placed on iron rollers/rails and is rolled into the secondary containment vessel in the Fill Yard, where it is sealed and bolted behind 18 bolts.  Empty and full twenty pound cylinders are segregated and are chained into place in an upright position.  The company limits the amount of chlorine at the facility to no more than 1 one-ton container and 20 each twenty pound cylinders for a total of 2,400 pounds.  The procedure, in part, requires the owner/operator to verify existing chlorine inventory to ensure that an order and delivery of a one-ton container will not cause the aggregate quantity to exceed 2,400 pounds.\n\nChlorine is repackaged as a liquid from one-ton containers into twenty pound net-capacity, DOT approved cylinders.  Any residual chlorine is directed into a liquid caustic absorption scrubber.  The twenty pound cylinders are transported by company service vehicles to customer's swimming pools where the service personnel dispense the chlorine as a gas into the pool.  The twenty pound cylinders are owned by the company and maintenance is performed in accordance with the maintenance procedures in the PSM.  \n\nThe receipt, storage, and repackaging of chlorine is considered a single process.  The major components of the chlorine system are:  the one-ton DOT aproved cylinders, the secondary containment vessel for the ton, the proprietary transfer piping assembly, the twenty pound capacity DOT approved cylinders, the pan scale for weighing the cylinders during the filling operation, and the chlorine absorption system.\n\nA proprietary tube assembly is attached to a valve on the operating one-ton container and an empty service cylinder is b"

Filling commences by opening the one-ton container liquid valve, the cylinder valve, and various other proprietary and confidential steps in the transfer assembly.  After filling, which is indicated by weight on the pan scale reaching the desired value, the cylinder valve is closed, the ton supply of chlorine is closed, and the transfer tubing is evacuated into the chlorine absorption system prior to disconnecting the full service cylinder.  The caustic solution comprising the absorption medium is prevented from being sucked back into the system using the unique design of the proprietary and confidential chlorine packaging system.  \n\nThe packaging system is operated under pressure from the chlorine container.  Only a small amount of residual chlorine remains in the lines after fill to be routed to the caustic scrubber.  Operational and test procedures are in place which ensure that the scrubber system is operating correctly.  Chlorine is not vented to the atmosphere.  Full twenty pound cylinders are stored in the packaging area until loaded onto delivery trucks.  Transport and loading of the cylinders adheres to DOT and other regulations.\n\nFilling is done by trained, qualified personnel.  Written filling procedures exist and are followed.

The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equipment represents the facility's main active commitment to an accidental release prevention program. \n\nCCSB has a maintenance program for equipment, including rebuilding the valves on the fill system.

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon alerting personnel at the facility to evacutate the facility and await the arrival of local emergency responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  Use of CCSB's total containment vessel results in an end-point distance and affected ground surface area for the worst case scenario for the RMP that are reduced significantly from the unmitigated worst case scenario included in this RMP.  In addition, the use of the vessel will reduce significantly the end-point distance and affected ground surface area for the alternative release scenarios included in this RMP as detailed in the off-site consequence analysis.  CCSB's Emergency Response Plan is posted at the fill yard and in the office as a quick reference for how to handle an emergency.  \n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCCSB"
