Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nWe at Sysco Las Vegas, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Unforseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the North Las Vegas Fire Department, who provides our on-site emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 17,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the Clean Air Act.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to the EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\n\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in en"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process.\r\n\r\nTraining:\r\n\r\nSysco Las Vegas, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently if needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:\r\n\r\nSysco Las Vegas, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Process equipment examined by these checks include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Sysco Las Vegas, Inc. to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nSysco Las Vegas, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions required by the RMP regulation are being implemented.  These audits are completed at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nSysco Las Vegas, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).  These investigations are conducted to identify the circumstances leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release or near-miss from recurring.  All accident/incident reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\n\r\nSysco Las Vegas, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.  Company employees and contractors are urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements for the ammonia refrigeration system.
