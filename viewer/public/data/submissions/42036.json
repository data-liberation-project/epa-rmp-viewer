P.O. box 557, Kersey Co. 80631 (970) 353-2567\n\nRMP Executive Summary  \n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nThe owner, management and employees of Centennial Ag. Supply of Greeley Co. are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. If an accidental release should occure, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\na)The facility has been owned and operated by Centennial Ag. Supply since 1976. All details and information concerning the plan are based on activities since that date.\n\nb)The primary activity of this facility as it relates to anhydrous ammonia is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for the manufacturing of liquid fertilizers for sale and distribution to growers for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nc)The maximum quanity stored in the largest storage tank is approximately 130,000 pounds. This represents filling the storage tank to 85% of capacity. There is one large storage tank on site. Anhydrous ammonia is shipped to the facility by bulk truck.\n\n3.The worst case and alternate release scenarios\n\na)The worst case scenario is based on the entire contents of the storage tank being released over a ten minute period. The quanity release would equal approximately 130,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which represents the volume of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\nb)The alternate case scenario is based on a release caused by a break in a transfer hose. The quanity released would equal approximately 26,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion at 200ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n4.The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\na)This Facility has implemen"
