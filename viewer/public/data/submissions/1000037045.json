      "SummaryText": "Sargento Foods, Inc., in Hilbert, Wisconsin is a dairy processing plant with modern capabilities. The facility was constructed in 1979. A building addition completed in 2008 included the facilities first ammonia refrigeration system. The facility occupies about 120,000 square feet, and is situated on a 24.4-acre parcel of land. The property is located in a predominantly rural area, on the southern outskirts of the Village of Hilbert. Adjacent properties to the west, east and south are farmland. Residential properties are located to the north.\n\n\n\nSargento Foods is committed to protecting the health and well being of their employees, the environment, and the community. Employee training programs are in place, including ammonia awareness training for all employees, annual emergency response training for the response teams and ammonia system training for the maintenance personnel. The facility has a chemical labeling program and a spill prevention plan. Outside contractors must follow written contractor policies. Hot work permits are required. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and installed in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code SPS Chapter 343 and ASTM standards. The system is a basic two-stage mechanical refrigeration system utilizing ammonia as the refrigerant. The facility is equipped with alarm and ammonia detection systems, which continually monitor the refrigeration system. Also, Sargento maintenance employees make daily inspections.\n\n\n\nSargento Foods has never had an accident involving the ammonia system that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage or sheltering in place. If an emergency were to occur, the local fire and hazardous response team would be notified and the emergency response procedures would be followed. Sargento Foods Hilbert also has retained Bassett Mechanical (Kaukauna, Wisconsin) to respond to a release or emergency situation. The facility has an Emergency Action Plan, and employees have been tr"

      "SummaryText": "ained how to use the plan. Emergency drills are carried out several times each year. The response teams are invited to visit the facility on a regular basis.  The facility has several Facility Emergency Coordinators on each shift, who have been trained in Emergency Action Plan procedures and in coordination with outside response personnel. Training and maintenance schedules are handled promptly and efficiently through the use of computer software.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Sargento Foods?Hilbert facility is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) which requires the facility to manage system operations and develop emergency response and accident prevention programs. Sargento Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program for the Hilbert facility, in conjunction with the addition of ammonia to the facility. The PSM will be audited every three years. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) will be conducted every five years, or when a major change is made to the ammonia system. The last PHA was conducted in November 2008, as part of equipment modifications The PHA showed that the facility appears to have an adequate number of safeguards and implied that the facility was safe.
