The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook.  The worst case release scenarios are highly unlikely to occur because of active and passive mitigation measures that are available and used, and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled for the CalARP/EPA RMP Program 2 anhydrous ammonia.  The meteorological conditions specified by Sacramento County and consistent with regulatory requirements for alternative release scenarios were used.  SLAB was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst case scenario.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment Tab in the Compliance Workbook. \n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and facility personnel that make this worst case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\nIn addition to the use of conse"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  As ammonia is \u00c2\u00bfself alarming\u00c2\u00bf due to its pungent odor, even minor releases are readily noticeable.\n  \nThe Prevention Program 2 elements applied to the process include:\n\u00c2\u00bfSafety Information\n\u00c2\u00bfHazard Review\n\u00c2\u00bfOperating Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bfTraining\n\u00c2\u00bfMaintenance\n\u00c2\u00bfCompliance Audits\n\u00c2\u00bfIncident Investigation\n\u00c2\u00bfEmergency Response\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no CalARP/EPA RMP applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan filed with the Sacramento County Environmental Management Department and this plan includes:\n\u00c2\u00bfReporting Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bfEvacuation Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bfEmergency Alarm Procedures\n\u00c2\u00bfSafety and Health Considerations\n\u00c2\u00bfEmployee Alarm System\n\u00c2\u00bfTraining\n\u00c2\u00bfReview of Emergency Action Plan\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at the facility.

The facility is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility staff is highly trained and utilizes log sheets and employee rounds to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long standing commitment to its workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system.  The facility\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable standard operating procedures and maintenance tasks to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used at the facility for blending into mixed grade fertilizers.
