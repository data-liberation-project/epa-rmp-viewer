All KRG facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner.  It shall be the responsibility of the General Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, it is KRG policy to immediately call the local fire departemnt and assist the agency.\n\nIt is also KRG's belief and policy to work openly with all local, state, and federal agencies for the betterment of the community and the industry.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nKern Ridge Growers, LLC (Lamont), is a grower, packer, processor, and shipper located at 8005 Wharton Avenue, Lamont, California, that uses Anhydrous Ammonia in a closed loop refrigerating system and gaseous Chlorine.  The Chlorine in stored onsite with two, one ton tanks charging the Fresh Production with Chlorine gas.  The gas is mixed with water and acts as a sanitizer.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\nFor this document, three (3) separate Ammonia release scenarios are used:  the \"Worst Case\" as required by law and two \"Alternative Release\" (most likely).  The Worst Case release scenario was based on the high pressure reciever completely filled and losing its entire charge.\n\nThe first Alternative Release scenario is considered to be a leaking pipe containing high pressure gaseous ammonia.  This scenario was chosen because the majority of ammonia releases nationwide are attibuted to this.  Our second scenario, although less likely, features the failure of a liquid low-pressure ammonia vessel developing a leak.  This scenario was chosen to highlight the need for regular inspections of equipment normally overlooked at other facilities.\n\nTwo separate chlorine releases were chosen.  Our worst-case scenario involves the loss of an entire cylinder over a ten minut"

The alternative scenario was chosen because it is the only release that could possibly occur according to our chlorine maintenance contractor.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program:\nOur ammonia system is thoroughly inspected on an annual basis utilizing a format that is recognized industry-wide and is based on manufacturers' recommendations.  Our entire chlorine system is inspected weekly by our chlorine maintenance contractor.  All of our operators have received the appropriate training to operate either system safely and effectively to prevent releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThe last five years have been accident free.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nWe have instituted several emergency action plans that are specific to the nature and scope of any potential problem that may arise.  These plans contain troubleshooting, evacuation, first aid, and notification provedures.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\nOur intention is to continue our tradition of offering ongoing training to our operators, upkeep of our written programs, and to continue with our mechanical integrity program."
