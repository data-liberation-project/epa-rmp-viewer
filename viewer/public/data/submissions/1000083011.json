      "SummaryText": "Arena Propane RMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\nFacility and Product Description\n\n\n\nThe Andersons Arena Facility receives bulk shipments and re-loads distribution trucks with propane.  This facility implemented this process in the Fall of 2019.  The facility is situated in an agricultural setting and is located approximately 3 miles west of the town of Arena, Wisconsin, Arena Township, Iowa County.\n\n\n\nNearby Water Bodies:\n\n\n\nDrainage ditch ? mile to the South flows west to Wisconsin river 2.5 miles.\n\n\n\nSurrounding Occupancies to Land Use:\n\n\n\nNorth:  Farmland to 1 mile, Wisconsin River 1 ? miles\n\nSouth:  Drainage ditch ? mile, farmland to 1 mile, State Hwy 14 and residential to 1 mile\n\nEast:  Farmland to 1 mile, rural residential 1 mile to 1 1/4 miles\n\nWest:  Farmland to ? mile, rural residential ? mile to 1 mile\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical:\n\n\n\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is propane.  Propane is an extremely flammable colorless gas and can travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back to the leak.  It can displace oxygen in the air, causing suffocation.  Direct addition of water to liquefied propane gas will cause flash vaporization resulting in an explosion (either immediately or delayed) known as a \"boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE)\".  Heat from fire can cause a rapid build-up of pressure inside cylinder tanks.  Explosive rupture and a sudden release of large amounts of gas may result.  This condition may cause the cylinder tanks to rocket.  Direct contact with the liquefied propane can chill or freeze the skin (frostbite).\n\n\n\nPropane is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.  Propane is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  Two 60,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of propane.  The tanks are located on the south east side of the facility adjacent to the Wisconsin Southern Rail tracks including a railroad spur.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, each tank can hold 51,000 gallons of li"

Distribution of the propane utilizes external trucking companies which have 24/7 access to the system.  Facility employees are only present during scheduled work hours.\n\n\n\nSummary of Major Hazards\n\n\n\nThe principal causes of propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario.  The most probable time for a release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery rail car to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the bulk storage tanks to the delivery trucks.  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be inspected, maintained, and connected properly to control releases of propane.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All bulk storage tank loading transfers of propane are observed by facility personnel.  Facility employees only observe transfers from the bulk storage tanks to delivery trucks during scheduled work hours.\n\n\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the propane inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open to reduce the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will re-seal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration a few seconds at the most.\n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst-case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The propane tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME and other appropriate pressure vessel code.  All welding and structural work done on the tank and the associated piping system was performed by certified welders.\n\n\n\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented\n\n\n\nIf a rail car were to move or pull away before being properly disconnected  the following protection is in place:\n\n\n\n1.    Each rail-car has 3 Emergency Shuto"

In an emergency, the pneumatically controlled rail-car ESVs can be employed to the \"closed\" position by activating any of the 3  Emergency Shutoff Stations located throughout the facility or by manually disconnecting the air chucks at the ESVs.\n\n\n\n2.    Each of the 3 rail arms have shutdown protection. The 2 liquid arms employ a back check valve and the vapor arm employs an ESV.\n\n\n\n3.

They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They will not reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose, a broken pipe, or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a truck pull-away the following protection is in place:\n\n\n\n1.    The disconnection of the SCULLY grounding cable will shut down the meter skid. (Control valve and pumps)\n\n\n\n2.    The truck loading bulkhead hose couplings have cables attached to the meter skid ESV which will close the flow of propane. \n\n\n\n3.

The tank pressure reliefs open and vent directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure. The hydrostatic relief valves open and vent directly to atmosphere at 460 psi and are installed between shutoff valves in liquid piping.\n\n\n\nThree (3)  Emergency shut-off stations  are located within the terminal. Activation of any / all of these emergency shutdown stations will shut down all pneumatically operated internal valves and ESVs within the facility regardless of the operation(s) being performed.   This stops the flow of propane by remote activation of the terminal pneumatic system which is regulated by an air compressor located in the equipment enclosure (drivers building).  \n\n\n\nOther safety items and actions include the following.  Wind sock is located on the south east corner of the propane tanks on a pole.  Third party security monitoring system provides motion detection after hours.  Facility personnel and / or truck drivers supervise all propane to and from the bulk storage tanks.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nPreventive maintenance (PM) is an integral piece of this hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and piping are inspected at least monthly and documented using a PM database.  All hose and valve replacements are documented in the PM database.  Records of major maintenance tasks performed on the tank or related equipment are saved in the PM database.\n\n \n\nTraining\n\n\n\nEmployees receive training on propane safety, the Emergency Action Plan (EAP), and Hazard Communication Program.

The Corporate Safety Department performs hazard management audits at the facility.  The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA / OSHA / DOT paperwork and training documentation.  Action items are noted and recommendations are made.  The audits consist of five major topical areas:  Safety & Health, Environmental, Fire Protection & Security, Administrative and Housekeeping & Storage.
