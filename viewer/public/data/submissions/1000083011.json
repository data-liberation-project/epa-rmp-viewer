The audits consist of five major topical areas:  Safety & Health, Environmental, Fire Protection & Security, Administrative and Housekeeping & Storage. Issues are documented in a report and sent to the facility manager and upper management.

Distribution of the propane utilizes external trucking companies which have 24/7 access to the system.  Facility employees are only present during scheduled work hours.\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards\r\n\r\nThe principal causes of propane emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as indicated by the alternative release scenario.  The most probable time for a release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery rail car to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the bulk storage tanks to the delivery trucks.  Flexible hoses and fixed piping must be inspected, maintained, and connected properly to control releases of propane.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All bulk storage tank loading transfers of propane are observed by facility personnel.  Facility employees only observe transfers from the bulk storage tanks to delivery trucks during scheduled work hours.\r\n\r\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the propane inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause one or more relief valves to open to reduce the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will re-seal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration a few seconds at the most.\r\n\r\nA complete failure or burst tank, as indicated by the worst-case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The propane tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME and other appropriate pressure vessel code.  All welding and structural work done on the tank and the associated piping system was performed by certified welders.\r\n\r\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented\r\n\r\nIf a rail car were to move or pull away before being properly disconnected  the following protection is in place:\r\n\r\n1.\tEach rail-car has 3 Emergency Shuto"

      "SummaryText": "Arena Propane RMP Executive Summary\r\n\r\nFacility and Product Description\r\n\r\nThe Andersons Arena Facility receives bulk shipments and re-loads distribution trucks with propane.  This facility implemented this process in the Fall of 2019.  The facility is situated in an agricultural setting and is located approximately 3 miles west of the town of Arena, Wisconsin, Arena Township, Iowa County.\r\n\r\nNearby Water Bodies:\r\n\r\nDrainage ditch \u00bd mile to the South flows west to Wisconsin river 2.5 miles.\r\n\r\nSurrounding Occupancies to Land Use:\r\n\r\nNorth:  Farmland to 1 mile, Wisconsin River 1 \u00bd miles\r\nSouth:  Drainage ditch \u00bd mile, farmland to 1 mile, State Hwy 14 and residential to 1 mile\r\nEast:  Farmland to 1 mile, rural residential 1 mile to 1 1/4 miles\r\nWest:  Farmland to \u00bd mile, rural residential \u00bd mile to 1 mile\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical:\r\n\r\nThe only RMP-regulated material at this facility is propane.  Propane is an extremely flammable colorless gas and can travel a considerable distance to a source of ignition and flash back to the leak.  It can displace oxygen in the air, causing suffocation.  Direct addition of water to liquefied propane gas will cause flash vaporization resulting in an explosion (either immediately or delayed) known as a boiling liquid, expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).  Heat from fire can cause a rapid build-up of pressure inside cylinder tanks.  Explosive rupture and a sudden release of large amounts of gas may result.  This condition may cause the cylinder tanks to rocket.  Direct contact with the liquefied propane can chill or freeze the skin (frostbite).\r\n\r\nPropane is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.  Propane is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  Two 60,000 gallon tanks are used for bulk storage of propane.  The tanks are located on the south east side of the facility adjacent to the Wisconsin Southern Rail tracks including a railroad spur.  When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, each tank can hold 51,000 gallons of li"
