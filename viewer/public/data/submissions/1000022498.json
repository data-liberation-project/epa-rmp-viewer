      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThis document was originally prepared in May 2006 to demonstrate how Ocean State Power's (OSP's), Harrisville, Rhode Island facility complies with the requirements set forth under EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68).  In May 2011, the Louis Berger Group reviewed and edited this document to insure that all information is accurate and current.  This plan was developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of aqueous ammonia at the OSP facility.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines OSP's design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, OSP has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the Part 68 rules.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the appropriate existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n1.1  Corporate Commitment to Safety\nOcean State Power is committed in providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, OSP's goal is achieving and sustaining zero accident tolerance through communication, information, and training.  To this end, OSP is dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\nThe following principles will guide and measure OSP's corporate goals and objectives in Health, Safety, and Environment:\nA?    Conduct business so it meets or exceeds all applicable laws and regulations and minimizes risk to employees, the public and the environment;\nA?    Commitment to continuously improving Health, Safety and Environment performance;\nA?    Belief that all occupation"

Endeavor to do business with companies and contractors which share OSP's expectations for Health, Safety and Environment performance and commitment and regularly assess their performance; and\nA?    Support open communication between OSP, the public, the scientific community, policy makers and public interest groups who research, develop and implement standards for Health, Safety and Environmental protection.\nThe facility aims to produce electricity as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials wherever and whenever prudent.  In this effort, OSP's highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of toxics during of production.  Where toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\nOcean State Power has an active emergency prevention and response program specifically tailored for the facility.  In addition, Site Emergency Plans incorporate applicable safety and environmental regulations.  It is the responsibility of facility management to carry out these programs.\nThe first duty of OSP employees is to exercise care in the performance of work tasks to prevent an accident to self, co-workers, the public, or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment for all employees at every level of the organization.\n1.2  Facility Description\nOSP is a 560-megawatt (MW) combined cycle gas turbine electric generating facility that is available to produce power 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Figure 1 provides an orthographic photo for the facility site and Figure 2 provides an equipment layout.  The area surrounding the facility is gated and public access is restricted.

No. 2 oil is no longer used or stored at the facility, but OSP retains the permits to allow for use of No. 2 oil in the future.  \nThe facility's power plant consists of two identical phases.  Each phase includes two GE MS7001EA combustion turbine generators, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs)/boilers with supplemental firing using duct burners, and one steam turbine generator.  Auxiliary equipment includes an electrical switchyard, wet mechanical cooling towers, and a zero discharge water treatment system.  Other facility components include selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems; two 150-foot concrete stacks equipped with continuous emissions monitoring systems; two emergency diesel generators; and hydraulic/machine oil and chemical storage.  The plant is operated from the control room.  Operators have access to plant operating data from the computerized distributed control system (DCS) and a central data acquisition and handling system (DAHS).\nAqueous ammonia (29%) is the only regulated substance used in a process in an amount that exceeds the Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold quantity.  Ammonia is used as a reducing agent for the SCR nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions control system for the combustion turbines.  Aqueous ammonia (NH3) is evaporated in hot air and injected into the flue gases upstream of a catalyst located in the heat recovery boilers to convert NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.  The amount of ammonia injected and the NOx/NH3 emissions in the exhaust stack gases are continuously measured and recorded.  The SCR system comprises four subsystems: aqueous ammonia unloading area; an aboveground ammonia storage tank to provide four weeks' capacity; two ammonia transfer pumps (one back-up) to transfer solution to the four ammonia flow control/evaporator units; and four ammonia injection systems (one per HRSG).

There are several interlock functions within the ammonia supply line that can activate an emergency shutoff valve.  Isolation valves and a bypass valve are provided as a contingency, should the ammonia flow control valve have to be taken out of service.  Ammonia leak detection devices are also provided. \nQuantities of all other substances utilized at the facility are less than 112(r) reporting thresholds and are addressed in other reporting statutes such as SARA Title III (EPCRA Tier II reporting), OSHA, etc.\n1.3  Five-Year Accident History\nOSP has had zero accidental releases of aqueous ammonia in the past five years.\n1.4  Emergency Response Program\nOSP maintains an active emergency prevention and response program in accordance with applicable regulations.  This program consists of two primary elements:  Emergency Prevention and Response Plan and an Emergency Response Procedures Handbook.  OSP is prepared to respond to emergencies quickly and effectively.  The primary goal is to protect the health and safety of facility personnel and the public, and to minimize damage to the environment and facility equipment in the unlikely event of an accident.  An Emergency Coordinator/Qualified Individual (EC/QI) is responsible for implementing and overseeing emergency response activities onsite.  If the primary EC is not available, the alternate EC has received adequate training and has been delegated authority.  The facility's Procedures Handbook provides actions for proper notifications within OSP's emergency response organization to activate necessary resources.  OSP has an ongoing employee health and safety training program conducted by qualified instructors.  Facility personnel are trained in functional areas that correspond to their emergency response duties and responsibilities.  Drills are conducted fo"

A full description of the emergency equipment available at the site is provided in the facility's Site Emergency Plans.  Specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release can be found OSP's Site Emergency Plans.  These procedures include immediate notification to authorities, establishing a command and control center, evacuation of personnel, and actions to be taken to stop or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n"
