(hereafter referred to as Trout Blue Chelan) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Trout Blue Chelan to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\r\n\r\n\tTrout Blue Chelan refrigeration personnel do respond to ammonia releases and have received training in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, in addition to training specifically for ammonia.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on this plan.\r\n\r\nAt Trout Blue Chelan anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is considered hazardous by EPA and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  Chemical properties of ammonia make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling ammonia in order to:\r\n\r\n? Prevent unnecessary human exposure\r\n? Reduce the threat to our personnel\r\n? Reduce the threat to the community\r\n\r\n\r\nB.\tFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nTrout Blue Chelan is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located near the city of Chelan, county of Chelan, state of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance used at Trout Blue Chelan is anhydrous ammonia \r\n(CAS # 7664-41-7). The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant.\r\n\r\nThere is approximately 28,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the system.\r\n\r\nTrout Blue Chelan uses other hazardous substances on-site, however they do not meet or exceed the thresh"

      "SummaryText": "old limits established in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, Trout Blue Chelan believes in the concept set forth in the \u00bfGeneral Duty Clause\u00bf of the Clean Air Act.  To this effect, Trout Blue Chelan has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.\tWorst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenarios identified as \u00bfworst case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative\u00bf scenarios.  The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \u00bfthe owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \u00bf\u00bf.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst case scenario\u00bf.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario - Failure of the largest vessel would release 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room; its walls are in direct contact with the outside, however the effects of building mitigation were not considered.  \r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic end-point of 0.14 mg/L is 1.8 mile.  The \u00bfrisk radius\u00bf extends past the boundaries of the plant, into public receptor areas. Distance was determined by use of RMP-COMP.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Several alternative scenarios were modeled, using ALOHA\u00bf,  however a release from the bottom (liquid space) of the receiver, under normal operating conditions, was chosen.  This alternative scenario provided the greatest risk radius of 1,100 yards.  There was no building mitigation used for this scenario.  It was, however, assumed that the safeties and computer control would limit the release to the amount in the receiver.\r\n\r\nBoth the \u00bfworst-case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative\u00bf scenarios are unlikely due to the safeties on the system such as temperature and pressure cutouts, computer controls and pressure relief valves to prevent an overpressure situation.\r\n\r\nA more rea"

Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Trout Blue Chelan has established Emergency Response Guidelines for releases involving ammonia.  These procedures are part of the ongoing training.\r\n\r\nTrout Blue Chelan coordinates its response efforts with Chelan County Fire District 7,  Chelan Co. Sheriff\u00bfs Office, Lake Chelan Valley Hospital EMS,  Chelan Co. Emergency Management Department in Wenatchee and the Washington State Patrol.\r\nG. Planned Safety Improvements\r\n\r\nPlanned safety improvements are, 1)  Install emergency shutdowns on the outside wall of all engine rooms,   2)   Increase training to personnel ( both refrigeration and fork lift operators ),   3)  Review and update the emergency plan yearly and provide semi-annual drills and training in the emergency ( evacuation ) plan to all plant personnel  4) Renumber and paint the engine room numbers in standard locations on all engine rooms to improve response time and avoid confusion."

In scenarios modeled for this type of an event, the risk radius was reduced to approximately 250 yards.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTrout Blue Chelan\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n? Initial and continued training of personnel\r\n? Preventative maintenance programs as described in the PSM\r\n? Use of safety equipment and procedures\r\n? Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\r\nTrout Blue Chelan complies with:\r\n\r\n? OSHA\u00bfs and Washington State\u00bfs process safety management rules.\r\n? Washington State\u00bfs safety regulations.\r\n? And as revisions are made to the system applicable IIAR (International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration) standards for good work practice are implemented.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected; compressor (engine) room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems Trout Blue Chelan utilizes include:\r\n\r\n? Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\r\n? Suction trap hi-level float\r\n? Ammonia Sensors in every engine room\r\n? High discharge pressure shut down\r\n? Low suction pressure shut down\r\n? High discharge temperature shut down\r\n? Oil pressure failure shut down\r\n? High amperes shut down\r\n? Automatic timer to prevent short cycling via computer controls\r\n? Oil filters plugged shut down\r\n? 250 psi relief valves on high pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\r\n? 150 psi relief valves on low pressure side, to prevent overpressure situations\r\nOperating Procedures and checklists have been prepared by Trout Blue Chelan to be used by employees performing operational functions. Procedures are kept in the refrigeration office.  These procedures includ"
