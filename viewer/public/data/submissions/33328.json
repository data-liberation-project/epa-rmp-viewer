To achieve this end, PXP strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \n\nPXP implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public.  The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue, and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n1.2\tFacility Description\n\nThe Inglewood Field is located at 5640 South Fairfax Ave in metropolitan Los Angeles, seven miles west-southwest of downtown Los Angeles.  The field covers most of the Baldwin Hills.  These hills project above the surrounding coastal plain by 300-400 feet.  The Field is located in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County, except for a small northwest portion which lies within Culver City.  \n\nThe gas plant is situated near the north end of the Field.  The Field is bordered in this area by the Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area. The nearest public roadway, La Cienega Boulevard, runs through the middle of the Inglewood Field in a north-south direction.  A map of the area is shown in Appendix E.\nThe Kenneth Hahn State Recreational Area is approximately 900 feet (.17 mile) to the north.  The State Recreation Area is considered a public receptor under the RMP regulation.  There are no designated environm"

A public school is located 3,600 feet (0.68 mile) to the northwest of the gas plant which is outside the 1 psi overpressure limit (0.4 mile) for the worst case scenario.  The nearest residences are outside the 1psi limit.\n\nThe gas plant is designed to convert sweet field gas into pipeline quality sales gas and natural gas liquids (natural gas liquids and propane).  A diethanolamine (DEA) unit removes excess CO2 and trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide from the gas prior to shipping.\n\nThe Inglewood Gas Plant was previously owned by Stocker Resources, Inc. It was purchased by PXP on September 18, 2002.\n\n\n1.2.1  System Process Summary\n\nMajor process steps include the following:\n\na) First stage compression and dewatering (1.3 psig to 36.3 psig);\nb) Second stage compression and dewatering (36.3 psig to 150 psig);\nc) Third stage compression and dewatering (150 psig to 475 psig);\nd) DEA CO2 removal and odor control;\ne) NGL separation, storage, and shipping (LTS Unit); and\nf) Safety relief (PSVs, vents, and flare). \n\nTwo LPG bullets each have a working capacity of 22,500 gallons.  The natural gas liquids (NGL) storage tank has a working capacity of 20,000 gallons.\n1.3\tRegulated Substances\n\nThe California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) regulations apply to a stationary source with a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The two regulated substances of concern at PXP Inglewood Gas Plant are liguefied propane gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (NGLs).  The CalARP threshold quantity and the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) threshold for these substances is 10,000 lbs.    \n\nThere are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities (10,000 lbs. or more) under the regulation. \n\nThe following flammable substances are present over the threshold quantity: \n\n? Propane CAS # 74-98-6 (189,000 lbs. \u00bf based on 75% working capacity and including NGLs)\n\nUnder Title 19 Divisi"

Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), PXP has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 Prevention Program.  \n\nThe objective of the CalARP Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the process.  Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation: 1) the process design; 2) process technology; 3) process changes; 4) operational and maintenance activities and procedures; 5) non-routine activities and procedures; 6) emergency preparedness plans and procedures; 7) training programs; and 8) other elements that affect the process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.  PXP uses the proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation for prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures, or equipment.  The elements of the PXP\u00bfs accidental release prevention program are summarized as follows:\n\nProcess Safety Information \u00bf This includes complete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment essential to the company\u00bfs PSM program and to a process hazard analysis.

The PHA provides information that will assist the company and its employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases of flammable or toxic materials.  The PHA has been updated and can be found in Appendix J.  \n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf As part of the PSM program, all procedures for operating and maintaining the process equipment are documented and accessible to employees whose work involves this equipment.  As needed, changes or updates to the processing system operating procedures are incorporated under the company\u00bfs management of change program.\n\nEmployee Training \u00bf Personnel performing specific tasks, which affect the processing system, must be qualified to perform their assigned tasks.  The company utilizes an established training program that ensures the training and competency of employees, whose jobs require them to perform work, which affect the processing system. \n\nMechanical Integrity \u00bf Under the PSM program, equipment used to process, store, or handle flammable or toxic materials has to be designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the release of such chemicals.  As required, elements of the mechanical integrity program include identifying and categorizing equipment and instrumentation as faulty or potentially faulty, inspections and tests and their frequency; maintenance procedures; training of maintenance personnel; criteria for acceptable test results; and documentation of manufacturer recommendations for equipment and instrumentation.\n\nManagement of Change \u00bf Contemplated changes to a process must be evaluated thoroughly to fully assess their impact on employee safety and health and to determine needed changes"

The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for \u00bfreplacements in kind\u00bf) to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the existing manufacturing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review \u00bf As one of the requirements of CalARP/RMP, PXP is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  A PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes that require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.  For existing processes that have been shutdown for turnaround or modification, company policy ensures that any changes other than \u00bfreplacement in kind\u00bf made to the process during shutdown go through the management of change process.    \n\nCompliance Audits \u00bf Periodically, PXP performs an audit of their RMP program as required by the CalARP standard.  An audit is a technique used to gather sufficient facts and information, including statistical information, to verify compliance with the CalARP standards.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions and practices to verify that the program elements are effectively implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation \u00bf A crucial part of PXP\u00bfs program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented.  Accordingly, PXP has an incident investigation program that requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable or toxic material.\n\nEmployee Participation Plan \u00bf PXP has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation, and management of these program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices"
