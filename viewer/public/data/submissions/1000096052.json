      "SummaryText": "AmeriGas Columbia Terminal - Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe AmeriGas Columbia terminal is a propane storage and distribution facility. The facility includes ten (10) above-ground storage tanks. Each Tank has 30,000 Gallons Water Capacity W.C each. Three (3) of the tanks are for butane service and the other seven (7) are for propane service. The maximum quantity of product in pounds that we can store on site of propane is 747,094 pounds and butane is 372,387 pounds. There are six (6) Compressors used to unload the rails cars. The terminal has a siding with eight (8) rail towers designed to hook to rail cars and unload product to storage tanks using a system of Compressors. Compressors withdraw propane vapors from the storage tank and compress them or increase their pressure and discharge into the rail cars to be unloaded. This process slightly decreases the pressure in the bulk storage tanks and increases the pressure in the rail cars. As a result, liquid propane flows from rail car to the bulk storage tanks. \n\n\n\nThe terminal has four (4) Liquid Pumps and four (4) bulkheads. Using the loading pumps, transports are loaded at the terminal, when required. There are also five (5) Plant Wide Emergency Shutdown Buttons, three (3) electrical system shutdown buttons, and twelve (12) individual system pneumatic shutdown buttons that are strategically located throughout the terminal that are used to power off the electrical equipment including pumps, compressors and air compressors, pneumatically charged Emergency Shutdown Valves (ESVs) and internal valve. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\n\n\nThe same properties that make propane valuable as a fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent leaks, spills and accidents. First and foremost, in our operations, efforts are undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as to minimize the risk of exposure to the surrounding communiti"

      "SummaryText": "es. It is our company policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. The Facility has Terminal Operations Supervisor who is able to immediately assist with a serious incident by contacting the emergency responders. AmeriGas also maintains an around the clock Emergency Communications Center (ECC), which handles all after-hours and emergency calls from around the country. The ECC has the ability to contact AmeriGas field personnel, as well as Chemtrec, on any type of incident encountered at any AmeriGas location or by AmeriGas customers. \n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario that was considered was catastrophic release of propane from a 30,000 Gallons Tank. Using EPA RMP Comp, the calculated worst case distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.4 milesRMP Comp was used as a tool to calculate distance to endpoints of 1 psi over pressure. RMP Comp assumes meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario of atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per hour). Ambient air temperature assumed is 25 C (77 deg F). TNT-equivalent model is used which assumes a yield factor of 10 percent. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nFor alternative release scenario, release from transfer hoses at the facility was considered. The active mitigation devices were assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. Using equation from Appendix C1 (EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis), the calculated distance to 1 psi over pressure end point for vapor cloud explosion is 0.03 miles. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations. This is a non-responding facility.Emergencies that require assistance from the local emergency response organizations"

The employees are trained on their responsibilities in an emergency to ensure prompt response. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility has no plans at the present time to make any changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
