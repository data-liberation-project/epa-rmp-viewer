The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9000:2000 certified facility employs 108 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\n\nIn March of 1999 GCOR initiated an effort to enhance the existing management system for the site.  This effort was guided by sustainable development principles and incorporated equity, environmental and economic drivers into the site?s management system.  We feel that this ?people/plant/profit? approach to our everyday business is a sound basis for the pursuit of long-term business viability while taking responsibility for improving the environmental, social, and economic conditions resulting from our activities.  Site goals and on-going initiatives are tracked through yearly measures, which are issued through Danisco?s annual Sustainability Report.  Danisco?s last Sustainability Report can be found at www.danisco.com/sustainability.\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility?s enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-shift maintenance and laboratory support.  Staff support includes site management, environmental health and safety, engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Average on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 37,000 liters, equal to 21,887 p"

Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including computer controls, automation, containment of all outdoor tanks and indoor sump areas, and on-site air scrubbing and neutralization capabilities.\n\nThe site?s management team is committed to the implementation of site environmental health and safety programs and supports the following.\n\nThe environmental health and safety budget is established to provide:\nAppropriate and adequate personal protective equipment\nAppropriate and post-offer and annual medical examinations\nTraining\nAir monitoring equipment and analysis\nHazardous waste pick-up for a conditionally exempt small quantity hazardous waste generator\nEmergency response team equipment and supplies\n\nA site Safety Committee is in place to foster the plant?s overall safety performance.  The Committee?s activities are as follows.\nCharter:\nThe Safety Committee will be proactive in reviewing and clarifying safety policies for the overall safety of the plant.\nMission Statement:\nThe mission of the Safety Committee is to promote a safe work environment by leading the way in demonstrating safety principles.  Safety is everyone?s responsibility, and individual follow-through is expected.  This team is not the safety police.\n2009 Goals:\nAll regular full-time employees complete supplemental SafeStart training within one year of start-date.\nIncrease the number of near-miss reports from the previous year.\n\nThe GCOR, Cedar Rapids Site EH&S Policy lends guidance to site efforts.\n\nCedar Rapids EH&S P"

Through innovation and collaboration we will protect the environment, promote the well being of our employees and the world community.  In the spirit of this intent, we will organize our work activities to improve continually in EHS management, performance and pollution prevention.  We will meet legal and internal requirements, prevent pollution and preserve resources.  We are committed to the prevention of injury and ill health of our employees, and we will use their input to improve our performance.  We understand that the long-term viability and progress of our business depends on us continuing to take responsibility for improving the environmental, social and economic conditions resulting from our commercial activities.\n\nNew employees attend approximately 14 hours of initial safety training, which includes chemical awareness training as well as various OSHA and EPA required information.  Job duty training is ongoing for each employee and occurs with co-worker trainers utilizing on the job observation and partnering, SOPs, training assessments, and computer based training programs.  GCOR believes in being proactive in its training endeavors and strives to encourage employees to attend specific training associated with their job duties that goes above and beyond basic job requirements.\n\nCapital projects deemed necessary for environmental health and safety reasons are implemented and supported through the capital expenditure process.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe site Emergency Action Plan addresses how employees shall respond to emergencies, including hazardous weather, fire, medical, building evacuation, hazardous device threat, utility failure, and hazardous material spills.  All employees are trained in the site Emergency action Plan as part of the established initial safety training for new employees.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan also introduc"

The ERT members are trained in Industrial Incipient Level Fire Brigade, Technical Level Industrial Chemical Spill Response, First Aid/Adult CPR, Automatic External Defibrillator, and Blood borne Pathogens.  On-going yearly goals include: complete one drill per crew by designated quarter, complete three table-top scenarios, and have injury free responses to all incidents.\n\nThis group trains yearly as well as conducts drills and tabletop scenarios to prepare for incident handling.  On-site ERT equipment is maintained to support the ERT efforts and includes SCBAs, Level B chemical resistant suits, chemical absorbent materials, pumps and hoses, and an equipment trailer for timely response to an incident.\n\nThe site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release is in place to provide ERT guidance for spill operations.  The Incident Command System is the designated management system for emergencies and is included in the plan.  The plan outlines the responsibility of involved personnel during an incident, discusses the Incident Command System, gives instruction for securing outside emergency assistance, addresses internal and external notifications including the media and public, outlines emergency procedures for general emergency response, addresses spill control/personal protective equipment/first aid, and covers disposal and decontamination.  All ERT members are trained in the site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release.  Incident response checklists and incident report forms are used by the GCOR Incident Commander and involved personnel during incidents.  The site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release is shared with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nGeneral Prevention Measures\n\nGCOR has a number of measures in place for spill prevention.

The facility also operates under ISO 9000:2000 certification which ensures among other things that procedures are updated and used for plant operations in addition to proper handling of all documents.\n\nThe presence of an Emergency Response Team ensures that all safety and environmental events are addressed immediately to prevent the escalation of the incident if possible.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at GCOR involving the ammonium hydroxide system that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of an on-going safety review, a Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for the site ammonium hydroxide system in January of 2009.  The was led by an experienced outside consultant and completed with a team of GCOR members representing Logistics (process), Fermentation (process), Maintenance, Engineering, and Environmental Health and Safety.  Four recommendations for investigation and improvement were generated from the Process Hazard Analysis.  The action items were completed by the end of January 2009."
