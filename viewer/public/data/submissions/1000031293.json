This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason the Betances Filtration Plant has undergone some engineering controls changes.  These changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nBetances Cabo Rojo Filtration Plant is located close to the area where the plants supply the potable water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers and cylinders of 150 pounds. The containers are connected to chlorinators from which the chlorine flows to the injectors and then the chlorinated water is sent to different injections points along the process of the plant. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plant, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlor"

Standard Operational Procedures SOP's are already in place to comply the OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOP\u00bfs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA has various SOP's to manage emergency programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.\r\n\r\nFive years Accident History:\r\nNo mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten (10) pounds has been reported during the last five years. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nPRASA has already implemented in Betances Cabo Rojo Filtration Plant, a vacuum operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage.  \r\n\r\nAudits:\r\nThe last compliance audit was conducted on August 21, 2012.
