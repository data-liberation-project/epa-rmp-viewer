The plant processes about 40,000 gallons of LPG per day.The hydrocabons that are recovered are sold as a specification propane,butane and condensate. Total combined storage for processed liquid is 205,920 gallons.\r\n    LPG is trucked into our facility from other gas processing plants that have processed the gas to the point that water and some of the ethane has been removed. From that point Penn Oaks seperates the propane,butane, and condensate. There are no toxic or extremely hazardous chemicals in this process.\r\n\r\n        General Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical-specific steps:  \r\n\r\n    The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate mechanical and electrical codes for Gas Processing plants and is subject to OSHA's PSM program. Written programs and procedures cover all of the key elements to the PSM program. Employees are well trained in the safe opreation of the facility.This facility does not require an air emmision permit, but follows to the best of our knowledge all other requirements of local,state, and federal agencies. This plant is also equipped with Emergency Shutdown Devices (ESD) that will shut down process including all storage tank internal valves, which close all piping ports.\r\n       \r\n         Chemical-specific steps include:\r\n\r\n     1. Hydrocarbon detectors that will shut down process if calibrated ppm's are reached.\r\n     2. Process safety relief valves.\r\n     3. Automated plant shutdown system. The plant will automaticall shut down if certain key process parameters vary from specified ranges.\r\n     4. Manual valves to permit isolation of various portions of the process.\r\n     5. Appropriately placed portable fire extinguishers to combat incipient stage fires.\r\n     6. Plant ESD's\r\n\r\n\r\n         Five year Accident History:"
