Fort Benning is located in western Georgia, along the Chattahoochee River, near Columbus, GA. The installation extends westward into Alabama south of Phenix City, Alabama. The installation is situated on approximately 180,000+ acres, which includes parts of Muscogee and Chattahoochee counties in Georgia and Russell County in Alabama. There are four main cantonment areas at the installation: Main Post, Harmony Church, Kelley Hill, and Sand Hill.\n     The facility uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at its wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plant. The capacities of the chlorine gas cylinder containers are either 2,000 lbs or 150 lbs. The specific amount stored at each process is found with the program elements.\n     Several of the swimming pools onpost used to disinfect with chlorine gas. However, all the pools have been converted to the tablet form of chlorine.       \n     Fort Benning has not had any accidents involving chlorine gas in any off-site or on-site impacts in the past five years. Information about the off-site consequence analysis is included in the program elements.\n     In the event of a chlorine release, Fort Benning?s wastewater treatment plants and water treatment plant employees do not act as first responders. There is a written policy (with training) to inform Fort Benning Fire Department through the use of 911. Fort Benning has arranged for the fire department to respond to emergencies involving chlorine. Fort Benning?s fire department is equipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to the magnitude in which chlorine is stored. Fort Benning complies with all fire codes and all applicable state and federal laws.\n     Fort Benning has reduced the amount of chlorine gas stored at Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 from 12,000 lbs to 6000 lbs. Wastewater Treatment Plant #2 has reduced the amoun"

Thus, any breaks in the lines will cause the system to shut down and prevent chlorine gas from escaping.
