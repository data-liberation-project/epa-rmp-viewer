There have been no accidental releases in the past five years.  \r\n5.\tEmergency Response Plan\r\nThe Greensboro DC has a written emergency plan for ammonia in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.   Emergency plans are coordinated with local responders.  \r\nRefrigeration operators are trained in ammonia emergency response and the Publix program complies with paragraph (q) of 29 CFR 1910.120.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 or contacting the State Warning Point at 1-800-858-0368.  Although Publix maintains response capabilities, the facility is considered non-responding and works with local responders in the event of an emergency involving ammonia.  \r\n6.\tPlans to Improve Safety\r\nTo improve safety, Publix plans to have local responders involved in annual training exercises and ammonia release drills as the facility begins operation.  Publix continues to monitor industry regulations to enhance safe operation of the process."

The program implemented at Greensboro mirrors programs in place at other Publix ammonia refrigerated facilities.  \r\nIn developing the PSM program, the Greensboro facility also developed written operating procedures for the refrigeration process.  These procedures cover all phases of operation and include information on safety devices.  The procedures are used to train all operators and mechanics who work on the ammonia refrigeration processes to ensure consistency of operation and minimize human error.  These measures also ensure that refrigeration operators and mechanics are properly trained.  Publix has also implemented safe work practices and procedures such as line breaking, lockout/tagout and hot work permitting to ensure that non-routine work can be performed safely.  \r\nOther components of the prevention program include collection and periodic review of all equipment information, including Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).  The staff ensures that if equipment design deficiencies are identified that they are corrected.  These actions will ensure that equipment meets refrigeration industry standards and equipment information will be available when needed.  \r\nTo ensure that Greensboro DC's refrigeration staff has the skill necessary to identify unsafe conditions, they are included in a refrigeration training program and receive support from refrigeration staff in Lakeland, Florida.  Training includes Process Hazard Analyses, Process Hazard Analyses, Operating Procedures, Maintenance Procedures, Emergency Response, and Safe Work Practices.  A Process Hazard Analysis was performed in February 2022, prior to startup.\r\nAdditional procedures, including Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Review, Compliance Audits and Incident Investigation, also ensure the continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.

      "SummaryText": "1.\t Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Publix) Greensboro Distribution Center (GRBDC) is located at 5566 Burlington Road, McLeansville, North Carolina,  Guilford County.  Publix requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  A site PSM Coordinator is appointed to facilitate compliance.  Publix's corporate and division environmental and safety personnel provide assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement for the safety and training services.  \r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Greensboro DC is located on Burlington Road and consists of areas for dry, frozen and cooler storage of non-perishable and perishable items for distribution to Publix Super Markets.  To provide cooling to these areas, the facility will use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in quantities above 10,000 pounds.  The refrigeration vessels and compressors are located within a dedicated machinery room; emergency relief is to a water dilution tank.  Refrigeration piping is outside of the building and ammonia detection is provided in rooftop air units with automatic shutdown for units on detection.  \r\n3.\tPrevention Program\r\nThe facility exceeds the ammonia threshold quantity (TQ) for OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119, and the process is therefore subject to PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the refrigeration process in the Program 3 level.  The facility will use its PSM program as the required Program 3 Prevention Program.  \r\nThe Greensboro DC has a program in place to comply with the OSHA PSM Standard.  It includes a preventive maintenance plan which requires all ammonia refrigeration equipment to be periodically inspected and services.  This helps to ensure that all e"
