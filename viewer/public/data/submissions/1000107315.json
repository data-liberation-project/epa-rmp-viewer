The thermal oxidizers are very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\nThe facility also has a water cooling tower for non-contact cooling water. Cooling is needed in distillation and fermentation. \n\nThe facility is protected from fire with a high pressure fire water loop and sprinklers in high risk areas.   Also there is a central fire detection and alarm system. \n\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\nThe chemical that requires participation in the Risk Management Plan is natural gasoline. Natural gasoline is used to denature the ethanol.  Natural gasoline is a flammable mixture.  There are multiple constituents of natural gasoline however, based on analysis, four of those constituents, butane, pentane, isobutane, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane are subject to the Risk Management Plan.  Butane makes up 15% of the natural gasoline, pentane makes up 20%, isobutane makes up 9.5%, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane makes up 23%.\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a 235,000 gallon steel tank in the facility's tank farm.  Secondary containment consisting of compacted clay surrounds the tank farm.\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release\n\nNatural Gasoline:\nThe worst case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The storage tank capacity is 235,000 gallons or just under 1.3 million pounds.  Of the 1.3 million pounds, about 880,000 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\nAlternative Release\n\nNatural Gasoline:\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Deliveries are made by railcar and pumped into the storage tank.  Deliveries are typically 30,000 gallons or 166,000 pounds of which about 110,000 pounds are RMP materials.\n\nUnloading of denaturant railcars occurs during business hours and is o"

The facility is located in Cass County, Clinton Township. The site is north of State road 25 and west of County Road 325 west. \n\nThe Clymers facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 60 people.  The following operations are performed at this facility:  grain receiving and storage; hammer milling; fermentation; distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE); Corn oil extraction. Stillage and syrup is dried to produce DDGs (Dried Distillers Grain with soluble). The finished products are wet and dry distillers grain (WDGS / DDGS), corn oil, denatured ethanol, and E85 ethanol.  These products are shipped out via trucks and rail.\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the pre-existing grain elevator or the new secondary truck dump at the ethanol plant.  Grain is stored temporarily in the concrete silos or steel grain bins, prior to being fed to hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\nThe corn flour is mixed with water, enzymes, and yeast; then is fermented to produce ethanol beer.  The gases produced in fermentation are scrubbed with water to remove VOCs and then discharged to atmosphere. The beer is distilled to produce 190 proof ethanol and whole stillage. The 190 proof ethanol is dried to 200 proof and is denatured with natural gasoline to produce denatured ethanol and E85 ethanol finished products.
