Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Vopak USA Inc. (Vopak) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVopak is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Founded in 1924, Vopak supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings, public utilities and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVopak is an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the blending, repackaging, bulk and warehouse storage of chemicals, and their distribution to local industries via Vopak's fleet of delivery trucks.  One of the products stored and handled at our facility, ammonium hydroxide, is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This product is delivered to our facility by common carrier truck in sealed, UN Specification containers and stored in our warehouse until distributed to end-use customers.  We warehouse ammonium hydroxide in its original factory-packaged sealed containers, and do not open, use or repackage the material in any way prior to sale.  We mus"

With regard to ammonium hydroxide, the maximum quantity expected to be in inventory at any time is approximately 161,000 pounds, which is equivalent to 390 - 55 gallon containers.  A key requirement of EPA's RMP rule is the preparation and submission of a Risk Management Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nThe EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) software was used for modeling purposes.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for a Program 2 toxic regulated substance involves a catastrophic release from the largest single container in storage.  In this scenario, 384 pounds of ammonium hydroxide (Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater)(  is released from a 55-gallon container.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures, while present at the facility, were not used to calculate the scenario.  At class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonium hydroxide involves a release of one-half the contents of a shipping container.  The scenario involves the release of 187 pounds from a 55-gallon container either damaged i"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonium hydroxide (Ammonia (conc. 20% or greater)( is (0.1 miles.  \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the general release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nVopak maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA was performed on 05/16/2001.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activi"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nVopak has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at various intervals between one and three years depending on the subject matter.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nVopak carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others, forklifts, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Vopak to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 08/09/2001.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Vopak.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and mainten"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nVopak promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nVopak truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as apart of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Vopak has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps undertaken at our facility include the following:\n|    Maintaining minimal inventory\n|    Developing Standard Operating Procedures on safe handling of the material and reviewing\nannually to ensure they are maintained current and up-to-dat"

Five-year Accident History\n\nVopak has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, comprehensive operating procedures and frequent training, there have been no accidental releases of ammonium hydroxide.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nVopak carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nOur emergency plan has been coordinated and verified with the Phoenix Fire Department, which is the primary local emergency response agency, as well as with the Maricopa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Updates to this plan are distributed to appropriate local emergency response organizations.  Additionally, joint training and practice drills with the Phoenix Fire Department have been conducted, as well as annual site visits by the fire department to ensure they remain familiar with our site.\n\n7.
