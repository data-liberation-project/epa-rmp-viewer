Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Owensboro Specialty Polymers, LLC (OSP) are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of various latex polymers, NAICS code 325211 (formerly Standard Industrial Classification (\"SIC\") Code 2821).  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile], Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate and Vinylidene Chloride are used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymers.\n\nThe total quantities handled/stored for each regulated substance, used for determination of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), are - Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 33,603 lb., Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] is 407,100 lb., and Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is 139,939 lb.  A summary description of each of the production processes is set forth below. \n\n1.    Polyvinylidene Chloride (DARAN)\n\na.    Process Description: Emulsion polymerizations of 1,1-Dichloroethylene with other monomers such as acrylonitrile and various acrylates.   Polyvinylidene Chloride emulsions are high barrier, flexible, crystalline polymers designed for coating paper, paperboard, plastic films and metal.  Polyvinylidene Chloride is made"

Some examples of the process safety information include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all raw materials and products, Equipment Specification Sheets, and Process Instrumentation and Design drawings (P&ID).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not greater than five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11-6-2007\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Owensboro Specialty Polymers maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.
