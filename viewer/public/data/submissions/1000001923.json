This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of various latex polymers, NAICS code 325211 (formerly Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 2821).  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile], Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-].  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Acrylonitrile, Vinyl Acetate and Vinylidene Chloride are used for manufacturing liquid latex emulsion polymers.\n\nThe total quantities handled/stored for each regulated substance, used for determination of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), are - Vinyl acetate monomer [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] is 33,603 lb., Vinylidene chloride [Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-] is 407,100 lb., and Acrylonitrile  [2-Propenenitrile] is 139,939 lb.  A summary description of each of the production processes is set forth below. \n\n1.\tPolyvinylidene Chloride (DARAN)\n\na.\tProcess Description: Emulsion polymerizations of 1,1-Dichloroethylene with other monomers such as acrylonitrile and various acrylates.   Polyvinylidene Chloride emulsions are high barrier, flexible, crystalline polymers designed for coating paper, paperboard, plastic films and metal.  Polyvinylidene Chloride is made"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some examples of the process safety information include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) on all raw materials and products, Equipment Specification Sheets, and Process Instrumentation and Design drawings (P&ID).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of not greater than five (5) years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11-6-2007\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Owensboro Specialty Polymers maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOwensboro Speci"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Owensboro Specialty Polymers to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 10-24-2008.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Owensboro Specialty Polymers.  The most recent review was performed on 06/4/2004.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nOwensboro Specialty Polymers conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
