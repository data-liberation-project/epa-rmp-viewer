Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n \nHill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHA PSM.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, Hill Brothers Chemical Company will contact the Phoenix Fire Department to respond."

The Phoenix plant maintains a highly cooperative relationship with the Phoenix Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of the processes and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility stores, repackages, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also manufactures bleach and stores and distributes chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders to customers.  The Phoenix operations relating to this RMP are described briefly below.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Fill \u00bf Anhydrous ammonia liquefied under pressure is received at the facility in large containers and repackaged into smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.  Until delivery, the repackaged ammonia is stored at this process area.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage \u00bf Anhydrous ammonia is received at the facility in large containers and transferred into an on-site storage container.  This material is transferred to smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.\n\nChlorine Fill/Bleach \u00bf Chlorine liquefied under pressure is received and stored on-site in railcars.  The chlorine is transferred to smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.  Chlorine is also used to make bleach solution, which is then packaged and delivered to customers.\n\nChlorine in Warehouse \u00bf The smaller chlorine containers that are filled on site are stored in the warehouse until they are delivered to customers.\n\nSulfur Dioxide in Warehouse \u00bf The Phoenix Facility receives sulfur dioxide liquefied under pressure in containers from a supplier.

The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes thorough training for its employees in hazard communication; proper handling, transfer, used, and storage methods; and emergency response procedures.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include diligent observation of process vessels, valves, and other equipment; and safe movement and storage of vessels.  The vessels received at the facility, the on-site storage vessel for ammonia, and the small vessels, which store repackaged materials on-site are metal vessels designed to Department of Transportation standards.  Other process vessels are designed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards.  Each metal cylinder and ton container has a steel valve protection cap, which covers the vessel valve or valves.  These steel protective caps are never removed from a container unless the container is being filled.  The warehouse where the chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are stored is a concrete building with a metal roof.  A fire suppression sy"

Several studies have been conducted recently to examine mitigation measures and additional steps to further ensure public safety at the Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility.  The changes primarily include detailed reviews and updates of formal operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures to address comments and recommended actions identified through various analyses.  All recommended changes from the Process Hazard Analysis and Pre-Startup Safety Review have been reviewed and implemented."
