The Phoenix plant maintains a highly cooperative relationship with the Phoenix Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of the processes and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Hill Brothers Chemical Company Phoenix Facility stores, repackages, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also manufactures bleach and stores and distributes chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders to customers.  The Phoenix operations relating to this RMP are described briefly below.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Fill ? Anhydrous ammonia liquefied under pressure is received at the facility in large containers and repackaged into smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.  Until delivery, the repackaged ammonia is stored at this process area.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Storage ? Anhydrous ammonia is received at the facility in large containers and transferred into an on-site storage container.  This material is transferred to smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.\n\nChlorine Fill/Bleach ? Chlorine liquefied under pressure is received and stored on-site in railcars.  The chlorine is transferred to smaller containers for subsequent delivery to customers.  Chlorine is also used to make bleach solution, which is then packaged and delivered to customers.\n\nChlorine in Warehouse ? The smaller chlorine containers that are filled on site are stored in the warehouse until they are delivered to customers.\n\nSulfur Dioxide in Warehouse ? The Phoenix Facility receives sulfur dioxide liquefied under pressure in containers from a supplier.  These containers are stored in the warehouse until they are delivered to customers.  No repackaging or processing occurs with the sulfur dioxide containers.  \n\n\nAccidental Release P"
