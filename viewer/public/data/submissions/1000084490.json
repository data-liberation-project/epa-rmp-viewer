      "SummaryText": "Southern Ionics Incorporated (SII) owns and operates an inorganic chemicals (NAICS 325180) manufacturing plant located at 12901 Bay Park Road, Pasadena, TX.  The facility has been under control of SII since 1983.  The facility primarily manufactures aluminum and sulfur based chemicals at this facility.  \n\n\n\nSouthern Ionics Incorporated has built (2014 construction and 2015 operation) an aqua ammonia tote filling operation / facility at the Pasadena, TX facility.  The system is also capable of filling totes, drums, and/or carboys.  A maximum concentration of 29.5% aqua ammonia will be purchased from the Houston Ammonia Terminal and delivered to Southern Ionics in 7000 gallon capacity truck tankers.   Tote storage area is included in the building facility dedicated to the aqua ammonia process.\n\n\n\nThe offloading dock for the aqua ammonia truck tankers is designed to accommodate two tankers at one time.    However, only one truck can be offloaded at one time.  Operational procedures will prevent the offloading of more than one tanker truck.  \n\n\n\nSII has purchased and installed a stainless steel tote filling station that is contained and vented to a water scrubber.  All ammonia emissions from the tote filling are vented through a water scrubber system per Texas Permit By Rule regulations.  The ammonia vapors are captured in the scrub water.  Sulfuric acid is added to the scrub water basin for neutralization purposes.  The wastewater from the sump of the scrubber is permitted to be discharged under a NPDES permit to Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA).  \n\n\n\nThis operation classifies as an RMP Level 3 program due to the nearby offsite industrial activities.  The worst case scenario is a toxic end point of 0.3 miles from the center of the aqua tote filling operation.  Within this 0.3 miles at least 3 offsite industries are within the toxic end point.  The alternate case toxic end point is 0.1 miles.  \n\n"
