If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to residents and the environment  of our community.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the storage and\nsales of fertilizers to farm producers in our area.\n\n         a. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop \nproduction nutrient.\nb. The maximum quantity stored would be approximately 52,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon\nstorage tank.  The maximum quantity  handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding\n_\n\napproximately 156,000 pounds.\n\n~-\n\n.\n:\n\n    \n3. Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a rail tank car\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be approximately\n156,000 pounds which represents the volume of the rail tank car at 85 percent capacity as limited\nby the design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.  \nb. The alternative release scenario (most likely potential incident) is a release\nfrom a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is\n.33 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program: The facility has implemented the provisions of\n\"Safety-Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published\nby The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U. S. Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of\nAnhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in\nthe past five years tha"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.\nPeriodic evaluations are performed to assess the maineenance of safe conditions. At present, the\ninstallation of 2 remote emergency shutoffs are planned to be installed on the plumbing of the\nliquid lines that are used while unloading of a rail tank car.\n\n8.
