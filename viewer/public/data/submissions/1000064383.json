      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis technical assessment was conducted to fulfill the off-site consequence analysis requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Bridgepoint Northlake facility in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, Section 112(r) under the Clean Air Act.\r\n\r\nThe Bridgepoint, Northlake facility is located in Northlake, IL.  The area surrounding the facility is mostly urban with the area comprised of some commercial facilities and residences.  A local map (Figure 1) indicating the location of the facility with respect to the surrounding area is shown on the following page.\r\n\r\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the industrial refrigeration system that provides cold storage for food products.  This is a new facility with an ammonia system and process areas.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses approximately 11,500 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for warehouse storage areas.\r\n\r\nAs part of this analysis, the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines concentration level 2 (ERPG-2) was used as a toxic endpoint to quantify off-site impact for the plant.  The ERPG-2 was developed to provide estimates of concentration ranges within which adverse health effects can be observed.  Table 1 summarizes the maximum downwind distances at the ERPG-2 and the estimated populations that are at risk to being exposed to the ERPG-2 concentration for each release, as required by the RMP regulation.  The at-risk population numbers are the estimated number of people within the radius of the maximum downwind distance reached by the plume in all wind directions."
