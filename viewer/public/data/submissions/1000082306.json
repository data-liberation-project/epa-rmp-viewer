Any contractor with the potential to affect process safety is evaluated to ensure that they are adequately trained and capable of performing their job function in a safe manner. A contractor's safety record and performance is reviewed during the selection process.  Once a contractor is selected, the plant provides training and procedures to ensure that contractor employees perform their work in a safe manner, are aware of the hazards associated with the area in which they will be working, understand the emergency procedures, and report any hazards they find during their work.  Plant personnel monitor contractor activities to ensure that they perform their work in a safe manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nA compliance audit is performed every three years to help ensure that the prevention program activities are adequate and implemented as required.  Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in the process and process safety management.  Audit results are documented and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.\n\n(d)\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Baltimore plant has not had an accidental release from the chlorine process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last 5 years.\n\n(e)\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Baltimore plant maintains a written emergency response plan that is designed to protect employees, the public and the environment.

This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel and the equipment are prepared for service before the equipment is started-up.  A pre-startup safety review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Baltimore plant promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, serious injury to employees, the public or the environment.  Incident investigations are performed to determine the facts, identify root causes, and provide recommendations for ensuring that the incident does not recur.  Corrective actions resulting from an incident investigation are tracked until they are resolved. The facility has not had an accidental release from the chlorine process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last 5 years. \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Baltimore plant encourages employees to be involved in every aspect of process safety management and accident prevention. Employees are routinely asked to participate all aspects of the prevention program.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of the prevention program and are informed of any changes that occur in their process areas.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nThe Baltimore plant has established safe work practices to ensure the safety of employees.  These proctices include hot work permits to control spark or flame producing activities, a permit and procedure to control confined space entry, and a lockout/tagout procedure for isolating energy sources during maintenance.  These procedures and permits ensure that operations"

In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower operating limits, consequences of deviations and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are reviewed every year to ensure that they are current and accurate.\n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Baltimore plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks. Employees who are new to a process are given basic training that includes a general overview of the process, properties of substances used in the process and their associated hazards, and a detailed review of the operating procedures for the process.  Only after they have demonstrated their understanding of this information are they allowed to work independently.  Employees receive refresher training at least every three years.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Baltimore plant maintains the mechanical integrity of critical equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  An inspection and testing program helps to identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  If a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem. The mechanical integrity system includes inspection and testing procedures, specifications for replacement equipment, safe work practices, and training of maintenance personnel in mechanical integrity procedures.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nProcess changes are reviewed to determine if new hazards will be introduced or existing prevention measures will be compromised.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subjected to a hazard review to ensure that new hazards are not inadvertently introduced into the system, safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, operators in the process are trained in the change, and all process safety documentation is updated.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFET"

Information concerning the technology of the process and the equipment is documented and maintained in engineering design documents.  Technology information includes block flow or simplified process flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum intended inventories, safe operating limits and consequences of deviation.  Equipment information includes materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical classification, relief system design, design codes and standards used, material and energy balances, and safety systems.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThe Baltimore plant uses the What-If methodology to prepare PHAs.  A team comprising personnel with engineering, operations, and maintenance experience systematically examine each section of the process to identify potential process deviations, consequences and hazards. The analysis also examines previous incidents, facility siting and human factors.  The team then compares identified hazards to the existing set of engineering and administrative controls, and makes recommendations to further mitigate hazards where appropriate.  These recommendations are prioritized by management and tracked until they are implemented.  PHAs are updated and revalidated every five years and whenever a significant process change is made.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nPlant management and operators work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of the facility.

(Kemira) is a leader among chemical manufacturers in its safety, health and environmental programs. Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of Kemira's way of doing business. Kemira has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet all regulatory requirements.\n\n(b)\tSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nKemira's Baltimore Plant is located on the south side of the Baltimore harbor near Hawkins Point.  The plant manufactures ferric chloride using iron-bearing materials and chlorine as raw materials.  Ferric chloride is sold to customers for use as a purifying agent in water treatment processes.\n\nChlorine is a regulated substance and is received and stored at the facility in railroad tankcars.  Chlorine tankcars are piped directly to a vessel where iron-bearing materials are chlorinated to produce ferric chloride.  Other than chlorine tankcar storage and unloading, there is no handling of chlorine at the facility.  The worst case scenarios for a chlorine release from the facility involve a release from a chlorine tankcar. The alternate release scenario involves a 10-minute leak from a 1-inch diameter pipe at 100 psig. \n\n(c)\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nKemira's Baltimore Plant takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals. A management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described in the sections below.  This prevention program has been implemented for the ferric chloride process.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Baltimore Plant maintains technical documents that describe the chemicals and"
