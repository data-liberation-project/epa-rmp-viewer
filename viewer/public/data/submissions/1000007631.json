The City of Boulder's 75th St. Wastewater Treatment Plant uses chlorine above the 2,500 pound threshold quantity and sulfur dioxide above the 5,000 pound threshold quantity, thus the City developed and submitted a Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe chlorine room is equipped to store fifteen, one-ton containers. Six chlorine cylinders are on scales (three per manifold) and hooked up to feed, and the remainder are on the floor on permanent trunnions. The maximum chlorine inventory is 30,000 pounds. Each manifold is equipped with a regulator and connected to an automatic switch-over valve.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide room is equipped to feed, two, one-ton containers. Furthermore, up to seven additional sulfur dioxide containers are stored outdoors. A fence was installed around the cylinders stored outside so the public can not see the containers. Both of the sulfur dioxide cylinders in the feed room are on scales and hooked up to feed. The maximum sulfur dioxide inventory is 18,000 pounds. The two cylinders on the scales are each equipped with regulators and heat traced trap legs and are connected to an automatic switch-over valve.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe 75th St. WWTP Emergency Response Plan and notebook are revised on an ongoing basis, and last updated during the first half of 2009. The plan is considered dynamic, and further changes may occur. All operators at the WWTP are trained in operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, and follow all appropriate safety procedures. Both management and staff are committed to ensuring safety at the WWTP.\n\nSafety training classes"

Hazard Communication classes were held in late 2008, and classes planned for 2009 include: Slips, Trips, and Falls; Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Repair Kits; Lock Out/Tag Out; Lightening; Mower Safety; Fall Protection; PPE; Fire Prevention; Confined Space Entry; Workplace Hazards; Personal Safety; and Safety Awareness. In addition, a Cl2/SO2 ER response drill is planned for 2009.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe 75th Street WWTP had no reportable accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n \nFUTURE PLANS RELATED TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM:\n\nA design/construction project to improve wastewater treatment quality (additional nitrification and partial denitrification) has been implemented. In addition to effluent water quality improvements, Boulder plans to design and construct an alternative system for disinfection/dechlorination. The revised system will do away with the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas and replace it with ultra-violet disinfection.  The\nultra-violet disinfection alternative has been recommended by the Utility staff and our design consultants, Brown and Caldwell and Carollo. The plan is to construct the UV system in 2010/2011. When the new system is on line, the City will complete the necessary steps to decertify the current RMP required as a result of our current gaseous feed disinfection system.\n\n"
