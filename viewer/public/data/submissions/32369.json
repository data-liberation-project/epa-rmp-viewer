Senior management as well as system operators administer the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs.\n\nThe WRF has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Colton Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Colton to evacuate employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  Facility operators will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nColton has established procedures to make all on-site workers and contractors aware of the potential dangers and how to respond in case of an emergency. The WRF intends to conduct an Emergency Response drill at least once per year. Public notification in case of a release with potential off-site impact will be handled by the Colton Fire Department and the Colton Police.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE.\n\nThe City of Colton Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) is located at 1201 South Rancho Ave. in Colton CA. The facility contact is William F. Roth, Wastewater Utilities Manager. The WRF is a wastewater treatment plant that performs preliminary, primary and secondary treatment. Preliminary treatment consists of grit chambers to remove heavy debris and bar screens to remove sticks, rags and other large debris. Primary treatment uses settling to remove floatable and settleable solids. Secondary treatment follows primary treatment and uses biological processes to remove approximately 90 percent of the oxygen demanding substances and suspended solids that remain after primary treatment.\n\nThe rated capacity of the WRF is 8.4 million gallons per day (mgd).  The facility treats domestic, commercial and industrial wastes generated with"

The treatment steps consist of screening and grit removal, followed by primary clarification, biological oxidization and secondary clarification. Sludge treatment consists of dissolved air floatation, primary and secondary anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion and de-watering.\n\nThe WRF uses chlorine for disinfection to control filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge process and to control algae growth in the WRF wash water system.  The maximum amount of chlorine on-site at any time is four one-ton containers. The chlorine in the containers is liquefied and under pressure. The maximum amount of chlorine on-line at any time is one-ton. Up to three additional one-ton containers are kept in storage in a horizontal position. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe City of Colton Water Reclamation Facility has a Process Safety Management/Risk Management Program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are two mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine sensors / detectors and 2) alarms.  The chlorine sensors that trigger visual and audible alarms are located in the chlorine storage room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine alarm system will notify the facility of the chlorine leak through the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nAn investigation into the City of Colton Water Reclamation Facility's accident history revealed that there have been no reportable chlorine releases over the last five"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is reviewed and updated by the facility at least once a year.  This Plan will be review and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nThe WRF has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Colton Fire Department.  In the case of a chlorine-related emergency, it is the policy of Colton to evacuate employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  Facility operators will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation (June 2004) provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the City of Colton Water Reclamation Facility.  The PHA was comprised of one session that included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine system since the 1999 PHA Revalidation, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the 1999 PHA Revalidation and 2002 PSM/RMP audit, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the review of chlorine checklists, and a site inspection to review seismic issues.
