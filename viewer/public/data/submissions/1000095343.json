As part of this commitment, INEOS has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) which helps manage the risks and which complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: the RMP rule.  This plan summary is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP Rule (40 CFR 68.150 through 40 CFR 68.185). \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nINEOS is committed to the welfare of its employees, the public, and to the preservation of the environment. INEOS implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of an accidental release, INEOS will conduct emergency response action to help prevent or minimize injury to the public and the environment. \n\n\n\nFacility Process and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe INEOS Battleground Manufacturing Complex (BMC) is comprised of multiple polyethylene facilities and a polypropylene facility. The polypropylene facility manufactures polypropylene resins for a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications such as plastic bottles, chip bags, children's toys, and car parts. Covered chemicals for the BMC site which are stored in the polypropylene facility are propylene, isobutane, and 1-butene.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\n1.    Process Safety Information - BMC maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the covered processes. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) document the physical properties of all hazardous substances handled. The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment of the covered process, and references to app"

Process Hazard Analysis - BMC performs and periodically updates risk assessments of the covered processes to ensure systematic identification and control of process hazards. A corporate procedure for the conduct of PHAs and the qualitative assessment of risk includes consideration of off-site consequences and harm to the environment or the public. \n\n3.    Operating Procedures - BMC maintains its operating procedures under an ISO9000 program. As such, it is required to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operation should be performed. The operating procedures are used to train employees and contractors and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. \n\n4.    Training - To complement the written procedures for process operations, BMC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive initial training, including on-the-job training and classroom training. A unit walkthrough test and final peer review panel ensure a required level of practical knowledge by operators. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n5.    Mechanical Integrity - BMC has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality "

Management of Change - BMC utilizes a change management tool to ensure the proper reviews are conducted, hazards assessed, and a safe operation is maintained during and after a permanent or temporary change is implemented to a covered process. Each MOC includes a risk assessment to identify the potential hazards of the change as well as a review of the supplemental checklist which is used to identify additional documentation and communication requirements and to raise questions that may not surface during the risk assessment.  Approval and action items are tracked in the MOC database. \n\n7.    Pre-Startup Review - BMC performs review on a new or existing process which is modified in a manner which requires updating of process safety information. This review confirms (1) proper equipment was used, (2) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are updated, (3) a risk assessment has been conducted, and (4) training has been implemented. \n\n8.    Compliance Audits - BMC performs PSM and RMP compliance audits at least every three years. Audits targeting specific regulatory element requirements may be performed more frequent through the Operational Audit process, if needed. \n\n9.    Incident Investigation - BMC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment. The incident investigation procedure requires an investigation team to be assembled and that the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. \n\n10.    Employee Participation - BMC promotes employee participation via the site Process Safety Committee (PSC), which manages the elements of the PSM and RMP program at the site and includes hourly personnel. \n\n11.

Contractors - BMC reviews all contractors prior to working on or near a covered process. The contractor must submit information that indicates the work can be performed competently and safely. The company will provide information on the hazards of the process and the safety practices in place. Documents are kept to confirm that the information was received and understood. In addition, procedures are in place which require the entrance, presence, and exit of contractors to be controlled. \n\n13.    Chemical-specific Prevention Steps - In addition to engineering review and hazard analysis previously mentioned, workers who perform operations involving covered chemicals receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures develop by INEOS. In addition, several equipment safeguards are in place such as: hydrocarbon detection, automated deluge systems, related piping and vessel periodic inspection and maintenance, and continuous process monitoring for operations. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\n\n\nINEOS BMC has established a written emergency response plan which complies with the RMP rule and with other federal contingency plans. This plan has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Regular dialogue is maintained between the facility and the local response personnel. The facility has fully trained volunteer responders covering all four rotating shifts to ensure 24-hour coverage. Each shift has minimum role requirements to ensure adequate emergency response at all times. INEOS BMC periodically conducts emergency response drills including annual drills coordinated with the local response authorities. BMC has an Incident Management Team staffed with Site Management, Engineering, Safety, Logistics and Emergency Responders. INEOS BMC is a member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA). CIMA supplements on-site emergency "

The area was secured and medical assistance was immediately provided. No additional significant consequences occurred. This accident was reported to the EPA in 2018 as part of the RMP correction process.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nSignificant emergency response capital investments were made recently at the facility including the construction of a new administration building. The building includes a dedicated and upgraded Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and a dedicated Incident Management Team (IMT) conference room. Site security has been improved, including upgraded perimeter surveillance cameras and other advanced access controls.  Emergency response capability has been improved by replacing a number of firewater pumps and motors and by procuring new CIMA radios for mutual aid response.\n\n\n\nThe INEOS Olefins and Polymers risk assessment process uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to systematically assess risk and continually improve event detection and mitigation. Capital projects are continually identified and implemented through this risk assessment process.\n\n\n\n"
