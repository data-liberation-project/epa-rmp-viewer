      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nPactiv Corporation.\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nCorsicana, TX\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Pactiv are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of  processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \n\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket and foam cups.  We have two substances present at our facility which are regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  These substances are isobutane and pentane; and are referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The regulated substances at our facility are used as a foaming agents in the production of polystyrene foam.  These products are also often referred to as \"blowing agents\" or \"expansion agents\" .\n\nThe maximum inventory of the blowing agents exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold for RMP.  Written procedures and high-level alarms prevent overfilling the storage tank.\n\n\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to compl"

      "SummaryText": "y with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPactiv maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our covered process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Pactiv maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily available to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPactiv utilizes a detailed training program to ensure that employees who are operating processes using regulated substances are skilled in the handling, operation, and maintenance procedures associated with these covered processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical"
