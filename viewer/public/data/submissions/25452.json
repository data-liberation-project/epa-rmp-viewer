Facility policy\nThe owners, management and employees of the Elkton Farmers Union Coop Oil Ass'n are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Elkton Fire Dept, Brookings County LEPC and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n      \n2. Facility information\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 180,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst case scenario and alternate release scenario. \nA. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as gas over a period of ten minuets.  The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by the design standards and adminitrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 4.4 miles.\nB. The alternate release scenario: a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before the automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point at which dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.7  mile.  (The most likely potential accident, would be a release from a break in a 1 inch transfer hose scenario followed be a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before the automatic excess flow shut down valve intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released"

Accidental release prevention program\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910,111, ?Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia?.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP registration form, see section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five-Year accident history.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, of significant property damage at the facility, nor, to our knowledge, has there been and accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Action Plan\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process of the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the Elkton Farmers Union Coop Oil Ass'n.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
