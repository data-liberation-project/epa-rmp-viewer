      "SummaryText": "1.  FACILITY POLICY\nThe owners, management and employees of Blick's, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Adams County LEPC or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe primary activity at this facility is the movement of anhydrous ammonia on a wholesale basis.  This involves receiving of the ammonia by truck or rail, unloading,transfer into storage tanks, and transfer of the ammonia to tanker trucks as required for distribution.  This operation is also covered under OSHA's PSM regulations.  \nA secondary activity at this faclility is the ocassional production of a fluid fertilizer using a portable pipe reactor.  The portable unit is brought on-site and is connected to the ammonia supply from the tanks.  The operation of the pipe reactor is also covered under a separate PSM.  The operation and maintenance procedures used during this operation are maintained by the pipe reactor personnel.  \nThe Emergency Responses Procedures for each of the two units are integrated into one prior to the operation of the pipe reactor unit.\n\n3.  WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of one of the 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  This could result in the release of up to 130,000 # of liquid ammonia over a 10 minute period.   The ammoia being released from the pressure in the tank would vaporize.  The distance to the end point is 6.7 miles calculated using RMP Comp.\nThe alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, is the failure or a leak in the process piping system.  This could result in the release of 260 #/min of ammonia over a 15 minute period.  The distance to the end point is 0.3 miles calculated using RMP Comp.  \nA similar alternative release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario (hose rupture) involving the portable pipe reactor would also give an end point of 0.3 miles.  \n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of it's compliance with the PSM rule, the facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammoia K-61.1\", pubished by the American Health Standards Institute, Inc.  The use of established operating and maintenance procedures is emphasized.\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years at the facility; and to our knowledge, no off-site consequences reported.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan and has provided the state and local authrities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic reviews are performed to assess the maintenance and operations to establish safe operating conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
