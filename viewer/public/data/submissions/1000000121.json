The facility management ensures that facility personnel continue to adhere to these safety procedures.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: The Global Tungsten and Powders Corp. (A?GTPA?) Towanda facility manufactures specialized materials for the cutting tools, lighting and automotive industries.  The facility is subject to Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7), and the corresponding regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, because of the on-site storage of anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen and aqueous ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia and hydrogen storage operations comply with Prevention Program 3 of the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"), and the aqueous ammonia operations comply with the Prevention Program 2. \n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: The facility has developed and instituted procedures to prevent and effectively respond to any accidental releases from the processes.  These procedures were developed in accordance with both the OSHA PSM standards in 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and RMP 40 C.F.R. Part 68 requirements.  The facility regularly trains personnel who are responsible for operating and maintaining the processes, both in the classroom and on the job.  Additionally, the anhydrous ammonia storage system complies with OSHA's storage and handling requirements set forth in 29 C.F.R. 1910.11.  An outside supplier who incorporates safe procedures maintains the hydrogen storage and supply system.\n\nFive-Year Accident History: The facility has had no RMP-reportable incidents of anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen and aqueous ammonia since the submission of the last RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has an existing emergency response plan that contains emergency response and coordination procedures for releases f"

Pursuant to this review procedure, the facility recently completed the following items:     \nSafety Department personal completed a Root Cause analysis web training seminar.  \nThe calibration department reviewed and updated its calibration procedures for the ammonia sensors at the storage area.  \n"
