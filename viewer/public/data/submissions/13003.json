Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe EPA RMP requires offsite consequence analysis to include the worst case flammable and toxic release scenarios as well as alternative cases for at least one flammable and all toxic substances.\n\nWorst Case Toxic:    Release of the entire 156,000 lb. Inventory of ammonia from tank V-23 in 10 minutes.\n\n\nAlternate Case Toxic:    (1)  Tank V-23 becomes overfilled with liquid.  The relief valve opens and fails to reseat, resulting in a release.  The storage conditions were assumed to be 72 degrees F and 120 psig.  The release duration for this case was 60 minutes.  Relief valve diameter is 2.5 inches and is found at an elevation of 14.7 feet.  The distance to toxic endpoint was found to be 0.43 miles.\n\n    (2)  Catastrophic rupture of liquid loading hose caused by the truck driving off while still connected (or other cause).  Duration assumed is 30 minutes and a hose diameter of 3 inches is assumed.  The truck inventory is assumed to be 20 tons and the liquid head was set to 3.3 feet.  Unfavorable weather conditions of night time and low wind were used for this modeling.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was found to be 6.0 miles.\n\n\nWorst Case Flammable:    None applicable.\n\n\n    Alternate Case Flammable:    None applicable.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Pasadena facility.  The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, Hazard Communication, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\nThe Pasadena facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments or suggestions.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and or other techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; perons knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.

Implementaion of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is base on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned to the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA ream findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\n     1.  age of process\n     2.  extent of process hazards\n     3.  number of affected employees\n     4.  operating history of the process\n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTRAINING\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is  to be a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees are to receive basic training in process operations and procedures.  In addition, all operators are periodically to receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause , and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involv"

The basic aspects of this program are to include the following:\n     1.  training\n     2.  developing written procedures\n     3.  performing inspections and test consistent with good engineering practices\n     4.  correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits\n     5.  applying quality assurance measures\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on the following:\n     1.  an overview of the process\n     2.  safety and health hazards\n     3.  applicable maintenance procedures\n     4.  emergency response plans\n     5.  applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  Quality assurance measures are incorporated into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\nSeveral actions are to be incorporated during construction of new processes or equipment to ensure these are suiteable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:\n1.  control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel\n2.  a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance\n3.  a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before proc"

The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Pasadena facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  The audit team develops finding in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC AND UNIVERSAL PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Pasadena facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following sections include descriptions of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP covered process at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSPECIALIZED SAFETY FEATURES\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickely detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequ"
