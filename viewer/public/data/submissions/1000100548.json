Specific practices that are important to Durango Midstream's  prevention program include a rigorous maintenance program, ongoing safety training, compliance audits, incident investigation, written operating procedures, and process hazard analysis.\n\nDurango Midstream Company has provided onsite tours of the facility to local fire and rescue departments. Durango Midstream has also provided such entities with a written emergency action plan. Facility personnel are trained in several aspects of emergency response including the proper use of facility SCBAs, fire extinguishers, and H2S safety. It is Durango Midstream's intent that regularly scheduled drills be held to ensure that the facility personnel are aware to the emergency action plan. In addition, the emergency response plan will be reviewed annually with facility personnel and appropriate changes made.\n\nDurango Midstream is committed to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Our corporate objectives are to continually increase our reserves while minimizing our costs, preventing significant impact to the environment, and protecting the health and safety of employees and the public. Durango Midstream is committed to complying with all existing and relevant safety and environmental laws and regulations. Durango Midstream will continue to commit resources to the pursuit of fair interpretation of existing laws and enactment of future laws based on sound science and economic reality.\nDurango Midstream continually considers new technologies, systems, and methods of organization that enhance its ability to achieve these business, safety and environmental objectives and periodicall"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Frontier Field Services Dagger Draw Gas Plant is a reconditioned facility that began operations in February 2006. Durango Midstream purchased the Lucid Energy Dagger Draw Gas Plant in September 2021. The facility has been successfully operating for approximately one year.\n\nThe operation of the Frontier Field Services Dagger Draw Gas Plant is intended to process 75 MMSCFD of gas. The gas is treated to remove acid gas components, dehydrated to remove water and processed to remove heavy (liquid) hydrocarbons from the gas stream. Several plant systems will be involved to perform these functions. The acid gas that is removed by the amine unit will be disposed of by either acid gas injection into a disposal well or by incinerating in a flare. The preferred method of disposal will be to compress the gas and inject it into the well. Under emergency situations, the gas will be flared to prevent the emission of lethal hydrogen sulfide to atmosphere. The cryogenic unit is designed to liquefy natural gas liquids from the sweet, dehydrated inlet gas by removing work (heat) from the gas be means of the turbo expander. The cryogenic unit recovers natural gas liquids (NGL) by cooling the gas stream to extremely cold temperatures (-130 F) and condensing components such as ethane, propane, butanes and heavier. It is the presence of these flammable NGL that cause the facility to be subject to the OSHA PSM process and thus the RMP process.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the unit with the largest amount of NGL (cryo unit 3) had either a catastrophic failure (worst case scenario) or a small leak (alternative scenario). The flammable material is composed of a mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. For both the worst case and alternative scenario, the mixture was assumed to be composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage, i.e. highest heat of combustion or pooling factor.\n\nThe Frontier"
