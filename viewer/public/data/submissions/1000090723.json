Our commitment to protect our employees and the communities that are home to our operations is an integral part of KEMIRA's way of doing business.  KEMIRA has established safety, health, emergency response and environmental policies and standards to meet all regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\n(b) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur facility has 3 processes that involve a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Plant makes water-soluble organic polymers and mining chemicals used for the development of new technologies and improving on existing formulations in the mining, water treating and paper markets.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution.\n\n\n\nThe polyacrylamide emulsion manufacturing process (EPAM) makes water-soluble organic polymers that are used to remove solids from a number of different wastewater applications.   The regulated substance involved with this operation is 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution\n\n\n\nThe Bio-Acrylamide manufacturing process (Bio-AMD) makes Bio-AMD from acrylonitrile and biological enzymes for use as a raw material in the Pilot Plant and EPAM processes along with shipment to other plants as a raw material in their processes. \n\n\n\n(c) THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nKEMIRA's general accidental release prevention program includes:\n\n\n\n- EPA 40 CFR 68 - Risk Management Plans\n\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals \n\n- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 - Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response\n\n- Other EPA, OSHA, DOT and State regulations\n\n- Generally recognized & accepted engineering codes and standards, and\n\n- KEMIRA Safety, Health, Environmental and Engineering standards\n\n\n\nThe following engineering and"

The procedures are designed to be implemented in case of fire, explosion, chemical release which may arise as a result of our own operations, adjacent operations or the forces of nature.  These procedures are set up to be implemented in two primary areas; 1.) in plant and 2.) in conjunction with the community.\n\n\n\nThe in plant portion of the emergency response plan provides for employee notification of an emergency through an alarm system and in plant response with operations personnel to take immediate remedial actions.  The Mobile Fire and Rescue Hazmat Team and fully trained and equipped contract services are readily available.  The in plant emergency response protocols also provide for communications, notifications, procedures for emergency shut down, and mitigation.  The in plant system is t"

This is done through participation in the Mobile County LEPC as well as with the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency which coordinates mutual aid for the entire Mobile area chemical manufacturing community.  Participation is achieved through planning meetings, public forums, annual emergency drills.  The KEMIRA Plant also interfaces frequently with community based emergency response groups such as the fire department and local hazardous materials response team.  Plant tours and readiness evaluations for these organizations are conducted on an annual basis.\n\n\n\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nKEMIRA Chemicals, Inc. is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\n\n\n\nSpecific improvements currently planned that will directly improve safety in the plant include:\n\n\n\n- Implementation of a Behavioral Based Safety Program. \n\n- Set KPIs for participation and hazard awareness response time. \n\n- Improve quality of observations by including hazard recognition in the observation form.\n\n- Track follow up actions on employee safety concerns.\n\n- Implement process and personnel safety improvements based on findings arising from LEAN Manufacturing events.\n\n- Additional  scheduled focused management safety walks thru plant.\n\n- Increased frequency of safety training and communication thru weekly toolbox training topics and weekly safety Journal."
