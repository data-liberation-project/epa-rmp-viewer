Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as loop testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested with hydrostatic tests prior and after installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements. MP2 Maintenance Software is utilized to manage predictive, preventive and repair maintenance items.\n\n\nFive-year accident history.\n\nPilot Chemical Company\u00bfs Houston facility has not had a release of a regulated chemical that meets the EPA's reporting guidelines in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe plant has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes procedures for informing emergency response organizations of an emergency condition; documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; and procedures and measures for emergency response.  \n\nPlanned changes to Improve Safety\n\nPilot Chemical Company is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes in control instruments are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary, to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used.  \n\n\nFor additional plant information, contact Russell Brown, Plant Manager, at phone number 281-448-3222.
