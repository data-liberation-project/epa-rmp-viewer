      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of EMD Millipore Corporation in Norwood, Ohio to have both fully developed proactive and reactive programs to prevent chemical releases and to mitigate them if they should occur. This is accomplished through adherence to applicable regulations and corporate policies, hazard assessments; process design; facilities and equipment; procedures, training; investigation of incidents; emergency notification and response programs.  EMD Millipore Corporation maintains an environmental management system which is certified to fulfill the environmental principles and elements of the international ISO 14001 standard.\n\n\n\nFacility Description\n\n\n\nThe EMD Millipore Norwood facility consists of approximately 23 acres located on both the north and south sides of Highland Avenue at 2909 Highland Avenue and 2910 Highland Avenue.  The operations on the north side are specifically for warehousing and distribution of finished goods.  There is also an office building on this side of the site.  The operations on the south side include raw material receiving and storage, distillation and packaging of high purity solvents, liquid blending and packaging as well as laboratory functions.\n\n\n\nRegulated substances handled in excess of threshold limits include chloroform, ethyl ether and 37% hydrochloric acid.  Chloroform is received in tank trucks at a spill controlled tank farm and is off-loaded into a storage tank or directly to the process for distillation and/or packaging.  Ethyl ether is received in tank trucks that are unloaded from a spill containment pad near building #4 into the packaging area within the building.  Hydrochloric acid is received as a finished product which is placed in our warehouse for storage and shipment to customers.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nEMD Millipore has multiple systems, programs, procedures, equipment and facilities to prevent accidental chemical release.  All RMP covered pro"

      "SummaryText": "cesses are evaluated through hazard assessments to identify at risk areas and opportunities for improvement.  These include process hazard analysis, job hazard analysis, management of change reviews and various safety and environmental audits.  Identification of significant risk leads to system changes that will help prevent chemical releases.  The site also follows all of the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard as applicable.\n\n\n\nThe systems and facilities for handling chloroform provide an example of our release prevention program.  Tank trucks of material are brought on site and parked within a fully contained unloading area.  The truck entrance and all unloading activities are managed directly by a trained EMD operator.  All piping connections, hoses, transfer pumps and related unloading operations are within a concrete containment area that will direct any spill to a collection trench.  There are chemical vapor sensors above the containment area that will alarm in the presence of a spill and shut down the transfer system.  There are redundant high level sensing systems on the storage tank that will prevent overfilling by stopping the pump and providing an audible alarm.  The storage tank is fully enclosed in a concrete vault the will capture any release.  Also, as in all the site RMP covered processes on site, there is a fire protection system in place.\n\n\n\nEquipment in all RMP covered processes has a mechanical integrity and maintenance program to assure continual performance of our systems.  Our management of change system controls modifications to the equipment and facilities.  As a demonstration of the effectiveness of our system, there have been no accidents at the site during the past five years which meet the RMP required reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nThe site has a number of interlock and alarm systems to provide notification of emergencies including spills and fires.  The site also has its own trained hazardous material"

There is a specific site wide announcement system for spills that will alert this team to respond.  Further there is a complete set of emergency procedures in place.  All EMD Millipore employees are trained in their responsibilities during emergencies, whether these responsibilities are active or passive.  The Norwood and Cincinnati Fire Departments are familiar with the facility.  Fire Department site tours are conducted yearly to familiarize them with the facility and the materials handled.  We also hold emergency response drills with offsite responders.\n\n\n\nContinual Improvement\n\n\n\nEMD Millipore strives to continually improve our facilities and processes.  The Norwood site has been certified to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard for several years.  We have maintained this standing through multiple third party audits of our environmental programs."
