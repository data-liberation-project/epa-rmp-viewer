The\nAltonah  Plant qualifies for Program 1 under the  RMP  rule.   As\npart  of  this commitment, CFS has established a system  to  help\nensure  safe  operation of the processes at this  facility.   One\ncomponent  of  this system is a Risk Management Plan  (RMP)  that\nhelps  manage  the  risks  at  CFS and  that  complies  with  the\nrequirements  of  the Environmental Protection  Agency's  (EPA's)\nregulation   40  CFR  part  68,  Accidental  Release   Prevention\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).\n\nOne  of  the  requirements of the RMP rule is to  submit  a  risk\nmanagement  plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management  program\nat  CFS.   This  document  is  intended  to  satisfy  the  RMPlan\nrequirement  of  the RMP rule and to provide the  public  with  a\ndescription of the risk management program at CFS.\n\nUnder  Program 1 of the RMP rule, the Plant's RMPlan consists  of\nthree (3) elements:\n\n1)   A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite\n     consequences of hypothetical accidental releases;\n\n2)   Accident history documenting that no accidents have occurred\n     during  the last five (5) years associated with the  use  of\n     substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n3)   An emergency response program coordinated with the community\n     response organizations to help respond to accidental releases of\n     regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this\nRMPlan.\n\nAlthough the RMP program at CFS helps provide assurance that  the\nfacility is maintained and operated in a safe mann"

Before  using  a\nhazardous  substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.\nWhen a hazardous substance is used at CFS, consideration is given\nto  the  potential  for  this substance to adversely  affect  CFS\nworkers,  the public, and the environment and CFS takes steps  to\nprevent any such effects.\n\n\n                                                 \n  Issue Date:    Revision Date:     Revision         Page 2\n   06/08/99         05/07/99       Number: 1\n\n\nCFS  prevents releases of the hazardous substances  used  at  the\nfacility.

Industry  and  government\nstandards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and\noperation of the equipment.\n\nCFS  limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  CFS\ntrains workers to respond to an emergency response, reducing  the\nconsequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition,  CFS  works\nwith  the  local  fire  department and with the  local  emergency\nplanning  committee  (LEPC) to limit injuries  and  environmental\ndamage if a release does occur.\n\nThe  Altonah Plant RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those\nparts required by the RMP rule.\n\nNew Ownership\n\nIn March 1999, CFS acquired the Altonah Gas Plant and surrounding\npipeline  gathering system from Gary Williams Energy Corporation.\nSince  this  ownership  change, CFS  has  begun  the  process  of\nassimilating  and  reviewing all available Gary  Williams  Energy\nplans, procedures, permits, and other pertinent operating data to\nensure it "

CFS  implements\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of  hazardous\nsubstances.

The  offsite\nconsequence  analysis consists of evaluate a  worst-case  release\nscenario.  CFS does not expect a worst-case to ever occur.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis\nis to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur\nto  the  public  because  of an accidental  release  (called  the\nendpoint  distance).  Minimal effects could occur at the endpoint\ndistance.   At  distances  less than the endpoint  distance,  the\neffects  would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint\ndistance, the effect would be less.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case\nrelease scenarios that must be reported by CFS in Program 1\nprocesses.  The following information summarizes the offsite\nconsequence analysis performed by CFS.\n\nProgram 1 Processes\n     Flammable Substances:\n\nThe  worst-case  release  scenario for  flammable  substances  is\nfailure  of  the 30,000-gallon butane/gasoline mix storage  tank,\nresulting in a vapor cloud explosion.

This method predicts  the\nactual  explosion  hazard  for  the  tank  in  open  areas   more\naccurately than various other modeling techniques.\n\nThere are no offsite receptors located within this distance.
