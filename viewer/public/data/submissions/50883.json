      "SummaryText": "The City of Tulsa stores liquid chlorine in two 25-ton aboveground storage tanks at the Mohawk Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  Chlorine is provided for primary disinfection and filter cleansing. It is the City of Tulsa?s policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur and the City of Tulsa was not able to contain the release, the City will notify the Tulsa Fire Department HAZMAT Team and Brenntag Southwest, Inc. (chlorine supplier) to request assistance in responding to the emergency.\n\nChlorine is a toxic gas stored as a liquid under pressure.  Chlorine vapors are irritating and corrosive to eyes, skin, and the respiratory tract and react violently with easily oxidized materials.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground and collect in low areas and fill below ground areas such as pits and sumps.   \n\nThe chlorine storage tanks are located inside the chemical feed building.  The bulk storage tanks were designed, constructed, tested, and marked in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels.  Chlorine is fed to the process using vacuum chlorinators.  In addition, the storage room is equipped with an air collection system and packed tower scrubber to minimize the impact of a potential release.  The chlorine scrubber system is designed to withdraw air-containing chlorine from the building.  The contaminated air passes through a weak caustic solution to neutralize the chlorine before discharge to the atmosphere.  The scrubber system was designed in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code and is large enough to treat the contents of one 25-ton storage tank.  The storage tanks, relief valves, piping, and appurtenances were designed in accordance with Chlorine Institute Standards.\n\nThe Mohawk WTP complies with EPA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local regulations.

      "SummaryText": "tanks, scrubber system, piping, evaporators, and associated equipment are designed, manufactured, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable ASTM, Chlorine Institute, and Uniform Fire Code Standards.  The City of Tulsa has completed a hazard review of the chlorine system and documented the findings.  Operations and maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented.  All employees responsible for the operation of the chlorine system have been trained and a training certification is provided in the Risk Management Plan.  \n\nThe Mohawk WTP has not experienced a chlorine release during the last 5 years.\n\nThe City of Tulsa has prepared and implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for chlorine releases.  The purpose of the ERP is to protect employees and the public in the event of an accidental release.  City of Tulsa personnel will initiate the emergency response plan and will provide the initial response to a chlorine emergency.  Responsible personnel have been trained in accordance with the City Health and Safety procedures and the RMP in the use of personnel protective equipment and required emergency response equipment.  If Mohawk personnel are unable to contain a chlorine release with an emergency repair kit, outside assistance will be requested.  The City of Tulsa Fire Department, HAZMAT Team, Police Department, and Brenntag Southwest, Inc. (chlorine supplier) will provide outside assistance.  The responsibilities of each outside agency are provided in the RMP.  The Program 3 Prevention Program is also included.  This program contains the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM).  The goal of the PSM is to reduce the risk of injury or death to employees and the public from the accidental release of chlorine at the Mohawk Water Treatment Plant."
