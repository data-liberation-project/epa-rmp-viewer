For normal operating conditions, there is a bank of four one-ton cylinders of chlorine which are on a scale and connected to the main manifold header system.  One of these four one-ton cylinders is in service at a time, with the other three cylinders available for service when the in-service cylinder is exhausted.  There is a fifth one-ton cylinder on a separate scale and connected to a separate header for use if the main manifold header system becomes inoperable.  The remaining five one-ton cylinders are stored in the room for use when the five connected cylinders are exhausted.  Chlorine gas is fed from the cylinders through two pressure regulators (one on each feed line) to one of three vacuum chlorinators located in the Chlorine Feed Room.  From the vacuum chlorinators, chlorine is fed in solution under vacuum pressure to five water-operated injectors provided for chlorine feed at various process locations.",

      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nUSEPAA?s Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68), published in the Federal Register on June 20, 1996, was developed to assist facilities in preventing accidental releases of highly toxic or flammable chemicals.  The RMP applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under Section 68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts.  These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2, and 3.  Program 1 applies to any process that has not had an accidental release with prescribed offsite consequences for five years and has no public receptors impacted by a worst-case release.  Program 3 applies to processes in specified industries, and to all processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  Program 2 applies to processes not covered by Programs 1 or 3.\n\nThe Cincinnati Water Works, Charles M. Bolton Plant (CMBP) utilizes more than a threshold quantity of chlorine (2,500 pounds) in their process.  Therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in Section 68.150 by June 18, 2009 (five years after the previous June, 2004 RMP submission).  Public employees are covered under the State of OhioA?s Public Employee Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), which has adopted by reference the requirements of OSHAA?s (PSM) Standard.  Based on the March 1999 revised USEPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) (EPA 550-B-98-010), the Charles M. Bolton Plant is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and the worst case release scenario impacts public receptors.  Therefore, the Charles M. Bolton Plant Chlorination Facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the RMP Regulation.  \n\nUSEPAA?s RMP Rule requires that covered facilities prepare an Ex"

The following pages represent the Executive Summary, summarizing the items required as described in 40 CFR 68.155 (a) through (f).\n\n\nSection 68.155(a): Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nThe Charles M. Bolton Plant (CMBP) has emergency response procedures in place, as documented in the facilityA?s Emergency Action Plan.  This plan has been documented by the City staff responsible for the operation and maintenance of the CMBP.  The CMBP has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders, which must be followed in the event of a chlorine leak.  All personnel involved in handling chlorine are trained with regard to chlorine safety and accident prevention.\n\n\nSection 68.155(b): Stationary Source and Substance Handled.\n\nThe stationary source subject to 40 CFR Part 68 is the Charles M. Bolton Plant (CMBP) Chlorination System.  The CMBP has a design capacity of 40 million gallons of water per day (MGD) and treats groundwater to drinking water standards.  The CMBP Chlorination System is located in the Administration and Filtration Building, and is divided into two rooms dedicated to specific tasks: the Storage/Unloading Room, and the Chlorine Feed Room.\n\nThe Storage/Unloading Room houses a maximum of ten (10) one-ton containers that store chlorine as a pressurized liquid.  For normal operating conditions, there are four one-ton containers of chlorine connected to the main header system.  There is a fifth one-ton container connected to a separate manifold for use if the main header system is inoperable.  The remaining five one-ton containers are stored in the room for use when the on-line containers are exhausted.  Chlorine gas is fed from the containers through an automatic, vacuum operated switchover valve, and then under vacuum to the chlorinators in the Chlorine Feed Room.

One chlorine leak detector is located in the Storage/Unloading Room and one in the Chlorine Feed Room.  To allow safety personnel time to respond to emergencies, an audible warning alarm sounds inside and outside of the building when chlorine levels reach 1.0 ppm.  At 3.0 ppm a high level alarm is sounded and the normal building ventilation system automatically shuts down to contain the chlorine.  In addition, the chlorine detector alarms are connected to the CMBP control panel, and the CMBP and Richard Miller Water Treatment Plant SCADA system.  This alerts the staff at all plants in the event of a chlorine release.\nThere is also a dry media single-pass chlorine scrubber designed to neutralize the entire contents of a fully loaded one-ton cylinder. The scrubber is activated by an alarm state on either of the two chlorine detectors. The system will run until manually shut down from a switch located outside the chlorine areas. \n\n\nSection 68.165: Offsite Consequence Analysis.\n\n As a Program 3 Process with one toxic gas, one worst-case release scenario and one alternative release scenario has been assessed for the Chlorination System.  The Charles M Bolton Plant has chosen to use software developed by the USEPA to determine endpoints of a hypothetical chlorine release. RMP Comp software is for facilities storing above a threshold quantity, as a guide to determine off-site consequences.  This software addresses a variety of chemicals, including chlorine.  Therefore, this guidance document is applicable to the Charles M. Bolton PlantA?s chlorination process. The dry scrubber is not considered as a mitigating factor in either scenario. It is assumed the scrubber is not available. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined in accordance with the requirements provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.25(b,c).

      "SummaryText": "n Facility the worst-case scenario is a total release from one of the one-ton containers of chlorine (greatest amount held in a single vessel).  It is assumed that the container ruptures and its entire contents escape to the outside air in 10 minutes.   Additionally, the worst-case scenario requires a ground level release height.  The rate of chlorine release for the worst case scenario is 200 pounds of chlorine per minute.  Using the USEPA RMP Comp software, a toxic endpoint of 3.0 miles was determined for the worst case scenario.  Using LandView 6 (issue date 12/03) the residential population within a 3.0 mile radius of influence for Charles M. Bolton Plant was determined to be approximately 24,716 people.  Also included within this radius are several schools, parks and industrial areas.\nNeither the passive mitigation of the building nor the functions of the scrubber were taken into consideration for this scenario. \n\nThe facility is also required to complete at least one alternative release scenario.  The alternative release scenario was evaluated in accordance with the guidelines provided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 40 CFR 68.28.  The alternative release scenario selected was that of a 3/16 inch diameter opening in a valve, gasket, flexible tubing, or piping occurring inside the enclosed Storage/Unloading Room or Chlorine Feed Room.  This results in a release rate of 3.0 pounds of chlorine per minute for 30 minutes. The USEPA Comp software gives a distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario.  The residential population within a 0.1 mile radius of influence of the CMBP Chlorination System as determined by LandView 6 is approximately zero persons.  The radius of influence does go offsite and includes the East River Road; however it does not encompass any residences, schools, hospitals, parks, or prisons. Neither the passive mitigation of the building nor the functions of the scrubber were taken into consideration for this scenario.\n\n\nSection 68"
