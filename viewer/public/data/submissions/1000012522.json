The 781-acre Marcus Hook Refinery has been in business at the same location since 1901. The refinery can process sweet crude oil obtained primarily from the North Sea and West Africa.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nEthylene Oxide is the only toxic in the Marcus Hook Refinery that meets the threshold quantity specified by the RMP regulation. \n\nFlammables\n\nThe Marcus Hook Refinery has a number of flammables which are in threshold quantities that are specified by the RMP regulation: Hydrogen, Methane, Ethane, Propane, Propylene, Isobutane, Butane, Butene, Isobutene, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, 2-Butene-trans, 1,3-Butadiene, Isopentane, Pentane and Pentene.\n\nThese chemicals are used in one or more of sixteen (16) refinery processes covered by the RMP rule under program level three.  Our accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help us effectively manage the hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment. \n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe centerpiece of Sunoco's accidental release prevention program is Process Safety Management (PSM).  Sunoco has implemented a management system for PSM, which assigns responsibilities to specific individuals. The fourteen (14) elements of PSM, which are outlined below, constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the refinery.  \n\nPSM Prevention Program Elements \n\n     1. Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation is based on the principle that employee involvement in various areas of PSM is key to maintaining a Process Safety sy"

Employees are involved in Health and Safety committee activities, safety meetings, Process Hazard Analysis studies, pre-startup safety reviews, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance training and procedures.\n\n     2. Process Safety Information\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is compiled for each process covered by PSM and is made available to all personnel involved with or affected by that process via an internal computer-based Intranet.  PSI includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.  This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of our PSM program. \n\n     3. Process Hazard Analysis\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are performed by experienced employee teams for each process covered by PSM. Our PHA teams are composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a trained PHA team leader. Studies are conducted according to an established schedule, and each study is updated/revalidated at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes). These comprehensive studies systematically review each unit to identify and assess hazards in the design or operation of the units.  Additional controls are recommended for any unmitigated hazards that are identified. Results of the PHA's are documented in reports that are made available to personnel. \n\n     4. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are developed and implemented for all refinery processes.  The procedures, written by experienced operating personnel and reviewed by a technical committee, describe the detailed steps to carry out the principal modes of "

Procedures are used to (1) train our personnel before they perform tasks in the field, (2) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, (3) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs and (4) provide reference guides in the startup and shutdown of equipment. \n\n     5. Training\n\nEmployees who are responsible for safe operation of the process units are provided with initial training and periodic refresher training.  This training includes a general overview of the process, properties, safety and health hazards of chemicals in the process, as well as a detailed understanding of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Training is conducted using a combination of classroom training, computer-based training, and on-the-job training. Written, verbal and hands-on testing is performed to validate that training requirements have been met.\n\n     6. Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Mechanical Integrity of process equipment is maintained to ensure that the potential for spills and releases is minimized. Programs include an inspection and testing program, a preventive maintenance program, and a quality assurance program.  Procedures describe the methods used to perform inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance tasks of existing process equipment, to verify the proper fabrication and installation of new process equipment, and to properly document all activities. The procedures follow generally accepted engineering practices that employ both industry and company standards. Personnel performing MI activities are trained on the procedures and in the hazards of the process to ensure that job tasks are performed safely. \n\n     7. Management of Change\n\nPermanent or temporary changes can inadvertently introduce new hazards or compromise safeguards built into the original design of a process.

This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The Marcus Hook Refinery uses a computer-based software program to assist in tracking and processing change requests. Results of the Management of Change process are documented and maintained in the software program, and made available to all personnel.         \n\n     8. Pre-startup Safety Review\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews are performed by experienced teams as a final check to ensure the safety of new or modified process facilities before they are placed in service. The review confirms items such as: construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; PHAs have been performed on new processes and all recommendations have been resolved; PSI documentation has been properly updated; MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes; and training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees.\n\n     9. Compliance Audits\n\nThe refinery Process Safety Coordinator is responsible to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM system are being followed. A formal evaluation and certification of the PSM system is conducted at least every three years by a corporate audit team. The compliance audit team seeks to confirm that PSM and RMP practices are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the PSM/RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.

Incident Investigation\n\nAn experienced team promptly investigates incidents that result in, or could reasonably have caused, a catastrophic release, fire or injury.  A systematic investigation process is used to determine the root cause of an event, analyze them and develop solutions to correct the situation and prevent it from recurring.  The investigation team then recommends and implements additional controls in order to mitigate hazards associated with the incident.  Incident causes are tracked, trended and published by the Safety Department.  The published reports are shared with employees and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Sunoco organization.\n\n     11. Hot Work Permit\n\nHot work permits are issued for any work that could create a source of ignition on or near a PSM-covered process unit. The hot work permit program ensures that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near a process. The permit describes work being performed, authorized dates and all fire prevention and protection requirements.       \n\n     12. Contractors\n\nContractors are employed to supplement the refinery's work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. A contractor screening procedure is used to help ensure that contractors are hired who accomplish the desired job tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees, the public, or the environment.  Safety regulations are sent with all bid packages, and an evaluation of the contractor safety record and training program is used in selecting a contracting company.

Emergency Response\n\nOur Emergency Response Plan assures the readiness of employees to respond appropriately and safely to emergencies involving highly hazardous chemicals.  The Emergency Response Plan is an integrated set of actions that start at the incident source, and initiates actions throughout the facility as appropriate.  Additional details about our Emergency Response Program are presented later in this document.\n\n     14. Trade Secrets\n\nOSHA PSM requires the refinery to make available all information necessary to those persons responsible for compiling the process safety information, those assisting in the development of the process hazards analysis, those responsible for developing operating procedures and those involved in incident investigations, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits, without regard to possible trade secret status of such information. Our facility openly provides this necessary information to all responsible persons to comply with these requirements.\n\nThese fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the past five years, we have had two accidents resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under EPA's RMP rule. No offsite consequences occurred due to either incident. We have conducted formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the event and to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The following is a brief summary of the incidents and the investigation results.\n\nOn May 17, 2009, there was a hydrocarbon release and fire on the ethylene unit.  The incident investigation determined the root cause to be crevice corrosion at a pipe support sleeve.  After the initial release, the heat from the fire caused several secondary line failures.  While the effective and timely efforts by emergency responders prevented escalation or injury, the greater part of the unit was not restarted after the fire.\n\nOn June 20, 2009, a release of propane/propylene mix occurred when a loading hose separated from the conne"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nThe Refinery maintains compliance with local, state and federal regulations including OSHA CFR 1910.120, Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Sara Title III and the Refinery Emergency Response Plan. Our Emergency Response programs are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more often if required.  Our programs provide the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Contained in the programs are written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the refinery.  These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies.  The programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\n    \n* Information on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System)\n* Information on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident\n* Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred\n* Procedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel\n* Procedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred\n* Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures\n* Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination\n    \nSeveral methods are available to report an emergency in the refinery including telephones and radios.

Tours and drills with members of these emergency response organizations are held routinely.  These tours and drills enable the public emergency responders to become familiar with the hazards, equipment, resources and personnel in the refinery.\n\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWe are continually striving to make the Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery a safe workplace for our employees, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  For example, we revalidate the Process Hazard Analyses for approximately six (6) process units each year using Layer of Protection Analysis.  These analyses generate additional prevention and mitigation recommendations that result in ongoing modifications to the facility.  In addition to the Process Hazard Analyses recommendations, the following initiatives are currently underway to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n* Alarm Rationalizations to continuously improve console alarm rate\n* Facility siting reviews and modifications\n* Implementation of lessons learned from incident investigations\n* Increased involvement and continuity through Joint Health and Safety Committee initiatives\n\nThe goal of the Sunoco Marcus Hook Refinery is to demonstrate continuous improvement in our health, environmental and safety performance.  In addition, we will work cooperatively with the community to address any concerns.  Should there be any question or comments on the contents of our Risk Management Plan, please contact our Public Relations Representati"
