These substances, whose major components are propane and isobutane, are propellants stored in bulk vessels and used in the process of individual canisters.\n\nFor each of these substances, Penn Champ must comply with the following major requirements of Section112r of the Clean Air Act:\n\n     - Management System development and documentation,\n     - Hazard Assessment for each affected process,\n     - Prevention Program completion,\n     - Emergency Response Program coordination, and\n     - Risk Management Plan submittal.\n\nIn addition, Penn Champ recognizes its responsibility under Section 112r(1) (the \"general duty clause\") to safely handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances (regardless of the quantities), to prevent their accidental release, and to minimize the consequences of any such release.  Additional chemicals on site, not meeting their TQ or not indentified in the 112r list rule, are managed using risk-management principles similar to those applied to our chemicals fully covered by 112r.\n\nThis Executive Summary of Penn Champ's Risk Management Plan (RMP) provides an overview of how we are effectively meeting our responsibilities to the community through compliance with the 112r rule.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nPenn Champ has established a management system to oversee the implementation of its Risk Management Program responsibilities.  The management system is designed to help ensure that each element of our program is fully and effectively completed.  A qualified person has been assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the program elements.  Responsibility for impl"

The probability that a worst-case release might occur or the possible causes of such a release are not considered.\n\n- The alternative scenario involves an accidental release that is \"more likely to occur\" than the worst-case release scenario.   Scenarios to consider include transfer hose splits or uncoupling, process piping failures, process vessel or pump cracks and failures, vessel overfilling and spill or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks, and shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\n- We assumed a complete rupture and content loss of the largest quantity vessel.  The rupture results in a vapor cloud explosion.  As required by the regulation, a 1 psi overpressure criteria was used in estimating the endpoint distance.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n\n- We assumed a process piping shear and content loss of 10,600 gallons.  An operator is assumed to isolate the system in 5  minutes.  The scenario assumes a two-phase release.  The rupture results in a vapor cloud explosion.  A 1 psi overpressure endpoint was used in estimating the endpoint distance.\n\nThe OCA of each potential chemical release was analyzed using appropriate air dispersion analysis and modeling techniques.  Air dispersion modeling is the use of a computer to simulate the spread of air pollutants.  Dispersion modeling can be used to determin"

This document was developed for the propane storage industry and provides guidance on the estimates of potential release scenarios and the calculation of release quantities and endpoints.\n\nEPA OCA Guide is the EPA's Offisite Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996) that provides rough estimates of offsite impacts from evaporating pools of chemicals and vapor cloud explosions.\n\nRMP*Comp software is based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP Offiste Consequence Analysis Guidance (May 1996):  that provides rough estimates of offsite impacts from evaporating pools of chemicals and vapor clouds.\n\nThe estimated population within the worst-case release circle is 1,000, while the estimated population within the alternative release circle is estimated at 900.\n\nModeling Limitations and Assumptions\n\nAir-dispersion models are limited in their ability to accurately predict the impact of a chemical release.  Their limitations increase as the complexity of the topography surrounding the release site increases.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Prevention Program helps to ensure that regulated substances are safely stored, used, and handled.  In addition, if a chemical release occurs, the Prevention Program ensures that procedures and equipment are established to detect and mitigate the impact of such a release.\n\nSafeguarding the public from accidental releases through an effective Prevention Program is an importa"
