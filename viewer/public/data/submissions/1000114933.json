      "SummaryText": "Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA) operates the Airport Treatment Plant located on Aviation Boulevard near the town of Windsor, Sonoma County, California. This facility is a wastewater treatment plant that is covered by the California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) program and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations because it has chlorine onsite in excess of the RMP threshold quantity (TQ).\n\nIt is SCWA's policy to comply with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulatory requirements. SCWA employees, supervisors and managers are all responsible for complying with these regulations. Agency employees and managers are provided with training to familiarize them with their requirements and responsibilities.\n\nSCWA has developed a process safety and risk management program that documents the policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases. In addition, SCWA has conducted technical studies such as Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) and Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCAs) to identify and evaluate potential hazards associated with the use of chlorine at the Airport Treatment Plant. SCWA has emergency procedures and an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), and these are coordinated with County of Sonoma Fire Prevention & Haz Mat Division.\n\nA management system is in place for implementing the RMP and Cal-ARP regulations. This system defines the scope and purpose for each program element, procedures for implementation, roles and responsibilities, and the record-keeping requirements. The SCWA Risk & Safety Officer has responsibility to coordinate the implementation of the risk management program. Delegated responsibilities are outlined in the SCWA's written programs.\n\nAt the Airport Treatment Plant, chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process for odor control and disinfection. Chlorine is supplied in one-ton containers, which are stored inside a chlorine building. The room has capacity to store five one-ton containers of chlorine (10,000 pounds). Administrative c"

      "SummaryText": "ontrols are in place to ensure that the maximum number of containers never exceeds this number.\n\nIn addition to the chlorine containers, the chlorination system includes vacuum regulators, chlorinators and chlorine injectors, all connected by industry-standard pvc piping. The chlorine flow rate is set at the chlorinator to dose the correct amount of chlorine at the point of application. The design is inherently safe with the vacuum regulator placed directly on the ton container. This means that if there is any damage to the piping system downstream there will be a break in the vacuum, and the chlorine flow will be stopped at the regulator.\n\nAll chlorine equipment is housed inside the chlorine building. Leak detectors have been installed to monitor for chlorine leaks. If chlorine is detected, it triggers a local alarm and relays an alarm signal to the SCWA's Operations Center in Santa Rosa. The detector also activates a scrubber system, installed in 2013.\n\nIn developing the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), the approach taken was to follow the overall guidance provided by EPA in the Model RMP for Wastewater Treatment Plants. This model plan was used to help select the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, and to evaluate the hazard distances for both scenarios. EPA's Landview program was used to estimate the population that would be affected by a release. Details of the OCA methodologies and the OCA results are included in reports held by SCWA in Santa Rosa.\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents involving chlorine that resulted in any off-site impacts, and there have been no serious injuries or fatalities on-site.\n\nSCWA has implemented a comprehensive prevention program to minimize the potential for a catastrophic release of chlorine at the Airport Treatment Plant. Process Safety Information is available to employees, and Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted. External events were considered in the PHAs, and a seismic asses"

Following any system modifications, a pre-startup safety review procedure needs to be followed.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been developed for normal and emergency operations. The SOPs provide written operating instructions for operating the chlorine system, and they include procedures for container deliveries and container change-outs. Equipment inspections, testing and maintenance activities are performed on a routine basis and documented in a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).  All operators are state-certified treatment operators, and all operators and mechanics are required to be trained in the SOPs for the chlorine system.\n\nCompliance audits have been conducted for the risk management program to verify compliance with the Cal-ARP and RMP regulations. SCWA has a procedure to investigate any incident or accident that results in the release of a reportable quantity of chlorine. Incident investigation procedures include root cause analysis.\n\nSCWA operators and mechanics are trained at the first responder awareness level under the HAZWOPER standard for emergency response and only respond to incidental releases. Guidance is provided to all operators and mechanics to help them distinguish between an incidental release and an emergency. In the event of an emergency, the procedures are to notify the response agencies, evacuate to a safe area, and assess the cause of the release, if this can be done safely. The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the local response agencies, and SCWA will cooperate with these agencies to coordinate any off-site response that may be required in an emergency.\n\nFollowing each PHA revalidation, SCWA implements recommendations to improve safety.

Progress on the implementation of these recommendations (and others developed in MOC reviews and compliance audits) is followed in an action tracking system coordinated by the Risk & Safety Officer. SCWA is continually looking at new technologies to improve safety and to reduce or eliminate the use of chlorine gas. In fact, this plant is in the process of transferring wastewater operations to a nearby entity that does not use chlorine or toxic gas chemicals for treatment of wastewater. Therefore, SCWA plans to submit a de-registration for this plant within the coming year (estimated by August of 2024).\n\nIn summary, the design of the chlorine system at the SCWA Airport Treatment Plant, and the implementation of the safety and risk management programs provide a high level of assurance that the risks associated with the use of chlorine are being effectively managed."
