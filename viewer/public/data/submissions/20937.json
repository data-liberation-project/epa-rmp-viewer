      "SummaryText": "Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville is a poultry processing facility that stores and uses one chemical that is regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  This chemical is ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacities of 12,000 pounds of Ammonia.\n\nWayne Farms LLC-Albertville believes that this RMP chemical that we store and handle on site hads very real potential dangers.  However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective. Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville's ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audit, and \n5. are constantly upgrading our processes to meet or exceed industry standards.  \n\nWayne Farms LLC-Albertville also has taken a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with Marshall County EMA Fire Department.  Marshall EMA has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to the potential spills and leaks that may occur at the Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville Facility.  Albertville Fire Department conducts annual site visits and training at our facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards, such as Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville, provides less public risk than a facility that does not provide safe operations.  Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville complies with Federal OSHA rules and guidelines for safe handling and operation of ammonia and utilizes outside system experts to periodically inspect system integrity and train system operators.  As a result of Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville's safety program, Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville has had only one minor release of approximately 30-40 lbs of ammonia in 1996 with an incident of exposure effecting two employees who were evaluated by a physician and released without inpatient treatment.\n\nBecause of the large quantity of ammonia Wayne Farms"

      "SummaryText": " LLC-Albertville stores on-site, there is a very small probability that there could be off-site consequences if a major leak occurred.  Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville used EPA's OCA Guidance to develop a model for off-site conseqauence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (12,000 pounds in 10-minutes), a .6 mile radius around the Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville facility may have to be notified and possibly evacuated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 726 people in the surrounding community shoud be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nA 500 pound release was used to determine an alternative-release scenario, which would result in a release of ammonia that could  travel .1 miles and could, according to 1990 Census Data, require 10 people in the surrounding community to be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform the public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms LLC has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC-Albertville has a great ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Marshall County."
