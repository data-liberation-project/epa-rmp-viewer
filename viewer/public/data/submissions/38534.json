      "SummaryText": "\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are two commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) Los Coyotes Water Reclamation Plant (LCWRP) uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, LCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  LCWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in c! ! Ase of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results. (Optional for 2004 RMP Update)\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the LCWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County LCWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system prac"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe CSDLAC emergency response policy involves the preparation of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCP) for handling hazardous materials which are specific for each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the LCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency (County of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The LCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe LCWRP is located at 16515 Piuma Avenue, in Cerritos, California.  The treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 34 acres, bounded on the south side by the Artesia (91) Freeway, on the east side by the San Gabriel River Valley (605) Freeway, on the north and west sides by Cerritos Iron Wood Nine Golf Course.  The CSDLAC has operated LCWRP facility since 1970.  The design treatment capacity of the plant is currently 37.5 million gal of wastewater per day (mgd).  The wastewater treated at LCWRP originates mainly from approximately 350,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the step feed/aeration activated sludge process with post-chlorination and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent for purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination at LCWRP is received in chlor"

Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also received at LCWRP in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the building. The chlorination system consists of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway and at the end of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer.  There are emergency shutdown switches located at each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  All emergency shutdown valves can also be activated from the Plant Central Room.\n\nChlorine gas detectors are used to sense chlorine leaks in the bulk storage and chlorination rooms.  Upon detection of approximately 1 ppmv chlorine, the detectors will send a signal, which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorination and storage rooms.  The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system consists of two sulfur dioxide bulk storage tanks, evaporators, sulfonators, residual analyzer, ejectors, diffusers, piping and other equipment.  In addition to the main dechlorination system, there is a separate system with sulfonators for dechlorinating the waste filter backwash water.

Upon detection of approximately 5 ppmv sulfur dioxide, the detectors will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the gas within the storage room.  The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide scrubber system is equipped with an emergency generator set.  The emergency generator will automatically start one second after the loss of regular power and will continue to run for 5 minutes after regular power is restored.  The emergency generator powers the entire scrubbing system including alarms, the scrubber fan, caustic recirculation pumps, electrically-operated valves, and the sump pump.  The generator also powers portions of the chlorine and sulfur systems including the automatic shutoff valve system (including the air compressors), lighting in both areas as well as lighting in the scrubber area, gas detectors, and the building ventilation fans.\n\nThe plant is manned 24 hours per day, year-round.  Access to LCWRP is through a main gate, which is closed after regular hours. In addition, a closed-circuit TV is provided on the main gate.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ? maximum quantity in the largest vessel ? is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

For the worst-case release scenario analysis for the LCWRP, two scenarios were considered: (1) rupture of one chlorine tank with maximum capacity, resulting in a release of all chlorine over a 10-minute duration, (2) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with maximum capacity, resulting in a release of all sulfur dioxide over a 10-minute duration.  Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of both the chlorine bulk tank and the sulfur dioxide tank. The release rate reduction from the enclosed building is estimated to be approximately 82% reduction of the release rate from the bulk tank, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies levels for buildings storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The release rates for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were thus estimated.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine/sulfur dioxide is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (108 deg F), and average relative humidity ("

The results of the air dispersion analysis indicated that the toxic endpoint distance would be longer for the release of sulfur dioxide in comparison to chlorine release.  However, worst-case release for both chemicals have offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.  Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the LCWRP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nTwo alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenarios selected for the LCWRP chlorination and dechlorination involve the release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the monel flexible hose connecting the storage tanks to chlorination and dechlorination processes.  These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the storage tanks.

The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide monitors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination facility.  It is assumed that a maximum of sixty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remote controlled shutoff valves installed on the flex hoses.\n\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 87 lb./min.  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.003 lb/min. The sulfur dioxide release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 56 lb/min.  However, the sulfur dioxide release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.01 lb/min.  Since the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPA's SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 61 deg F, and average humidity of 74%.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one hour average concentration for both regulated substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) would be less than 0.1 ppm (0.01 ppm for chlorine and 0.03 ppm for sulfur diox! ! ide).  These concentrations are significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of these scenarios is highly unlikely because the flex hoses are inspected and pressure tested every two years.\n\nFinally, no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the LCWRP during the"

LCWRP uses a permitting program to ensure hot work is conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nCSDLAC provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, p"

This system allows CSDLAC staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The process involves CSDLAC assembling an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nCSDLAC investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the LCWRP during the last five years (since 1994).\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nLCWRP-trained operators are first responders to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak alarms and accidental releases.

      "SummaryText": "on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department will be called to aid in handling a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  As part of the emergency response program, the CSDLAC has developed and implemented a Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plan for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.\n\nHMHWCC has been coordinated with the local response agency (Los Angeles County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with Local Governments, Incident Commanders, (4) incident action plan, including mitigation actions, response resources, (5) implementation of tactical plan, and (6) termination and follow-up actions.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the two covered processes in 1992 as part of the PHAs conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP).  The PHAs were reviewed in 1997 under the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required.  In addition, the process hazard analyses for the two covered processes were further reviewed in 1999 and 2004 under the RMP and CalARP requirements.  Based on this review, additional changes were identified to further improve the safety of chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated by December 2004.  The implementation of these recommendations will further improve the safety of the chlorination and dechlorination systems."
