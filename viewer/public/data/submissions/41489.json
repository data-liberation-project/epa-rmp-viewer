Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), part 68.  \n\nFoster Farms Dairy prepared this RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. Foster Farms Dairy has incorporated state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as part of system modifications and upgrades.  Foster Farms Dairy will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP. \n\nThe Foster Farms Dairy at 415 Kansas Avenue in Modesto, California is located in an area zoned for commercial and industrial use.  The facility is near Highway 99, which runs north and south through Modesto.  Foster Farms Dairy is a family owned business that processes milk into fluid milk, powdered milk, and butter and packages fruit juices.  Foster Farms Dairy purchased the facility in 1988. Knudsen formerly owned the facility.  The facility has undergone significant modifications since 1988 and the majority of the ammonia refrigeration system components are less than 12 years old."

      "SummaryText": "Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in two refrigeration systems (\u00bfA\u00bf and \u00bfB\u00bf).  Each system contains approximately 16,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia refrigeration systems are closed systems.  The refrigeration systems provide cooling to the cold storage rooms, milk silos, glycol chillers, and air conditioning systems.  The cold rooms are used to store product. Some of the \u00bfA\u00bf side milk silos are jacketed with ammonia coils and store refrigerated milk and fruit juice concentrate.  The glycol chillers supply cooled liquid to processing units and other equipment for refrigeration of raw materials.  The \u00bfA\u00bf system provides refrigeration for the liquid products operations.  The \u00bfB\u00bf system provides refrigeration for powdered processing and other operations.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms Dairy has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms Dairy ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  Further, the systems are equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and most, if not all, locations within the ammonia system where ammonia could become trapped.  These pressure relief valves are manifolded to a water-filled diffusion tank.  Any ammonia vapor that is unintentionally released through pressure relief valves bubbles through water that absorbs the ammonia.  Other safety features at the facility include: \n\u00b7central computer monitoring and control system\n\u00b7emergency shutdown systems \n\u00b7component specific safety shutdowns th"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and emergency responders, a hot work permit program, a lock-out/tag-out program, a contractor safety program, and a management of change program.  Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been written for the ammonia systems at the facility and will provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\n\nFoster Farms Dairy is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the ammonia refrigeration systems.  A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration systems.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly and periodic inspection, calibration, testing and overhaul of ammonia system equipment.

The Foster Farms Dairy facility at 415 Kansas Avenue reported three accidental releases of ammonia within the past five years: August 2004, August 2000 and September 2000.  Foster Farms personnel mitigated all releases.  The local fire department and county hazmat team provided backup support during the incidents.  \nThe August 2000 release resulted from a failed manhole gasket on FES Compressor #4B. Ammonia vapor was released through the failed gasket.  No off-site impact occurred and no injuries were reported.  The facility has since implemented a program to verify compressor manhole gasket installations.  \n\nA piping tie-in to a valve was the cause of the September 2000 release. Ammonia liquid was released through the valve.  No off-site impact occurred and no injuries were reported.  The facility has since implemented a program to verify valves cannot be opened after being chain closed.\n\nThe July 2004 release resulted from a failed \u00bd inch nipple. Ammonia vapor was released through the broken nipple. Two minor injuries were reported as a result of the release one required no medical treatment and the other was transported to the hospital and released after observation. The facility has since replaced the defective nipple and inspected other similar nipples and found them to be safe. \n\nIn the unlikely event that an ammonia release that requires emergency response occurs at the facility, Foster Farms Dairy has trained refrigeration system operators for emergency response.  Each operator receives 40 hours of emergency response training consistent with the California Safety Training Institute (CSTI) curriculum, presented by a CSTI certified instructor.  The facility has a written emergency response program that identifies the roles, responsibilities and actions of the emergency responders.
