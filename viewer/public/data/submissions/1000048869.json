To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, PFG Springfield MA facility is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6.2.6 The emergency response program\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. PFG Springfield MA facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. PFG Springfield MA facility conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n6.2.7 Planned changes to improve safety\n\nPFG Springfield MA facility is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows PFG Springfield MA facility to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of PFG Springfield MA facility employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
