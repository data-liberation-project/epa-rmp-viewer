This Risk Management Plan summarizes the managerial, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan definitions and requirements:\n\n* Introduction\n* Elf Atochem's Policies to Protect Health, Environmental, and Safety\n* Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n* Hazard Assessment\n* Prevention Program\n* Five-Year Accident History\n* Emergency Response Plan\n\nELF ATOCHEM POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nElf Atochem is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the Beaumont plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer.  Senior Management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters. This emphasis on safety is carried on at all levels of the plant.  The Beaumont plant has a safety committee that meets monthly to discuss HES topics.  The success of the plant's HES program is also demonstrated by a strong commitment to safety by our employees and site contractors.\n\nElf Atochem's HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materials to ensure our commitment to health, environment, and safety.  These materials include Risk Managem"

This facility manufactures Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan.  Methyl Mercaptan is used to produce photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and Methionine, a synthetic amino acid used in animal feed supplement.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability and for the Beaumont plant include:\n\nToxics\nMethyl Mercaptan        74-93-1\nHydrogen Sulfide        7783-06-4\nCarbon Disulfide        75-15-0\n\nFlammables\n\nEthyl Mercaptan        75-08-1\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic failure of the Methyl Mercaptan storage tank.   Methyl Mercaptan is stored as a liquid in the storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Methyl Mercaptan stored to 90% of the tank liquid capacity. This quantity ( 1,300,000 pounds ) is assumed to be released over a ten minute time period and that the entire quantity is released as a vapor.  \n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions, the release could produce a Methyl Mercaptan vapor plume that could travel up to 19 (EPA Look-up Table) miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and the environment.  It should be noted that the worst case scenario is recognized by the regulatory agency and Elf Atochem as an extremely unlikely event. It is noted that the worst case scenario is a"

It is stored as a liquid.  Administrative controls limit the quantity  of Ethyl Mercaptan stored to 90% of the tank liquid capacity.  This quantity ( 2,000,000 pounds ) is assumed to be released over a 10 minute time period as a vapor.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions , the potentially affected area is a maximum distance of 0.90 (EPA Look-up Table) miles which corresponds to end point distance of a 1 psi overpressure.  Again, it is noted that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and Elf Atochem has implemented mitigation and prevention programs to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident from occurring.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE MITIGATION MEASURES\n\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures in use at the Beaumont plant make it very unlikely that a significant release involving Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan will occur.  In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Elf Atochem has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community.  \n\nIn accordance with the guidelines used to define worst case incidents, active mitigation measures were not considered in modeling the worst case scenarios.  However, the significant mitigation measures implemented at the Beaumont plant will  effectively reduce the risk and consequences associated with a RMP worst case incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress             vapor.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n\n* Member of area Mutua"

This scenario involves the release of 12,900 pounds of Methyl Mercaptan.  Under atmospheric stability class D, conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 0.30 miles based on a 60 minute release.  This distance provides for material to disperse sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. \n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - HYDROGEN SULFIDE\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance ( 56% Hydrogen Sulfide mixture) involves a 1 inch leak in the piping between the Methyl Mercaptan reactor and Reactor effluent product separator. This scenario involves the release of 15,500 pounds of Hydrogen Sulfide.  Under atmospheric stability class D conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 0.30 miles based on a 60 minute release.  This distance provides for material to disperse sufficiently to no longer pose a hazard to the public or environmental receptors. \n\n\n\n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - CARBON DISULFIDE\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance ( Carbon Disulfide ) involves a 1 ? inch transfer hose leak at the Carbon Disulfide Unloading Station from the piping system to the Storage Tank.  This scenario involves the release of 11,810 pounds of Carbon Disulfide.  Under atmospheric stability class D conditions the vapor plume was estimated to travel 0.20 miles based on a 10 minute response by employees to operate the Emergency Shutdown System and to isolate and depressure line.
