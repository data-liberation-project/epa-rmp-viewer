Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five-year period, the West Deptford facility has experienced one accident from a covered process that resulted in an OSHA lost-time injury. The accident was a chemical contact incident with a HF-containing waste stream.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is designed to assure that West Deptford facility employees are prepared to respond to emergency situations which may occur at the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Program involves the following elements:\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan: The West Deptford facility maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning. The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. The plan includes instructions for: emergency reporting and plan activation, notification of emergency responders, emergency shutdown procedures, establishment of an emergency command center and field command post, duties of key individuals, procedures for fire, chemical release, off-site spills, hurricane, and bomb threat, evacuation procedures, HAZMAT procedures, and emergency response equipment information.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Pl"
