Splash Pool Chemicals has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1984.\n\nSplash Pool Chemicals' president is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The president administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Action Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe process is located at 3144 East 46th Street, Tucson, Arizona  85713.  The chlorine transfer process for Splash Pool Chemicals of Arizona, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 12000 pounds.\n\nThere are three full time employees on site; however, there are seven additional employees that pick up supplies in the morning and are on the road all day.  They may stop back at the end of the day to unload the vehicle.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nSplash Pool Chemicals of Arizona, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine. Splash Pool Chemicals of Arizona, Inc. does not use any outside contractors at the facility; therefore, they do not have a contractor safety program in place.  In the event that they need to use outside contractors, a safety program will be prepared and implemented at that time.   In addition, common"

      "SummaryText": " industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nAll employees must complete a safety training program which includes materials published by the National Association of Gas Chlorinators and The Chlorine Institute.  Only employees who have completed training certification for \"Level 2 Technician\" status may transfer chlorine to 20 pound cylinders.  Additional safety equipment on site includes a ton container cradle device which allows ton containers to be rotated in place to assist in inspection and repair if ever needed.  \n\nThe facility produces no hazardous wastes.  Every chemical by-product from the transfer process is reclaimed and used in swimming pool water treatment allowing no environmental wastes.  This business eliminates our customers' need to buy, transport, handle, and dispose of hazardous materials required for swimming pool water treatment. This provides a major benefit to the environment.  \n\nNo firefighters, police, or emergency response personnel have ever had to respond to a hazardous material release from this facility.  No firefighters, police, or emergency response personnel have ever been injured or hospitalized from a chlorine release from this facility or on the job site.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nSplash Pool Chemicals of Arizona, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with the Rural Metro Fire Department.  This plan outlines the personnel to contact in the event of a release.  The facility plans to contact 9-1-1 in the event of a chlorine release and evacuate all employees.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSplash Pool Chemicals has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (Juen 20"
