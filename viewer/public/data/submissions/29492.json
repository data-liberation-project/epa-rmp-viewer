HCl has been included in the RMP under the General Duty clause because it is generated when TiCl4 reacts with water.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Ferro facility maintains this RMP in accordance with Section 112(r) of the CAA in addition to a Spill Prevention Report in accordance with New York State\u00bfs Chemical Bulk Storage (CBS) regulations (6 NYCRR Parts 595-599). Both of these documents include accidental release prevention provisions for the TiCl4 process at the facility. Additionally, the Ferro facility maintains a Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan which includes provisions for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of TiCl4.\n\nFERRO FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nThe Ferro facility stores up to 5,000 gallons (72,350 pounds) of liquid TiCl4 in one 5,000 gallon aboveground storage tank, which exceeds the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds specified in the 112(r) rule. The TiCl4 is used to provide titanium for the ceramic manufacturing process. In accordance with the CAA General Duty clause, Ferro has identified an additional potential for exposure due to the reactive nature of TiCl4 with water. Ferro is upgrading its program level from Program 1 to Program 2 to account for the potential generation of HCl gas from a TiCl4 release. HCl is not a chemical used by Ferro in a regulated process, but is strictl"

      "SummaryText": "y a product of reaction of TiCl4 with the moisture in the air.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case release scenario consists of an instantaneous release of the entire maximum contents (up to 72,350 pounds) of the TiCl4 tank into the existing concrete dike secondary containment area with a surface area of approximately 372 square feet.  Assessment of the worst case scenario allows inclusion of passive mitigation systems such as the concrete dike, but does not allow inclusion of active mitigation systems such as Ferro\u00bfs foam suppression system.  \n\nTiCl4 is highly reactive with water and generates HCl when contacting the moisture in air.  The worst case release assumes that the TiCl4 volatilizing from the surface of the contained liquid instantaneously reacts with moisture in air to generate HCl gas.  The rate of generation of the HCl gas was determined from the modeled volatilization rate of TiCl4 and the stoichiometry of the reaction of TiCl4 with water.  Results of the previously submitted Chemical Manufacturer\u00bfs Association (CMA) TiCl4 Dispersion Modeling System (as included in the original RMP submittal) were used to estimate the HCl generation rate.  It should be noted that HCl is not a chemical used in a process at the Ferro facility and is being included in this RMP under the General Duty clause.  Air dispersion modeling using the estimated HCl generation rate and the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software indicated that the distance to the HCl toxic endpoint was 0.19 miles (1,023 feet).  This results in an estimated off-site impact since the distance to the fenceline from the TiCl4 storage tank is approximately 300 feet.  Again, assessment of the worst case scenario does not allow for inclusion of the active mitigation system (foam suppression).  It is likely that the foam suppression system would reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint even further; thereby further reducing the potential for off-site impacts.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE"

      "SummaryText": "SCENARIOS\n\nMultiple alternative release scenarios were evaluated to assess if other more likely events would potentially cause an off-site impact.  Of the alternatives evaluated, two are presented in the RMP.  The first alternative release scenario was selected since it appeared as the worst case scenario in the previous RMP submittal.  The second alternative release scenario was selected because it predicted the greatest distance to toxic endpoint out of all other scenarios evaluated.\n\nThe first alternative release scenario included in the RMP is the previous RMP\u00bfs worst case scenario \u00bf the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the TiCl4 tank into the secondary containment area.  This alternative release scenario evaluates the distance to the toxic endpoint for TiCl4 rather than for HCl.  The CMA TiCl4 Dispersion Modeling System indicated that the distance to toxic endpoint for TiCl4 under this scenario is 39 feet which is less than the distance to the fenceline (approximately 300 feet).  Therefore, no off-site impact is predicted for this release scenario.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario included in the RMP is the release of TiCl4 from a breach in the transfer line during filling of the storage tank, resulting in formation of a liquid puddle of TiCl4 inside the secondary containment area that is suppressed within 5 minutes using foam.  The ALOHA dispersion model indicated that the distance to the HCl toxic endpoint under this scenario is 369 feet.  There were no public or environmental receptors identified within this radius for this release scenario.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe TiCl4 process at the Ferro facility is in compliance with Section 112(r) of the CAA and the New York State CBS regulations. Chemical-specific prevention steps are included in the facility\u00bfs CBS Spill Prevention Report.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Ferro facility has not experienced any accidental releases of TiCl4 in the past five years (Janu"

The Plan has been coordinated with local emergency response agencies, including the State Emergency Response Commission. The Plan also includes provisions for public notification in the event of a release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Ferro facility currently has no planned changes associated with improving safety. In the recent past, Ferro installed a foam suppression system at the TiCl4 storage tank dike area to provide additional protection against off-site migration of HCl gas."
