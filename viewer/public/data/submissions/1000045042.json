Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe plan has been upgraded from the original risk management plan required of 1999 to further include safety information, operating procedures, training, maintenance, incident investigation, complaint audits and emergency action in order to protect employees and property.  It also includes steps taken to reduce the risk of hazardous material release.\r\n\r\n3.\tFacility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and is distributed for direct application as a crop nutrient.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 130,850 pounds in the facilityA\u00bfs 12,000 gallon and two 8,000 gallon storage tanks filled to 85% capacity.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the larger storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the larger storage tank.  This was calculated by multiplying the water capacity of the storage tank by 4.6732, which represents the pounds of ammonia per gallon of water tank capacity.  The distance to the dispersion endpoint based on the DEGADIS Model is 0.84 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative-Case Release Scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a 2A\u00bf transfer hose, with 11,908"

      "SummaryText": "pounds released over 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is 0.56 miles.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to The Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers and Storage Facilities.  These regulations are administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site.  To our knowledge, there have been no accidental releases that have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written action plan in accordance with OSHA standard CFR 1910.38 and provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and committee right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III of EPCRA.  Our emergency action plan has been reviewed with the local fire department and provided to the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning.\r\n\r\n8.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
