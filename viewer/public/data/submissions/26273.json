Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Berne Co-op Association, Ida Grove, IA (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department,or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia as a crop production nutrient to local area farmers. It is stored in: one (1) - 30,000 gallon (about 131,300 pounds) steel, pressurized storage tank; one (1) - 26,000 gallon (about 113,800 pounds) steel, pressurized storage tank and 32 - 1,000 gallon (about 140,100 pounds) steel, pressuirized nurse tanks. The maximum total storage quantity would be about 385,200 pounds.\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of ten (10) minutes. The maximum quantity released would be about 131,300 pounds, the contents of the largest storage tank (30,000 gallons) at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 1.1 miles. B) The Alternative Case Release Scenario,based on the five year accident history, or the most likely incident, is the release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose followed by the release of ammonia for two (2) minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes to stop the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is estimated to be about 0.8miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has b"

The standrad of the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), K-61.1, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" has been adopted by reference by the Iowa Administrative Code (IAC), Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200).\n\n5. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has: A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required by SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n6. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deathsm injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor, to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
