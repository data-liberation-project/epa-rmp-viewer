      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the plant consist of all regulations that are regulated by OSHA and the PSM program at the facility.  All refrigeration employees and numerous supervisors are trained in the 40 HAZMAT course to respond to accidental releases.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all the SOP's from the PSM program.  These procedures are reviewed yearly to help insure that all problems are corrected.  All refrigeration maintenance personnel are currently scheduled to go through refrigeration school to teach them the operations and safety.  The school is located in Grayson, Kentucky and is part of the local community college.  The preventative maintenance program is periodically reviewed and updated as the monitoring and repair on equipment is performed.  This process has been of great benefit to the plant in finding problems in a timely manner.\n\nThe Cook Family Foods plant in Grayson, Kentucky, is a pork processing and packaging facility.  The plant is defined by the EPA as a \"Meat Cutter\" facility.  Final products produced include: meat products and meat and bone meal.  The regulated substance used at this facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process.  Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of the meat and meat products.  \n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario for this facility is a rupture in the receiver resulting in a loss of the entire contents of 19,870 pounds of ammonia.  This loss will occur within 10 minutes and the spilled liquid will vaporize at room temperature releasing gas to the atmosphere.  The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has determined that the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which c"

Under the worst-case weather conditions with dispersion into an urban area, the toxic cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia would reach offsite endpoint and nearby public receptors.  A release of this magnitude is very unlikely due to the safety measures and PSM programs at the facility.\n\nThe alternative or more likely release scenario would occur as a result of a relief/rupture disk failure.  This would result in the release of approximately 2000 pounds in a period of 300 minutes to creat an exposure level of 200 ppm at the property line of the facility.  The release would not affect any populations.\n\nThe Cook Family Foods facility is in compliance with all OSHA PSM rules and this RMP rule requirements.  The procedural and managerial steps that are in place are a preventative measure to accidental release prevention as well as maintenance and training programs that are in place.  The facility is also in compliance with  the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standard number 58 as well as other safe engineering practices on propane.\n\nThere have been no releases at this facility in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or property damage on site or in death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage offsite.\n\nThe Cook Family Foods facility has an emergency response plan on file with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).  The facilities HAZMAT team conducts regular drills and training of specialized personnel and the local fire department personnel.  The policies for reporting spills and releases is documented in the \"Policies and Procedures\" manual updated by the Corporate Environmental Operations office.\n\nThe engine rooms of this facility are protected by local alarm systems.
