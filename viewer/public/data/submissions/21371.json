If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the\nNora Springs Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substance handled.  This facility is a country grain elevator.\nWe supply fertilizer products for sale to the agriculture community.  We use anhydrous ammonia as a nitrogen source in crop production management practices.  Our company currently has a 34,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of our 34,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 5.6 miles.  There are private homes, schools and offices within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 10,344 people.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicalbe state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with state laws.\n\nFive-year accident history.  We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the Nora Springs Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.  None"
