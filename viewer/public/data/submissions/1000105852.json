These procedures are used by all personnel involved in both user and non-user maintenance activities.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe site's management of change program is intended to review and evaluate changes to process chemistry, operating conditions or limits, equipment, and procedures before changes are made so as to prevent unexpected adverse impacts. The management of change program uses a quantitative risk assessment to determine the significance of the change. This risk level assessment determines the levels of authorization required to approve the action. Design review checklists are used to evaluate different types of changes to prevent new hazards being created or equipment changes which are not suited to the service as it exists in the process. Another feature of the management of change program is that it verifies and documents that procedures, records, and equipment information are updated and that personnel affected by the change are informed of and trained in the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAll incidents that result in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a release of a hazardous material, a fire or explosion in a covered process area, major property damage, adverse environmental impact, or serious personal injury be reported and promptly investigated. By investigating accidents and near misses, important lessons are learned. Corrective actions can then be implemented to prevent similar events in the future. Incident investigations are documented, and recommendations tracked to their completion. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years to facilitate their use during PHA updates and revalidation.  \n\nCompliance Audits\nTo assure that the goals of the accident prevention programs are met, program performance is periodically evaluated in the form of compliance audits.

      "SummaryText": "r week. Products manufactured at the facility are carried out in three reactor vessels especially suited for this type of operation. The finished products are water-based surfactants with highly efficient dispersant properties. Specific applications include agricultural product formulations to retard sedimentation of water dispersible granules such as herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. In the same unit, formaldehyde is diluted in water to a concentration less than 1% and blended with another water-based surfactant to abate an unusually strong odor.\n\nThere is one EPA RMP regulated toxic chemical used at the facility. Formaldehyde is the only RMP regulated toxic material present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity. No regulated flammables, above threshold quantities, are present at the facility. The facility is regulated under Level 2 RMP requirements as it is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119, and the covered RMP process does not fall under the prescriptive North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes listed in Section 68.10i of the RMP regulation.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Nouryon Surface Chemistry, LLC. These high standards include:\n\u2022 Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u2022 Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u2022 Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u2022 Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\nIn addition, the following specific prevention programs are in place:\n\nEmployee Participation\nThe employees and management work together to manage process safety and accident prevention e"
