If an emergency were to occur, it is the Facility's policy to contact the Oregon Ohio Fire and Rescue and the Lucas County Emergency Management Agency, as appropriate, through the 911 Service.  Medical emergencies will require notification of Oregon Ohio Fire and Rescue (aero-medical is available through \"ProMedica Aero Medical Services\"). The primary hospital response is provided through St. Charles Hospital (St. Vincent Hospital is nearest Trauma Center). The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Buckeye Pipe Line Company, L.P. - Toledo Station Butane Blending System is a refined product distribution pipe line facility, including the butane blending system (direct injection into the gasoline pipe lines). The Risk Management Plan covers the butane blending system including two horizontal storage vessels, the associated piping, two injection skids, five sample analyzers along with gasoline fast loops, and two truck offloading points.\n\n\n\nThe Facility's worst case scenario is the complete failure of one liquefied butane vessel filled to 85% capacity (automatic shut-off limited) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site and includes both public and limited environmental receptors. The Facility's alternate (potential to impact off-site populations) scenario is a BLEVE involving a single storage vessel.

Additionally, this plan meets the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor- Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management regulations (inclusive of all 14 elements) for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR Part 1910.119).\n\n\n\nThis Facility has never had an accident or incident involving the butane blending system resulting in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Toledo Station butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Oregon Ohio Fire and Rescue and request their assistance. The Facility's Emergency Response Action Plan is coordinated with the Oregon Ohio Fire and Rescue and the Lucas County EMA. The Oregon Ohio Fire and Rescue is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release. The Toledo Station maintains a vegetation control plan to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the butane vessels.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan.\n\n\n\nBuckeye continually evaluates the process for opportunities to improve safety. Also, Buckeye is implementing a corporate-wide policy to include the local first responders in regular exercises and in all 3 year PSM/RMP training cycles.\n\n"
