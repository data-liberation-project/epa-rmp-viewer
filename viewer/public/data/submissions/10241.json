      "SummaryText": "1.  The management and employees of Fruit Belt Service Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility isprepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimzie the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distribute propane.  Propane is used by our customers as a fuel.  Propane is received by truck (transports) and stored in a 26,000 gallon storage tank.  Prpane is distributed to customers by delivery trucks (bobtails).  We also fill Department of Transportaion (DOT) containers for use by customers.  This facility has equipemtn for unloading transports and equipment to loan bobtails and DOT containers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized managemtn personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 98,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario would be the failure of the largest storage tank which, when filled to the maximum amount allowed would release of 98.000 pounds of propane.  Company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of this tank to 88% at 60 F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as vapor, which finds an ignition source.  10% of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.  The distanct to the endpoint of 1 psi for the worst-case scenario is .37 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The resulting unconfined vapor travels to the lower flammability limit.  The distance to the endpoint for the lower flammability limit for the alternative scenario is .06 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  This distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release "

All of our drivers have been thoroughly trained using the NPGA's Certified Employee Training Program (CEPT).\n\n5.  There have been no accidental releases of propane in the past five years that:\n     - have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The facility has:\n     - a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     - provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n     - a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluation are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.
