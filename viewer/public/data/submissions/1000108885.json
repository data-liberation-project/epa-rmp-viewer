Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high awareness level when working with hazardous materials. \nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY The GAF Isocyanurate Foam facility in Peru, Ill is a new facility that is currently being built. Therefore, no incidents have happened to date. \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN On-site emergency response teams trained to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release. Drills are conducted periodically for on-site response teams. Local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire, sheriff, rescue, etc.) are invited to tour the facility and understand the manufacturing process along with locations of chemical storage. SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS As we continue to improve the process, safety improvements will be handled through the MOC process and implemented with employee training."

      "SummaryText": "PROCESS DESCRIPTION - GAF Isocyanurate Foam Process Raw chemical materials (MDI, polyol, catalysts, surfactant, fire retardant, minor ingredients, and hydrocarbon blowing agent) are transported to the facility by rail car and/or truck. The chemicals are transferred from the rail cars/trucks to individual storage tanks except for some minor ingredients, which are stored in drums or totes. The Pentane tank is 35500 gallons and the site may have up to 3 pentane railcars on site. \nAll of the ingredients, except for MDI, are blended in-line according to the foam formulation and mixed using a dynamic mixer. That polyol based mixture and the MDI are pumped separately to 3 pairs of high pressure pumps. In some cases, a pre-blend of the polyol and some of the ingredients might be made and used in place of straight polyol. The high pressure pumps boost the pressures of the polyol mixture and the MDI streams and supply 3 mix heads. Within the mix heads, the polyol mixture and MDI streams are brought together at high pressure and intimately mixed. That mixture immediately begins to foam. The foam is poured from the mix heads onto a conveyor line  that moves the foam through each step of processing. The liquid foam is poured  facer material in evenly spaced intervals and the foam and facer travel to the laminator to be heated. At the laminator entrance, a top facer is brought down onto the foam. In the laminator, the foam rapidly expands to the predesignated thickness and solidifies. Next the foam moves down the line to be trimmed and cut to pre-measured lengths. Once the foam is cut, it is stacked, wrapped, and cured in a warehouse. It is later shipped to customers. \nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM GAF has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely. The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies, and material requirements to minimize the possibility of releases. These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety"
