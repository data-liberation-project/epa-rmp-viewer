It is our goal to achieve and sustain \" Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training. If an emergency were to occur, it is our procedure to notify the Rumford Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nRumford power is a combined cycle power plant. The regulated substances handled on location are Anhydrous Ammonia, which is used in the Chiller System as a coolant to enhance gas turbine performance and efficiency. The second regulated substance is Aqueous Ammonia, which is used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction system to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the power plant.\n\n    As stipulated in EPA guideles, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the regulated substances at Rumford power and the results are on file at the facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps at Rumford power are to comply with EPA's Accidental Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Each process and the process equipment at Rumford power was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the afformentioned codes, laws, and regulations.\n\nRumford power has had no accidents associated with ammonia use.\n\nThe emergency response program at Rumford power is to contact the Rumford Fire Department. It is our policy to request the fire department's response to an emergency and to inspect our facility yearly to ensure they are familiar with our systems and materials.\n\nCurrently there are no plans to revise or add to the existing safety programs being administered at Rumford power.\n\nCurrent Owner:  James A. Goodman, as Receiver for Certain Assets of PMCC Calpine New England Investments, LLC.\n\nAddressee of Current Owner:\n\nKe"
