(Pool-Chem) provides chlorination for recreational swimming pools in the Phoenix, Arizona area.  Pool-Chem has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1977.\n\nPool-Chem's safety manager is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The safety manager administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1977.  The process is located at 3646 South 36th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85040.  The chlorine transfer process for Pool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. consists of chlorine one-ton containers which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from the one ton container through a filling manifold to a 20 pound cylinder. These cylinders are used off-site for the treatment of residential swimming pools. \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine on site is four one ton containers or 8,000 pounds.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.\n\nIn addition, the chlorine repackaging process is only operational for a minimal amount of time per day, five days per week.

      "SummaryText": "fer process is not in operation, all chlorine tank valves are closed.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (June 2004), the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there has been no reportable release of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Pool-Chem D.L.S. Enterprises, Inc. has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  In the event of a chlorine release at the facility, the fill operator has been instructed to secure equipment by closing all valves.  Then, the operator will evacuate area by sounding the emergency horn.  There are two switches that will activate the alarm:  at the chlorine fill station and inside the warehouse.  This horn can be heard throughout the facility.\n\nThere is an emergency contact list that includes 9-1-1 and the Phoenix Fire Department Hazardous Materials division.  In addition, there is a neighbor-call list.  The facility has worked with the Fire Department and has available for their use a B-Kit for the one-ton chlorine containers and a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPool-Chem has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (June 2004).  Recommendations from the PHA revalidation are expected to be completed by September 2004.  \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
