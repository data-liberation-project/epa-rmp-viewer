      "SummaryText": "The LaPalma Power Station has been producing electricity for over 55 years.  During this time, there has not been any chlorine release that adversely impacted the plant or the surrounding community.\n\nThe release scenarios, a worst case scenario and an alernative release scenario are designed to be exercises which calculate the potential impact on the community, based upon extreme conditions, defined by the EPA.  A worst case scenario is defined as the complete release of the largest inventory of the chemical over 10 minutes under weather conditions that would allow the chemical to travel as far as possible.  The distance(s) used in this plan are from EPA's RMP*Comp software.  It also assumes that none of the site's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational for this theoretical exercise.  However, the laws of physical science do not allow a complete release of the chemical as described in the worst case scenario.\n\nGiven these unrealistic guidelines of a worst case scenario, more realistic scenarios or alternative release scenarios were also developed.  These scenarios involve smaller releases and allow a site's safety systems to work.  The alternative release scenarios may be used by local government and industry to prepare emergency response plans.\n\nLaPalma Power Station chlorinating systems are designed and were installed with safety controls designed to prevent accidental releases.  Some of the typical safety equipment and systems use at the plant include:\n-Storage cylinders meeting American Society of Mechanical Engineering requirements.\n-Interlocks and relief valves\n-Specifically designed pressure gauges, fittings, connections, tubing and piping.\n\nPlant employees, including plant operators, electricians, mechanics, and laboratory technicians, receive training in the operation and maintenance of the chlorination system.  This training includes emphasis on:\n-Specific safe work practices\n-Routine operating procedures\n-Audit and inspectioin procedures\n-E"

This procedure requires:\n-Periodic inspection and testing of all mechanical systems\n-Detailed documentation of all inspection and maintenance activity\n-Documentation of equipment deficiencies\n-Timely and appropriate repair of all deficiencies.\n\nA Process Safety Management (PSM) system has been specifically developed for the chlorination system at this plant in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) PSM rule.  This management system includes:\n-An initial and periodic analysis of engineering and administrative controls\n-Investigation procedures designed to resolve and correct potential incidents\n-Formal audits performed by trained individuals with knowledge of chlorination systems.\n\nAll Plant personnel handling chlorine are specifically trained.  This training includes:\n-Emergency shutdown\n-Emergency operataion of the chlorinator\n-Hazards of chlorine\n-Safety procedures to be followed during normal operations\n-Emergency Response Procedures\n-Notification procedures\n-Evacuation procedures\nPeriodic inspection of the equipment is mandatory.
