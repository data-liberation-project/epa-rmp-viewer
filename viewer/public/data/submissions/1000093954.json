The 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at this facility is butane.  In addition to the pump station, Magellan stores butane onsite for blending into gasoline which requires compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations as greater than 10,000 lbs are stored onsite.  \n\nThe equipment which handles butane includes four pressure vessels, an injection pump and associated piping.  The butane pressure vessel and associated piping may contain as much as 1,570,254 lbs of butane.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nThe Allen Station has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations and maintenance procedures.  Over the past five years, there have been no reports of a harmful butane release at this station.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Pontotoc LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\n\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facility is compliant with the fourteen (14) elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures.  The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility or if they were recommended from the latest PHA and installed prior to the RMP submittal.  There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA.  The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\".  The facility complies with the Federal and State requiremen"

Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no accidental release from the butane process at the Allen Station that has required reporting under the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is a non-responding facility.  It does, however, maintain a written Emergency Response Plan.  Within the past five years the butane process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule.  In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no planned changes to the butane system.  However, Magellan strongly believes in continual improvement and will make improvements as warranted.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
