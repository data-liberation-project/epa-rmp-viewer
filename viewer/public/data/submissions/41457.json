In service to the community, the City has a history of adhering to proactive approaches for the prevention and emergency response of accidental releases of toxic substances.  Current prevention and emergency response policies adhere to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Prevention Program and Emergency Response requirements as set forth under the 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\nThe Facility is located in the City of Port St. Lucie, Florida and utilizes chlorine gas in the wastewater treatment process.  The Facility maintains a semi-enclosed (two side walls and roof, open at both ends), chlorination area and chlorination distribution system on-site.  For modeling purposes, the chlorine facility is assummed to be not enclosed due to the aforementioned construction.  Chlorine is delivered to the central area and stored on-site in cylinders containing 2,000 pounds of liquified chlorine under pressure when full.  The chlorine facility holds a maximum of seven (7) 2,000 pound cylinders.\n\nThe Facility has an outstanding performance history in conjunction with the handling, storing, maintaining and operating of chlorine gas.  No accidental releases have occurred since the system went into service in 1980.  The wastewater treatment plant is manned 16 hours/day, seven (7) days/week, 365 days/year.  State certified operational personnel are trained in the safe handling, maintenance and operation of chlorine systems that comply with EPA 40 CFR 68 regulations.  The chlorination system is designed utilizing latest technologies nd industry specific design codes and standards.  The current emergency response plans are documented and coordinated with the community emergency response officials through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Operational staf"

As per EPA regulations, the population is estimated within the circles defined by the radius' corresponding to the toxic endpoints.  These population values are          for the worst case and 621 for the alternative release.  It is noted that if an actual release did occur according to the alternative release scenario, the population at risk would be substantially less due to the plume of gas being more in the form of an elliptical pattern moving down wind of the point source rather than a circle centered on the point source.\n\nThe use of chlorination for wastewater treatment has yielded enormous benefits in the City related to preventing the spread of water borne diseases.  The City, like other modern treatment facilities, understands the value and risks of this treatment procedue.  The City has an exceptional track record of no accidental releases in its history and remains vigilant in its attention to safety regarding chlorine.  The City supports this regulatory effort to inform the public in the general vicinity of any utility of the risks associated with accidental gaseous releases.   We support efforts to notify the public of such risks at all points o"
