The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Plant in Perryville are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Perryville Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 140,196 pounds in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.  Product will be received by tanker trucks which typically hold 50,000 pounds.  The facility has forty-five 1,000 gallon \nnurse tanks which when filled would hold approximately 195,075 pounds. There are seven 560 gallon applicator tanks which would hold approximately 16,993 pounds.  Also, there are three 400 gallon applicator tanks which hold approximately 5,202 pounds.  Therefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 357,466 pounds. \n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., The Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work to meet new codes as time and budgets allow.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage a"
