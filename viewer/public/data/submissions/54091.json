Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. This electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Hondo Facility located at 240 Highway 173 North, Hondo, TX 78861.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Hondo Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Hondo Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nHelena is submitting this electronic RMP as its 5-year update.  As required for the 5-year update, the Hondo Facility has (1) reviewed its Registration Information, (2) verified the latitude and longitude coordinates, (3) confirmed the appropriate NAICS, (4) reviewed and updated its worst-case and alternative-case off-site consequence analysis scenarios, (5) revised the affected population estimates using the Landview? version 6 software, (6) updated its 5-year accident history, (7) reviewed its contingency plan to satisfy the emergency response requirements, (8) reviewed its Prevention Program as related to its training, compliance audits, maintenance procedures, and operating procedures.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe Hondo Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is unloaded from a railcar and batch processed through a reactor.  The process operations conducted at this facility are performed by an i"

      "SummaryText": "ndependent contractor.  The independent contractor performs the batch reactor operations using a mobile pipe reactor.  The batch operations consist of unloading the anhydrous ammonia from the rail car into the reactor and mixing it with water and phosphoric acid to produce ammonium phosphate fertilizer.  The contractor is responsible to OSHA for Process Safety Management compliance. Helena Chemical Company does not own or operate the formulation processes at the facility.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst case and alternative consequence analysis were completed for the ammonia storage process. The worst-case scenario release for the Hondo Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank (a railcar) were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side.  The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment operated by the independent contractor, and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur because excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the severed transfer line.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Ferltilizer Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Helena facility.  The Fertilizer Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The fertilizer handling process is implemented by an independent contractor.  \n\nTo ensure that its contractor is responsible to Helena for complying w"

Have in place and certify compliance with an OSHA Process Safety Management Plan (PSM);\n?    Make available to Helena and EPA upon request, any documentation necessary to comply with the PSM;\n?    Review, certify and comply with Helena?s emergency shutdown procedures for ammonia unloading, and emergency notification and evacuation procedures.\n\nAll of Helena?s contractors subject to this standard will be required to acknowledge and sign an Independent Contractor Certification Statement.  Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and Operating Procedures to its contractors for review and implementation.  A copy of the Helena RMP will be available for the independent contractor?s review at the Helena facility.  Likewise, the independent contractor shall provide its OSHA PSM, operating, maintenance, and emergency response procedures as required by Helena or other local, state or federal auditing agency.  Helena personnel are responsible for providing notification to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department when its contractor intends to operate the reactor.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nHelena Chemical Company?s Hondo Facility is a non-responding facility.  Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Hondo Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Hondo Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).
