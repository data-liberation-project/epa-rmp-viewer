This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems to address releases of ammonia.  Designated facility personnel have received required OSHA training to respond to an ammonia release.  If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. a reportable quantity release), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they provide additional response resources as needed.\n\n\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThis facility is a poultry processing facility used to slaughter, cut-up, package, refrigerate and ship fresh poultry.  The facility receives live chickens which are slaughtered, processed and refrigerated for shipping to destinations in the region.  We use ammonia as a refrigerant in five (5) separate systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers, spiral freezers, evaporator units, water chillers and ice makers.  The systems are identified as systems 1 through 5 and have a maximum intended inventories of 16,146, 5,320, 10,649, 11,991 and 20,409 pounds, respectively.  Thus, the total plant capacity is 64,517 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS  \n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in ammonia refrigeration system No. 5 when it is operating with its normal inventory of 6,452 pounds, resulting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minutes.  The resulting distance to a 200 ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 1"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends off-site to a distance of 0.1 miles. \n\n\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia regrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe have not had any accidents involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the five years prior to April 13, 2020.   \n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to employ designated facility personnel to respond to the emergency.  Designated response personnel and procedures are identified in the written plans entitled Mountaire Farms Emergency Release Notification/Procedures and Process Safety Management, Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  These personnel have received necessary response operations training in accordance with applicable OSHA regulations.  Designated personnel will also perform required external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee).\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY  \n\n\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems."
