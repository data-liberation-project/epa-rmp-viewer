      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the KMG Gathering LLC (KMG) Hambert Compressor Station (Station.)  The station is not subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  However, KMG has decided proactively to apply the standard to the station to provide a higher standard of safety.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nKMG has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention.  KMG has an extensive operator and maintenance training program.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  KMG?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, KMG personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, KMG will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nKMG's Hambert Compressor Station (Station) is located in Weld County near the intersection of WCR 38 and WCR 35 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  The Station consists of two compressor units, #s 51 and 52, that discharge 18 MMCF/D to delivery points via a 20\" cleanable pipeline.  The discharge pressure is not to exceed 1,220 psig.  \n\nThe compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and compresses it for delivery to other stations.   The station is equipped with inlet separation.  Liquids recovered are pumped into the station discharge.\n\nThe Station?s maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances.  Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Hambert Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Company in the early 1970's.  HS Resources purchased th"

KMG acquired HS Resources in August, 2001.\n\nProgram Level\n\nKMG has determined that Program Level 1 applies to the Station for the following reasons:\n\n1.    The Station has a documented Emergency Response Plan which has been coordinated with the local Fire Department;\n2.    The Station has had no accidental releases of the regulated substances (condensate) that directly or indirectly caused a death, injury, or response or restoration activity for an environmental receptor in the previous five years; and\n3.    The distance to any \"receptor\" is greater than the distance to the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario of 0.3 miles.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\nAccident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents that meet the criterion for inclusion in this submittal.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through KMG?s ?Near-miss? program."
