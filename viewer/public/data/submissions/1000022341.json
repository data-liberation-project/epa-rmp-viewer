Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAs stated in the Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Policy and Principles, Hexion Specialty Chemicals, Inc. is committed to health, safety and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risk, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Hexion Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operation or buisiness objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state thate safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nThis plant makes formaldehyde solutions, phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes a formaldehyde manufacturing facility and three resin reactors.  Although we sell some formaldehyde, it is primarily used on site as a raw material for both types of resins.  Aqua ammonia is used in small amounts as a raw material for urea-formaldehyde resins.\n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde                   1,500,000 lbs\nAmmonia                          26,500 lbs\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety mangement program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.

The Senior Plant Engineer has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nDesignated personnel are assigned to maintain and inmprove the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping opeation procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nDesignated personnel maintain an Operation Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operation Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.  Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track the items to completion.\n\nA Management of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review.  This review may include process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by technical and plant personnel.  \n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.

The schedule is based on plant experience to redue the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measrues for welkding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to breif them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs thhat impact process safety.\n\nIncidents that cause or could have casued a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence.  These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and federal regulations.  Regional Safety and Environmental professionals periodically review the health, safety and environmental programs.  Addressing recommendations from these audits keeps the Facility's Safety and Environmental programs effective.\n\n4.
