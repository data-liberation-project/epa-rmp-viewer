Medical emergencies will require notification of the Carolinas Medical Center and associated ambulance service via 911.  The Facility currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire and hazardous material emergency response team to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.  The Motiva Enterprises, LLC - Charlotte (North) Terminal transfers/stores refined product (regular/premium gasoline and diesel fuel) and handles product additives, including the liquified butane blending system (direct injection into refined product pipelines to the truck loading rack).  The Risk Management Program covers the butane blending system including the associated piping, 1 x 60,000 gallon vessel, the blending skid, sampling unit (Bartec-Benke), and the truck offloading station product connection point.    The Facility's worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of the blending system's 60,000 gallon liquified (pressure) butane vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (fill shutoff device at 85% with an alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This is the recommended scenario based on the EPA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  The facility's alternate scenario ([unlikely] resulting in a substantive release based on discussion with Texon/MCE and terminal personnel) is a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) resulting in an explosion and associated fireball.  Other alternatives considered included pump failure, liquid butane pipe failure and tr"

These scenarios were either considered highly unlikely or resulted in less of an impact.\n  \nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Charlotte (North) Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68) and the U.S. Department of Labor - Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Regulations (29CFR Part 1910.119).  The butane blending system is designed, constructed, and maintained to meet or exceed the NFPA #58 requirements for Liquified Petroleum Gas Storage.  To this date, this Facility has never had an accident involving the butane blending system (new process) resulting in dealths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the Charlotte (North) Terminal butane blending system, it is the policy of the Facility to initially contact the Charlotte Fire Department and request their assistance.  The Facility maintains a trained (annually) incipient fire and hazardous substance emergency response team, as referenced above.  The Facility's emergency response plans are coordinated with the Charlotte Fire Department and the Mecklenburg County LEPC.  The Charlotte Fire Department, which maintains a full hazardous material response team (HazMat II), is aware of the Facility's butane blending system, access via Tom Sadler Road, and available fire suppression equipment including approximately fifteen 20lb. ABC fire extinguishers, and water sources (two hydrants available adjacent to the Terminal with a total flow of approximately 2,210 gpm).  Motiva Enterprises, LLC Charlotte (North) Terminal maintains a vegetation control program to minimize plant growth within 10 feet of the system."
