THIS COMPANY IS A FULL SERVICE FARM SUPPLY COMPANY WITH THE GREASTEST RISK OF RELEASE COMING FROM OUR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE TANK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIROMENT. THIS LOCATION HAS 1 BULK TANK AND 17 NURSE TANKS. THIS FACILITY HAS THE CAPACITY TO STORE 209,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE STORAGE TANK IS LOCATED ON THE EAST EDGE OF THE TOWN OF CAINSVILLE. THE TANK IS WEST OF THE OFFICE AND IS THE NORTH STORAGE TANK AND THE VALVE IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH END OF THE TANK. THE NURSE TANK FILL STATION IS LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE STORAGE TANK. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE IN THE AMOUNT OF 131,000 POUNDS. THE RELEASE WOULD BE 13,100 POUNDS PER MINUTE FOR TEN MINUTES. ASSUMING A 1.5 M/SEC. WIND SPEED, THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE 3.3 MILES AFFECTING 225 PEOPLE. THE ALTERNATE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE. THE QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 2800 POUNDS AT A RATE OF 280 POUNDS PER MINUTE. THE RELEASE DURATION WOULD BE 10 MINUTES. ASSUMING A 3M/SEC WIND SPEED THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT WOULD BE .10 MILE AFFECTING 5 PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM IN EFFECT. THE FACILITY HAS BEEN REVEIWED FOR GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLSHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. (ANSI), AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.

WE INSPECT OUR PLANT ON A REGULAR BASIS  AND WE REVIEW OUR SAFETY POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38. WE ALSO PROVIDE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT TO KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA). WE WILL NOTIFY THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS LEPC IF A RELEASE OCCURS. THE NUMBERS TO CALL ARE 911 AND (660)425-6424 RESPECTIVELY. OUR ROLE AS THE COMPANY WILL BE TO SECORE THE AREA UNTIL LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARRIVE AND ASSIST THEM IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THIS IS OUR PLAN IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR."
