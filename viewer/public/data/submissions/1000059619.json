These standards outline requirements for occupancy classification, GCTF system classification, natural gas (methane) classification, requirements for natural gas (methane) use, design and construction of equipment systems, pressure limiting devices, pressure relief protection, installation requirements, and field pressure tests. Monitoring systems in the facility are comprised of pressure, temperature and level indicators, inspections, as well as other system safeguards. Level indicators are located on the Cooling Tower.  Pressure indicators are located on process equipment and throughout the system. The level and pressure indicators allow operators to monitor system operations and to determine potential adverse situations in the event of deviations from standard or acceptable operating conditions. In addition, the natural gas (methane) system at the facility is controlled and monitored using the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tinspections;\r\n\u00bf\tpreventive maintenance;\r\n\u00bf\tpersonnel training; and\r\n\u00bf\tincident investigations.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe GCTF process commenced operations as a regulated process on November 15, 2011.  Solar Turbines, Inc. has been using methane in the Fuel Consumption Process which was exempted from the EPA RMP and CalARP Program regulations on January 23, 2000.  An investigation into the facility's accident history associated with the existing (but previously exempt) supply side process revealed that there had been no reportable releases of methane over the past five years (August 2011 to August 2016)."

Once the GCTF is prepared for operation, the procedure will be to open and valve off the main 650 psig feed line to the GCTF process piping.  \r\n\r\nThe GCTF consists of an existing SOLAR gas turbine driving a SOLAR gas compressor and all necessary equipment to conduct a closed loop test. The GCTF will operate with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or odorized natural gas (methane) to test solar gas compressors. The original GCTF loop estimated volume is 2,300 cubic feet. In 2016 construction of a second loop was completed that has an estimated volume of 1,500 cubic feet. Only one loop will be run at a time. The weight of natural gas in the process is not expected to exceed 13,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nThe GCTF system has a series of valves some automated and some manual. The manual valves are not used during testing. Once the GCTF is pressurized, the inlet valve will be closed.
