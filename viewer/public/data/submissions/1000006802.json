              "Description": "BG Chlor-Alkali Process - This prevention program is applied to the Cell Room, Liquefaction Area, SCR Ammonia system, and Marshalling Yard areas.  All prevention program elements are applied similarly to each area.  The Marshalling Yard is not a process unit but is a temporary storage area for railcars.  Consequently, PHA information is different for this area.  Among the PHA differences in Section 7.4 are:  A) Dates of the last PHAs for the Cell Room, Liquefaction, and SCR Ammonia system are 10/2006, 3/2007, and 7/2004, respectively.  B)   The PHA technique for this area is What If and Checklist, whereas the other PHAs additionally utilize HAZOP.  C) Expected or actual dates of completion of all changes from the Cell Room, Liquefaction, and Ammonia System PHA are 10/31/2007, 12/31/2010, and 6/30/2005.  D) Major hazards are the same for each area except that the Marshalling Yard does not have runaway reaction, overpressurization, overfilling, contamination, or loss of utility hazards.  E) The Marshalling Yard doesn't have process controls such as relief valves as they do not apply, whereas these are used in the other areas.  F) The other areas utilize mitigation systems, including dikes and neutralization systems.  The Ammonia system utilizes a deluge system.  G) Monitoring/detection systems include process area detectors that are in use for each area.  H) Changes made since the last PHAs include process parameters and process controls for all areas except the Ammonia System and Marshalling Yard.",

All prevention program elements are applied similarly to each of these units, except that there are differences in PHA information.  The differences in Section 7.4 between PHAs are:  A) Dates of last PHAs are as follows:  VCM Tank Farm - 2/2005, Cracking - 8/2005, VCM Purification - 11/2005, Catoxid - 11/2008, Oxychlorination - 10/2004, Chlorine Unloading - 10/2005, EDC Manufacturing - 3/2006, EDC Purification - 5/2006, EDC Tank Farm - 12/2006, VCM Pipelines - 4/2005, and Ammonia System - 1/2007.  B) Techniques used all include HAZOP and Checklist.  C) Expected or actual completion of all changes from last PHA are: VCM Tank Farm - 7/31/2008, Cracking - 12/31/2010, VCM Purification - 12/31/2005, Catoxid - 12/31/2010, Oxychlorination - 11/9/2006, Chlorine Unloading - 4/30/2008, EDC Manufacturing - 1/31/2009, EDC Purification - 10/31/2007, EDC Tank Farm - 10/29/2007, VCM Pipelines - 11/21/2008, and Ammonia System - 4/30/2009. D) Major hazards are the same for each unit. E) Process controls in use are same for all units except for the ammonia system which does not use a scrubber, backup pump, and quench system. F) Mitigation systems are same for all units.  G) Monitoring/ detection systems are same for all units.  H) Changes since last PHA include changes process parameters and installation of process controls for all units.",

Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (A? 68.155(a))\n\nOxyChem has established a system for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (A? 68.155(b))\n\nThe BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility consists of two chemical production plants that are both owned by OxyChem:  Battleground Chlor-Alkali Plant and La Porte VCM Plant.  These two plants are located on contiguous property and the operations are within the same industrial group.  Therefore, these two chemical plants are considered one stationary source.  Two processes have been defined for this stationary source: BG Chlor-Alkali Process and LP VCM Process.\n\nThe facility handles seven substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  These substances are- \nAmmonia (anhydrous)\nChlorine\nChloroform\nEthyl Chloride\nHydrogen Chloride (anhydrous)\nPropylene\nVinyl Chloride\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (A? 68.155(c))\n\nThe prevention program for the BG Chlor-Alkali Process and LP VCM Process has been pr"

The program consists of the following elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Key Procedures,    Contractors\n\nEach of the items listed above are documented and maintained in manuals at the facility.  These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History (A? 68.155(d))\n\nThere were two accidents within the LP VCM Process during the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (A? 68.155(e))\n\nThe BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (A?ERTA?) trained in these emergency response procedures.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (A?EOCA?).  In addition, the BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (A?SSPA?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the La Porte Area Local Emergency Planning Committee (A?LEPCA?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (A? 68.155(f))\n\nThe BG Chlor-Alkali-VCM facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of the plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental"
