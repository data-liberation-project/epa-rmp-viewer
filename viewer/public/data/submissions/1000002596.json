The combination of the Company's herbicides, seeds and related genetic trait products provides growers with integrated solutions to more efficiently and cost-effectively produces crops at higher yields, while controlling weeds, insects and diseases. We are committed to pursuing these goals in sustainable ways that meet people's needs without compromising future generation's ability to meet their needs.\n\nOne of the locations contributing to this vision is Monsanto's Luling manufacturing plant, located at 12501 River Road in Luling, Louisiana. This facility manufactures Roundup brand herbicide and ACL brand active chlorine. As part of operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of chlorine, formaldehyde, phosphorus trichloride and isopropylamine to require compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.\n\nThe major elements of the RMP prevention program are very similar to OSHA's PSM regulation.
