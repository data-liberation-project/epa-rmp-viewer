The most recent update of the hazard review for the anhydrous ammonia process was conducted on February 27, 2020. Results indicate that no high-risk hazards were identified through the hazard review updates.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  Written standard operating procedures have been developed for the covered processes and are reviewed and revised as needed. The operating procedures were last revised on September 16, 2020. Operating procedures for the Anhydrous Ammonia Process are certified annually, with the last annual certification on Operating procedures for the Anhydrous Ammonia Process are certified annually, with the last annual certification on September 16, 2020. \n\n\n\nTRAINING:  The Walnut Grove Retail Facility staff, as well as Grow West corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of regulated substances can be reduced by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program. The training program was last reviewed on October 01, 2018. \n\n\n\nThe current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n  1.  Initial employee training;\n\n  2.

The Facility RMP Management of Change (MOC) procedures are used to evaluate all changes to process materials, controls, equipment, and procedures. The MOC procedures were last modified on September 14, 2020.\n\n\n\nPRE START-UP SAFETY REVIEW:  The pre start-up safety review (PSSR) applies to additions or modifications to the Anhydrous Ammonia Process that require the safety information to be revised or updated. Whenever changes in affected processes are identified or planned, they must be evaluated as to the need for a pre start-up safety review. This assessment is undertaken in conjunction with the MOC review. Additionally, a pre start-up safety review is performed in conjunction with the MOC review when the proposed change requires modifications to the safety procedures. The most recent change that required a PSSR occurred in 2015, and the PSSR was completed on August 5, 2015.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:  Periodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Records of the audits and follow-up documentation are maintained to indicate findings and resolution of findings. The most recent compliance audit was conducted on April 25, 2019.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:  Although no incidents involving regulated substances have occurred at the Facility in the last five years, an incident investigation program is in place.
