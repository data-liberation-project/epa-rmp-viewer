      "SummaryText": "Unilever Newville Regional Distribution Center\r\n\r\nA risk management plan has been implemented at the Newville facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The facility is located at 954 Centerville Road, Newville, PA 17241, in Cumberland County.  The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse for consumer products, such as deoderants, packaged in aerosol cans for retail sale.  The products are manufactured at a separate location by Unilever Co.  The operator of the facility is DHL Supply Chain, a subsidiary of Deutshe Post Ag, Bonn, Germany.\r\n\r\nThe propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials.  Specifically, the components consist primarily of propane and isobutane.   The maximum projected quantities of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's ecomp program, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond the warehouse property.  No offsite receptors are impacted.  Since this is a new building for the operation, no prior accidents have happened at the facility.  There were also no accidents at the previous facility that resulted in any offsite environmental impacts.  \r\n\r\nThe site has a comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety program including corporate policies and procedures, site specific work instructions, formal employee training, annual emergency drills, regular inspections, emergency supplies and internal assessments.  Emergency response activities at the facility are coordinated with the Cumberland County LEPC and Newville Volunteer Fire Department."
