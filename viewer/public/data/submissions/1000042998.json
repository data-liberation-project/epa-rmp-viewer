Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Solvay USA, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment\n\nis demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as\n\ndesign, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\n\nprocesses at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\n\nregulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur Winder, Georgia facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.\n\nThese products are used in the manufacture a variety of consumer goods, including personal care products\n\nsuch as soaps, shampoos, detergents, and textile processing aids. We also make polyester based polymers\n\nwhich are used for soil release in detergent applications and in textile processing.. We presently have 3\n\nsubstances at our facility, which are regulated under the EPA RMP regulations. These are Epichlorohydrin\n\n[Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methylamine [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-].\n\n\n\nEpichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for production of Episulfonate Solution - an intermediate\n\nused to produce surfactants for Industrial and Personal Care Products. Methylamine [Methanamine] is used\n\nfor Methyl Taurine - a surfactant for commercial cleaning applications. Dimethylamine [Methanamine, Nmethyl-]\n\nis used for production of ASC Intermediate, which is used to produce an end product used in various\n\nIndustrial and Personal Care Products.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 200,000 lb.\n\nMethylamine [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine [Methanamine, N-methyl-] are present on-site at our\n\nfacility in maxi"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes What If,\n\nHAZOP, and Layers of Protection Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with\n\nexpertise in engineering and process operations plus experienced operations personnel. The safety studies\n\nare revalidated at least every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\n\nmanner. The most recent PHA update for Methyl Taurine and use of MonoMethylAmine was performed on\n\n6/17/2011. The most recent PHA update for ASC Intermediate and the use of Dimethylamine was performed\n\non 8/29/2012. The most recent PHA update for Episulfonate Solution and use of Epichlorohydrin, was held\n\non 08/14/2012.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nWe maintain written Equipment Operating Procedures addressing safety and quality specific to the operating\n\nequipment and system.
