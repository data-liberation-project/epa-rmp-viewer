ITW has recognized the obligation for our operations worldwide to be in compliance with the environmental laws, regulations and the legitimate interests of the communities in which we live.  The need to preserve and protect vital natural resources including our air, water and land is essential for the future.  Each operating facility is responsible for communication and implementation of and adherence to, this policy.\nITW companies must have a comprehensive and consitent environmental focus in all of their activities.  Each company shall strive to maintain compliance with environmental regulations, continously improve environmental performance, and minimize environmental impacts through pollution prevention activities.  Having a safe and clean workplace and maintaining compliance with environmental regulations is a basic first step in following this policy.  ITW will systematically evaluate the environmental performance of its companies.  We encourage everyone to participate in this endeavor to improve our workplace environment so we may be proud of our place in the community.\n\nITW's Safety Policy:\nAt ITW, we believe one of the best ways for the company to show its people their value is to provide a safe environment in which to work.  ITW's primary motivation in promoting saftey is that we do not want our people to suffer injury or illness.\nITW is guided by the following safety principles: First, we will continue to manage safety on the same priority with production and quality.  Second, we believe all ITW people have an equal voice in identifying and correcting hazards.  Third, we are committed to continued involvement by our people in taking responsibility for safety performance, without relinquishing management committment.\nSafety must be an integral part of all operations, such that the elimination of accidents will become not just an objective, but "

      "SummaryText": "a way of life.\n\nFacility Description:\nITW TACC operates an adhesive manufacturing facility located in Rockland, Massachusetts.  The facility building houses manufacturing, office and warehouse space.  Other structures on the side include 13 above ground solvent storage tanks, 3 above ground propellant tanks, all associated piping, a gas house and reactor room for the pressurized container filling. The processes which trigger applicability to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) are the 3 above ground flammable propellant storage tanks associated with the pressurized container filling operation.  The vicinity of the area is light comercial and industrial area.\nITW TACC previously maintained this operation at their Cartersville, Georgia facility.  The Cartersville facility was closed on 10/24/2003 and all operations relocated to our Rockland, Massachusetts faility.  An RMP for the Cartersville facility was submitted on 6/17/99 for the propellant operation.  The Rockland facility did not trigger applicability of EPA's RM Program until the Georgia operation was relocated to Massachusetts.\n\nRegulated Substances:\nBased on a comprehensive review, ITW TACC has identified the following substances regulated by the US EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP):  1) Flammable Mixture (propane/isobutane), 2) Dimethyl Ether (DME), and 3) Isopentane.  The maximum quantities available on site are 35,190 lbs flammable mixture, 43,010 lbs dimethyl ether and 26,520 lbs isopentane.  Each of these substances are above the threshold quantity (TQ) for RMP applicability.  The provisions of the RMP therefore apply to the processes using these regulated substances.  The flammable mixture (isobutane/propane blend), DME and isopentane are used in manufacturing pressurized spray adhesives and are stored in aboveground, horizontal tanks with capacities of 9,200 gallons, 9,200 gallons and 6,000 gallons, respectively.  Controls on the tanks allow for maximum filling to 85% of capacity.\n\nWorst Case Release Scen"

      "SummaryText": "ario:\nThe worst case release scenario (WCS) was based on the catastrophic rupture of either of the largest vessels in each process, the DME propellant storage tank and the Flammable Mixture propellant storage tank  As per the RMP, the entire quantity of each substance was considered released.  An administrative control in place for each of the propellant tanks limits the maximum fill to 85% of the tank capacity.  RMP default data was selected and the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used for determining the impact distance.  The two scenarios were shown to have off-site impacts.\nBoth scenarios are extremely unlikely to actually occur.  The tanks are designed to withstand a maximum pressure of 250 psi, but are operated at much lower pressures (5-70 psi).  Also the existing safety practices at the facility will help minimize any incidents, the tanks will be regularly inspected and tested for mechanical integrity (according to manufacturer's recommendations).  Rockland, Massachusetts is not a known area for earthquakes or tornado activity.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario:\nThe following alternative release scenarios (ARS) were evaluated for this process based on EPA guidance:\nTransfer hose releases dues to splits or sudden hose uncoupling\nVessel overfilling and spill, or overpressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks\nTACC believes these scenarios are more likely than the worst case scenario, though still highly unlikely due to the specification of the equipment and on-going safety practices.  Similar to the WCS, the maximum fill capacity of each tank (85%) was considered, as well as  the secondary containment dike for the isopentane.  Only 50% of the contents were assumed to be released during these scenarios.  RMP default  meteorological data was selected, and the EPA's RMP*COMP software was used for determining off-site impact.  For the ARSs considered, the distance to the endpoint for the various substances released in the above scenarios was between 0."

      "SummaryText": "06 mile and 0.3 miles.\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\nTACC has developed and implemented a Contingency and Emergency Response Program which addresses the processes using hazardous substances.  Safe operating procedures are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary.  All process equipment is audited monthly during the saftey audit to ensure safe operation.  Affected employees are trained regularly in handling hazardous substances, operating safe equipment and in emergency response actions.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nSince this operation is new to the Rockland facility, there have been no accidental releases from any of the covered processes in the last five years, which would trigger reporting requirements under the RMP.  \n\nEmergency Responce Action:\nThe facility has developed and implemented a detailed Contingency and Emergency Response Program which includes emergency and incident notification reporting, emergency health care, emergency response actions, training requirements, and incident prevention program.  The facility's Contingnecy Plan has been coordinated with the Rockland Fire Department, our LEPC.  Copies of the plan have been submitted to the Rockland Fire Department, Rockland Police Department, Rockland Board of Health, Rockland Town Administrator, Fire Departments of surrounding towns, local hospital and emergency care giver and MA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\n\nSafety Improvements:\nTACC believes that the processes storing and using the regulated substances are operated and maintained in a safe manner.  As the operation is new, there are no additional plans for changes specific to the affected processes.  However, improving safety is an on-going practice and is addressed monthly by the safety committee.  TACC plans to take all necessary, realistic, technically and economically feasible actions to improve safety."
