      "SummaryText": "In the preceding RMP, an evaluation of the catastrophic loss an the more probable alternatives were evaluated using the RMP software provided by EPA/  Brainerd Chemical of North Carolina LLC has two chemicals on site that has exceeded the threshold limits for RMP.  These chemicals are Formaldehyde and Hydrofluoric Acid.  It is expected that the worst case scenario for Formaldehyde would be a catastrophic event resulting in the total release of the product from the bulk storage tank, followed by its complete vaporization to form a toxic vapor cloud.  The more probable cause for release would be a ruptured line or hose during repackaging operations  that would result in the loss of the contents of the tank into the building.  It is believed that this incident would be cleaned up before all of the spill could be vaporized and leave site.  The worst case scenario for Hydrofluoric Acid id expected to be a complete release of the full amount of the tanker.  This would most likely happen as a result of line failure at the point that the tanker was almost full.  Since the building only partially contains the tanker, it is possible that the contents of the tanker would flow into the parking lot where it would be evaporated.  The more likely scenario is an incident in which a single drum is spilled.  Again, it is possible tha the contents fo the drum would flow into the parking lot where it would vaporize."
