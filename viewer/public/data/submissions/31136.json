If a spill of a reportable quantity were to occur we have a notification list of all regulatory agencies that would need to be notified both local and national.  We have designated employees who will be in charge during emergecny situations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nEmployees at Interstate Chemical Company are continually monitored to assure that they handle materials safely.  Supervisors are instructed to provide additional training should a deficiency occur.  All new employees receive training prior to working in our warehouse.  \n\nTo improve the safety of the facility we have placed hydrofluoric acid kits in the warehouse and trained all the employees on the use of that product.  While it is unlikely that we will ever have an incident occur with hydrofluoric acid, we are better prepared to provide first aid should an employee ever get burned.\n"
