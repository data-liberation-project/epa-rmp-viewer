Support for this goal is manifested in a number of ways such as:\r\n\u00bf\tA corporate Health, Safety and Environmental department staffed with trained professionals.\r\n\u00bf\tTraining programs in chemical safety, accident prevention and emergency response.\r\n\u00bf\tPrompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\r\n\u00bf\tAdherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping of materials.\r\n\u00bf\tAudits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The Hawkins Water Treatment Group - Memphis Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes a number of materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and equipping them with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community..\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident Histo"
