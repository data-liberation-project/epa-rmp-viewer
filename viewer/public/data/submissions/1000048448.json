Support for this goal is manifested in a number of ways such as:\n\n?    A corporate Health, Safety and Environmental department staffed with trained professionals.\n\n?    Training programs in chemical safety, accident prevention and emergency response.\n\n?    Prompt investigation of near misses and incidents to identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.\n\n?    Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\n\n?    Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping of materials.\n\n?    Audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The Hawkins Water Treatment Group - Memphis Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes a number of materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools and other uses.  The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility are chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage.  This starts with DOT approved cylinders that are robustly designed to contain chemicals through all conditions expected during processing as well as mishandling that could cause a cylinder to fall or shift during transport.  It continues through having employees trained in proper handling procedures, and equipping them with equipment to safely move chemicals during storage and transportation.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the Chlorine Institute, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community..\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident Histo"

Call the local fire department for hazmat assistance.\n\n2.    Evacuate to a safe distance.  \n\nThe local fire department has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site.  In order to help assist the local fire department, Hawkins has a special recovery vessel on site in which a leaking 150 pound or smaller cylinder can be inserted to contain any further release.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  While Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than continued compliance to industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Zero Can Be Done\".\n\n"
