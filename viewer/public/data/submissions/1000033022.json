      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\n\nWestern New York Energy, LLC\n\n\n\nThis RMP resubmission is being submitted to fulfill the 5-year update requirement of CAA Section 112(r).\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWestern New York Energy, LLC (WNY Energy) has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training on the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.  \n\n\n\nWNY Energy has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, Spill Prevention Controls and Countermeasures Plan, Facility Response Plan, and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans have annual training requirements (at a minimum) to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to attend orientation where the Plans listed above are reviewed. New employees also undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nWNY Energy's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nWNY Energy is located in Medina, Orleans County, New York.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substances stored at the facility are anhydrous ammonia and flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia is stored as a gas liquefied by pressure in an 18,000 gallon aboveground steel tank.  The"

      "SummaryText": " worst case scenario used is a release of the entire contents of the storage vessel, 97,200 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of RMP documentation detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia.  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are also provided as part of RMP documentation.  The ammonia tank sits on a concrete pad, passive mitigation was not included as part of this scenario.  The facility can elect to place a fence around the ammonia tank for security purposes; the typical chain link fence used to enclose the ammonia tank would not prevent migration of a release.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  The Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge is within the worst case distance to endpoint for ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2.    Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 165,000 gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine initial RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of RMP determination documentation.  The worst case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 924,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 924,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 314,160 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112(r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst case release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nAlternate Scenar"

      "SummaryText": "ios:\n\n1.    Anhydrous Ammonia:  The alternate scenario used for anhydrous ammonia is a release of 10,000 pounds due to a rupture disk/relief valve failure from the ammonia piping system.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed is 30 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0m/sec.  The facility control room is manned 24 hours/day and would be alerted of the relief valve failure at the ammonia tank within minutes.  The emergency shutdown system installed at the facility has been considered in this scenario as active mitigation.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6.  No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\n2.    Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations, therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of RMP documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated cons"

No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nThe flammable mixture is classified as a Program 2 substance.  WNY Energy has listed the flammable mixture as Program 3 in the RMP as a worst case scenario.  Anhydrous ammonia qualifies as a Program 3 substance.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\n\n\nWNY Energy's Maintenance Department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufactures recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Written weekly and monthly visual inspections are performed and the reports are on file in the Safety Manager's Office. Quarterly LDAR monitoring is performed by the Safety Manager and reports filed per State regulations.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWork-related injuries have occurred at WNY Energy since plant start-up, none of the injuries reported required OSHA or other agency notification and were not associated with the RMP covered processes. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWNY Energy has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan.  WNY Energy also has an Emergency Action Plan that details evacuation and response procedures for spills and releases, fire, etc.  The Plans listed in this section have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWNY Energy provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.  Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of needed changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"
