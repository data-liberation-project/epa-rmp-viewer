This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery, located in Anacortes, Washington, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce refined petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline, jet, diesel, and residual fuels) from various crude oils.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, pentane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Marathon Anacortes Refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing an RMP regulated flammable mixture. The full tank inventory was assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.   Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was considered in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE involving the full inventory of a butane railcar (n-butane). No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the railcar; therefore, the full tankcar inventory is assumed to rel"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive or active mitigation measures was taken in evaluating this ARS. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for communicating the potential hazards of our operations with the local community and improving emergency planning and response programs.\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery is not required under the RMP regulation to report a Toxic WCS nor Toxic ARS scenario because there are no RMP regulated toxic substances stored at our facility that exceed the RMP threshold quantity.  However, the following toxic RMP substances are present at our facility, stored below the RMP threshold quantity: hydrogen sulfide and anhydrous HCL (used for equipment acidation (cleanout) prior to catalyst addition and unit startup in Process 1 and Process 4)). Although we are not required to evaluate the effects of a toxic release under the RMP regulation, we went ahead and evaluated hypothetical scenarios to better understand the potential affects an accidental, toxic release might have on our community. This information, along with other RMP information, has been shared with our community and local responders through meetings and brochure publications.\r\n \r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nDuring the previous 5-year period there has not been a release of RMP flammable chemicals that has required people outside the refinery to shelter-in-place or evacuate. In addition, the refinery has not experienced a release of RMP toxic chemicals that has required people outside the refinery to shelter-in-place or evacuate. The likelihood of a flammable or toxic release adversely impacting people outside of the refinery is extremely low given the programs we have in place to prevent this type of accident. However, every incident or near-miss at the facility is carefully investigated to determine ways to prevent similar incid"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The OSHA PSM program is administered by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries under Washington Administrative Code 296-67. \r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, safety, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nEngagement of our hourly folks is a key factor for effective design of proposed changes. Anacortes has a practice implemented in 2019 for hourly participation during the hazard evaluations as well as during the PSSR review. In addition, we established a site process safety indicator that is tracked and reported monthly for hourly participation in MOC's.  The Operations Man"

In this role the champion supports and encourages compliance by enforcing MOC action item commitments, identifying strategic objectives, and providing resources to maintain regulatory compliance and the champion of our process safety indicator associated with hourly participation in MOC hazard reviews.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in an MAPV (Maximum Alarm and Process Variable) Database.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique and a Checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the ori"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operation, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  The procedures are also re-certified every 5 years.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Marathon Anacortes Refinery maintains the MAPV database mentioned above that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Marathon Anacortes Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nThe Marathon Anacortes Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during normal operations in addition to higher levels during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Marathon Anacortes Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of contracting companies.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nAt Anacortes, all contractors are required to attend Pacific Northwest Refinery Safety Overview training (PNW-RSO).

This material was created by the PNW-RSO Board (made up of Safety Professionals from the Washington State Refineries (P66, Shell and U.S. Oil), working with Safety Professionals from OSCA). The PNW-RSO teaches specifics of each of the 5 facilities in Washington State. The training covers commonalities and differences for each of the refining facilities. This training is specific to the refineries in the PNW. We believe this training sets us apart from others. We have taken the time to create a hazard specific training for the facilities our contractors are about to enter. We believe this helps create a better understanding of our expectations and safety culture before our contractors ever step on-site.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this site has developed a Contractor Safety Council. Contractor Safety Council meets quarterly or more frequently, as needed.   Work Group Safety Huddles are held monthly.  All participants share in the responsibility for the quality of these safety huddles.  The purpose of these huddles is to share information, provide a forum to set safety goals, promote accident prevention, to train, and to surface and resolve safety issues.  Special purpose safety huddles are also scheduled to communicate a major issue or to emphasize safety concerns prior to an event such as the start of a turnaround. There is also a stand-alone agenda item to discuss PSM related incidents and information in the Contractor Safety Council Meeting, which is captured in the meeting minutes. The expectation is that this would provide a specific opportunity to deliver PSM information and provide a forum to discuss process safety issues at this meeting that would then be disseminated at the Contractor Work Group Safety Meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Contractor Safety Council Board includes the Maintenance Manager or designee, the Capital Projects Manager or designee, and the HSE Manager or designee.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service. If a deficiency cannot be repaired in kind, a team will review the temporary repairs needed to return the equipment to service to allow the use of the equipment or perform a fitness for service evaluation and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Marathon Anacortes Refinery incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases, installation, and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nThe inspection department ensures the fixed equipment assets are mechanically sound and utilizes reliability engineers for support.
