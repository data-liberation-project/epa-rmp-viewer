It may be noted that most of the time, the facility stores less than 24 drums of TDI in the Warm Room and in case of accidental releases, most of the time, the WCS HID will be significantly less than 0.1 mile and could be confined within the facility boundary.\r\n\r\nAs part of the hazard assessment, the facility also conducted an alternative release scenario (ARS) analysis. The ARS was developed based on process hazard analysis (PHA) of the TDI handling and storage at the facility and consisted of slippage of four (4) drums on the forklift at the loading dock of Building 1 (outdoor), puncture of drums and spillage of TDI.  The outdoor scenario was considered for reporting in the RMPlan because of higher potential for impacting the area surrounding the facility.  The release rate to outdoor air for ARS was 0.0129 lbs./minute.  The ARS HID was 0.1 miles, the minimum distance reported in the RMP*COMP software.

      "SummaryText": "C. L. Hauthaway and Sons (Hauthaway) operates a batch chemical manufacturing facility at 638 Summer Street, Lynn, MA.  The facility uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) as a raw material for manufacturing polyurethane product in several reactors within Building 1 of the facility.  TDI is brought into the facility by trucks in 55-gallon drums, through either of the two gates on Summer Street.  The trucks are directed to the unloading docks of Building 1.  At the unloading dock, the TDI drums are inspected by facility personnel for possible loss of integrity and safety.  The drums are then transported by forklifts and stored in a closed area within Building 1 identified as Warm Room.  The TDI drums are stored in the Warm Room on pallets and the room is maintained at an appropriate temperature to prevent solidification of TDI. As and when required in the reactors, TDI drums are transported from the Warm Room to the reactor via forklifts.  Drums of TDI are hoisted to the mezzanine floor on top of the reactors and poured into the reactor at predetermined rate and quantity depending on the process requirements.  TDI is consumed in the reaction and the product and waste streams contain less than 1% TDI.  The empty TDI drums are stored at a specified location within the facility and transported off-site.  There are no other storage or processes for TDI at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility has determined that up to twenty-four (24) TDI drums could be stored at any one time within the Warm Room.  This quantity exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) applicability threshold of 10,000 lbs for TDI.  Therefore, the facility has prepared and submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\r\n\r\nAs part of the RMPlan, the facility has conducted a hazard assessment for accidental release of TDI per USEPA guidelines and using USEPA's RMP*COMP software.
