TDI is brought in the facility by trucks in 55-gallon drums.  The trucks enter the facility from one of the gates on Summer Street.

Trained facility operators inspect the drums and then unload in a batch of 4 drums at a time from the trucks and transport these drums via forklift to the Warm Room, which is the designated storage area for TDI.  TDI is stored in this room on pallettes and the room is maintained at adequate temperature to prevent solidification of TDI.     \n\n      \n\nTDI is used in any of the five reactors U3, U5, U6, U8, and U19.  The process in this reactors are batch processes.  When the process is started, various other raw materisals (both liquid and solid) are filled in the reactor.  TDI drums are taken out of the Warm Room on forklifts by trained operators, hoisted to the mazannaine floor above the reactors by a hoist, and then fed to the opening on the top of tthe reactor by gravity.

      "SummaryText": "C. L. Hauthaway and Sons (Hauthaway) operates a batch chemical manufacturing facility at 638 Summer Street, Lynn, MA.  The facility uses Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) as a raw material for manufacturing polyurethane product in several reactors within Building 1 of the facility.  TDI is brought into the facility by trucks in 55-gallon drums, through either of the two gates on Summer Street.  The trucks are directed to the unloading docks of Building 1.  At the unloading dock, the TDI drums are inspected by facility personnel for possible loss of integrity and safety.  The drums are then transported by forklifts and stored in a closed area within Building 1 identified as \"Warm Room\".  The TDI drums are stored in the Warm Room on pallets and the room is maintained at an appropriate temperature to prevent solidification of TDI. As and when required in the reactors, TDI drums are transported from the Warm Room to the reactor via forklifts.  Drums of TDI are hoisted to the mezzanine floor on top of the reactors and poured into the reactor at predetermined rate and quantity depending on the process requirements.  TDI is consumed in the reaction and the product and waste streams contain less than 1% TDI.  The empty TDI drums are stored at a specified location within the facility and transported off-site.  There are no other storage or processes for TDI at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe facility has determined that up to twenty-four (24) TDI drums could be stored at any one time within the Warm Room.  This quantity exceeds the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) applicability threshold of 10,000 lbs for TDI.  Therefore, the facility has prepared and submitted a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMPlan, the facility has conducted a hazard assessment for accidental release of TDI per USEPA guidelines and using USEPA's RMP*COMP software.  A very conservative worst-case scenario (WCS) of catastrophic release of entire quantity "

      "SummaryText": "of 24 drums stored in the Warm Room was considered.  The release rate to outside air for the worst case scenario was 0.0452 lbs./minute.  The hazard impact distance (HID) to the level of concern of TDI (0.007 mg/L) extended 0.1 miles, which included a commercial facility across the Summer Street and several residences in the vicinity of the facility.  The Saugus River adjacent to the site and the entire site property is an environmental sensitive area (ACEC) designated by the state.  The process was therefore considered a Program Level 3 process for RMPlan.    There were no schools, daycare, senior citizen center, hospitals, prison/correctional facility within the WCS HID.  It may be noted that most of the time, the facility stores less than 24 drums of TDI in the Warm Room and in case of accidental releases, most of the time, the WCS HID will be significantly less than 0.1 mile and could be confined within the facility boundary.\n\n\n\nAs part of the hazard assessment, the facility also conducted an alternative release scenario (ARS) analysis. The ARS was developed based on process hazard analysis (PHA) of the TDI handling and storage at the facility and consisted of slippage of four (4) drums on the forklift at the loading dock of Building 1 (outdoor), puncture of drums and spillage of TDI.  The outdoor scenario was considered for reporting in the RMPlan because of higher potential for impacting the area surrounding the facility.  The release rate to outdoor air for ARS was 0.0129 lbs./minute.  The ARS HID was 0.1 miles, the minimum distance reported in the RMP*COMP software. There were no schools, daycare, senior citizen center, hospitals, prison/correctional facility within the WCS HID.  As mentioned above, the Saugus River adjacent to the site and the entire site property is an environmental sensitive area (ACEC) designated by the state.  \n\n\n\nThe facility did not have any reportable accidental release of TDI in the last five years.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMPlan, a PHA w"
