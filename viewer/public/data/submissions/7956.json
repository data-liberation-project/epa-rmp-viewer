Information includes information pertaining to \nthe hazards of ammonia, process technology, process equipment, and emergency \nresponse procedures.\n\nThe stationary source is the Battle Creek Farmers Cooperative - BC \nSouth anhydrous ammonia storage facility.  The largest ammonia process group \n(e.g., largest storage tank or group of interconnected tanks) has a storage \ncapacity of 30,000 water gallons (140,000 pounds).  The total ammonia stationary \nstorage capacity is 86,000 water gallons or 402,000 pounds (consisting of two \n30,000 water gallon tanks and a 26,000 water gallon tank).  The facility also \nstores numerous smaller transportable tanks (nurse tanks) that are actually \nused in the fertilizer application process.  \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario \nper hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program \napplicability.  Battle Creek Co-op has chosen to use the DEGADIS+ \nrelease model to determine offsite impacts.\n\nFor this facility, a worst-case release would occur in the event that \nthe largest ammonia storage tanks would rupture and the entire contents \nwould be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  The worst-case scenario \nrequires a ground-level release height (0 feet).  Ammonia release rate for \nuse of DEGADIS+ is presented below:\n\nSample Ammonia Endpoint Calculation\n\nGiven:       Storage Tank Capacity is 30,000 water gallons\n             ANSI K61.1 filling density = 56 % (of water wt.)\n\nRelease Rate = Tank Capacity / 10 minutes\n             = (30,000 gal * 8.345 lb/gal water)*(0.56)  / 10 min \n             = (250,350 lb)*(0.56) / 10 min\n             = 140,000 (rounded) / 10 min\n             = 14,000 lb/min \n\nResults of Worst-Case Ammonia Release Scenario\n\nInput of the preceding data into the DEGADIS+ release model, the \nresults indicate a worst-case impac"

The rule defines the toxic endpoint of anhydrous \nammonia to be 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe residential population within a 2.1 mile radius of the facility is \n400 (rounded) based on the 1990 US Census data. \n\nThe facility is required to complete one alternate release scenario per \nregulated chemical per 40 CFR Part 68.165(a)(2).  The alternative \nrelease scenario considered is in accordance with the guidelines \nprovided in 40 CFR 68.22 and 68.28.\n\nThe alternative scenarios chosen for this facility involves a release \nbecause of a sudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this \nscenario is still unlikely because the transfer hoses used have \nmultiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless steel wire \nunderneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it \nis more likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  \nThis scenario is also the most likely to occur, since overfilling is \nprevented by a return vapor line to the tank truck making the delivery.  \nThe transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square inches.  Because \npersonnel are always present at the facility during transfer, Battle Creek \nCo-op personnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated \nusing the OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1). \n\nResults of Ammonia Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThere are 5 people located within 0.23 miles from the facility.  Thus, \nthis alternative release scenario satisfies the conditions of '68.28. \n\nThe facility maintains written process safety information to enable \nemployees involved in handling ammonia to identify and understand the \nhazards posed by this process.
