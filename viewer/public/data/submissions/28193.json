      "SummaryText": "1.  The accidental release prevention and emergency policies at the facility:\n\nThe Na-Churs Alpine Solutions (Na-Churs) facility located at 421 Leader Street, Marion, Marion County County, Ohio complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is Na-Churs policy to adhere to all apllicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia storage system, Na-Churs would immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use.  The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia.  The ammonia storage process consists of two (2) above ground storage tanks (20,000 and 23,000 gallons) and associated piping, valves, pumps, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential failure of the 23,000-gallon storage tank (largest vessel) filled to 90% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each ammonia storage tank to 90% capacity), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.\n\nThe following assumptions/conditions were utilized for the worst-case scenario:\n\n- Administrative controls in place;\n- Passive mitigation (diked area) considered;\n- Spill instantaneously covers diked area; \n- Urban topography; \n- Atmospheric stability class F;\n- Wind Speed of 1.5 meters/second; and\n- Ambient air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius\n\nThe maximum area of the pool was calculated assuming a pool depth of one centimeter and Equation 3-6 of US EPA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, EPA 550-B-99-009, April 1999 (Guidance) as follows:\n\nA = QS ? DF \n\nwhere: A = Maximum area of pool (square feet) for depth of one centimeter\nQS = Quantity released (pounds)\nDF = Density F"

LFA ? A\nwhere: QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n1.4 = Wind speed factor = 1.50^0.78 , where 1.5 meters per second (3.4 miles per 0.78 hour) is the wind speed for the worst case\nLFA = Liquid Factor Ambient (listed in Exhibit B-2, Appendix B)\nA = Diked area (square feet)\n\nUtilizing a computer-based version of the methodology presented in USEPA?s ?Guidance\", RMP*COMP Version 1.07, the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be 0.4 miles.  The public receptors affected under this worst-case scenario include:  a school, a nursing home, private residences, and commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities.  According to a 1999 Environmental Data Resources ? Offsite Receptor Report, the residential population within this 0.4-mile radius is approximately 3,419 persons.\n\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential release of ammonia through the transfer hose (rupture of the connection between the ammonia unloading station piping and the ammonia delivery tanker truck), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.\n\nThe following assumptions/conditions were utilized for the alternative scenario: \n\n- Initial operational flow rate of 200 gallons per minute;\n- Cross sectional area (3? pipe) of 7.065 inches;\n- Operational pipe pressure of 1 atm;\n- Change in pipe elevation of 1 foot;\n- Release duration of 0.3 minutes;\n- Urban topography; \n- Atmospheric stability class D;\n- Wind Speed of 3 meters/second; and\n- Ambient air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius\n \nUtilizing RMP*COMP, the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be < 0.1 miles.  The public receptors affected under this alternate scenario include: private residences, and commercial, "

The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility complies with USEPA?s accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.  The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility has never had an accidental release from the ammonia storage system resulting in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  \n\n7.  The emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency accidental release involving the ammonia storage system. It is Na-Churs? policy to immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.  The Marion Fire Department is aware of this policy.\n\n\n8.
