      "SummaryText": "E (b)\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Water Treatment Plant # 1 employs two full-time employees engaged in water treatment plant and field operations. Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process.\n1.2.1.SITE DESCRIPTION (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach. The site is located at 469 Eleventh Street, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida. The site is boarded by Linkside Drive on the north and east Linkside Court on the west, and 11th Street on the south.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems. These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity. The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption. It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems.\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical. It is an irritant and it is corrosive. Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2. It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable. It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards. Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\n1.3.WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios. The first is a A?worst case releaseA?. The second is a more probable A?alternative release scenarioA?. The first scenari"

The alternative scenario is defined as A?more likely to occur than the worst case scenarioA?.\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the A?toxic endpoint.A? The EPA selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l which equals 3 ppm. The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the A?maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individualA?s ability to take protective action.A? The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, A?to estimate the population potentially affected.A?\n1.3.1.WORST CASE (c)(1)\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions. Results demonstrate a distance of ____ miles to the toxic endpoint. The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at ______ people.\n1.3.2.ALTERNATIVE CASE (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container. Assessment using the EPA water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0lb./min. The toxic endpoint distances determined is ____ miles. The residential population potentially that would be impacted by this release is _____.\n1.4.AC"
