      "SummaryText": "ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT RIVER VALLEY COOPERATIVE, LOST NATION,  IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of three (3) storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is seven (7)\n\n\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 5.6 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles.                                         \n\n\n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-off valves, and emergency shut-off valves. The facility also has a nitrogen shut off system installed. The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main s"

An evacuation plan is in place.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-most current copy with amendments and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Lost Nation Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nOn June 10, 2013, Lost Nation employees were bleeding off anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks into a bleed off tank, so they could do maintenance on the tanks. Employee unhooked the bleed off hoses when the pressure in the tank equalized, and thought the tank was empty. The employee then hooked up the tractor to the nurse tank and started to pull the tank ahead, when the tank moved liquid ammonia in the bottom of the tank came up and out the front liquid withdrawal valve that was still open. That liquid came forward from the tank and made contact with the employee who was driving the tractor. The liquid hit the employee on their lower left and foot area. The release was estimated at least than 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe employee did use the emergency jump water tank for first aid measures. The employee was then taken to a local medica"

Employee returned to work after the medical facility visit with no lost time and no restrictions from work. Employee did not need to go back to the medical facility, as it healed just fine.\n\nThe release was a non-reportable quantity, so no contacts were needed to be made.\n\n\n\nRiver Valley employees shall have all valves fully closed when moving nurse tanks, so this type off an accident does not happen again.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of River Valley  Cooperative  to immediately notify the Lost Nation Volunteer Fire Department and the Clinton County, Iowa LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Lost Nation Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Lost Nation location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Lost Nation has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Clinton County LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhy"

This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.\n\n"
