The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system. The refrigeration system consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the facility, in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is approximately 209,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\n\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices. Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain, and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\n\n\nPerdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans as part of an overall chemical management program. The program involves a wide-range of senior management personnel, including the Vice President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security. Additionally, Perdue "
