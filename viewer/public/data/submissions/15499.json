If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Alice Fire Department, or other authorities, to mimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 154,500 lbs. in one 30,000, and  three 1000 , gallon tanks.  The maximun quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quanity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank  capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .81 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\nFarmers Union Oil Company has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Titl"
