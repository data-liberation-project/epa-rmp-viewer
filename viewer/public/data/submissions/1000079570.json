(ONEOK) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  The ONEOK management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Mont Belvieu Fractionator receives raw feed from several pipelines and fractionates this mix into five separate products. These products are ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.  The products are then delivered via pipeline to third party customers.  Ethane, propane, isobutane and normal butane as well as natural gasoline and raw feed, reported as flammable mixtures, are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Mont Belvieu Fractionator.  At the facility, we have no toxic chemicals above threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\n\n-  Minimizing the possibility that combustion of hydrocarbon vapors would be interrupted by installing automatic pilot ignition and a failure alarm on the flare.\n\n-  Installing a heat-activated sprinkler system in the compressor rooms.\n\n-  Installing hydrocarbon detectors in the compressor room to help ensure that a release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\n-  Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n-  Providing employees and contractors with an orientation on facility operations to help ensure personal safety.\n\n-  Providing a fire water system to help ensure quick response to fires.\n\n-  Providing high level alarms on bullet tanks in order to reduce the possibility of overfilling.  \n\n-  Installing open path gas detectors to detect hydrocarbon releases.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property d"

      "SummaryText": "amage or known offsite impacts from a release of an RMP substance has occurred at the Mont Belvieu Fractionator within the past five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAny emergency response necessary for the Mont Belvieu Fractionator is coordinated, as appropriate, with the Mutual Aid of Mont Belvieu (MAMB), the Mont Belvieu Fire Department, the Chambers County Sheriff and LEPC, the San Jacinto Hospital, and the Texas State Patrol.  The Mont Belvieu Plant Manager, or his designee, is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drills, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\n\n-  The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\n-  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n\n-  The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\n\n\n-  Internal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility"
