As part of this commitment, Ingredion has established a comprehensive safety, health, and environmental management process to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. Ingredion sites operate under a corporate-led Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System. The program details expected practices in areas of Community Awareness and Emergency Response, Pollution Prevention, Process Safety, Employee Health and Safety, Distribution, and Product Stewardship. These management practices govern our daily operations to provide a safe work site for our employees, improve the environment, and contribute to the welfare of our community.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ingredion Cedar Rapids plant utilizes a corn wet milling process to manufacture industrial starches. The manufacturing process for hydroxyethyl starch uses ethylene oxide, a regulated toxic substance which is stored on site above the EPA threshold quantity. The main components of the modified starch process are rail unloading, storage and process tanks, pumps, compressor, and associated piping. Ingredion has established limits on the number of railcars that will be onsite at one time.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Ingredion have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The processes at Ingredion that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Ingredion's PSM program utilized for the prevention of accidental chemical releases at the Cedar Rapids plant includes the following elements: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Management of Chang"

Some of the safety features include release detection and mitigation listed below:\n\n Release Detection\n\n   Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms and process interlocks \n\n   Video monitors and 24-hour security\n\n   Release Containment and Control Scrubbers to neutralize releases \n\n   Automatic and manual valves to permit isolation of process components\n\n   Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n   Curbing or diking to contain releases\n\n   Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n\n\n Release Mitigation\n\n   Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n\n   Deluge systems\n\n   Rapid purge systems for railcar and storage tank \n\n   Trained emergency action personnel (including fire department drills)\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIngredion has an excellent safety record. All incidents associated with regulated substances, including those with the potential to cause any injury or damage, are investigated. The RMP Program regulations require the reporting of accident histories involving regulated substances that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site.

Ingredion maintains a written Integrated Contingency Plan, which is in place to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of actions to take in the event of a release of any hazardous substance. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency action duties including sheltering-in-place and evacuation.\n\n\n\nIngredion workers will only take actions for minor chemical spill events that do not have the potential for significant effects (e.g., small fires or small leaks), and those employees are required to complete additional training. In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the Cedar Rapids Fire Department (HAZMAT).\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Ingredion is coordinated with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and the Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Ingredion has around the clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department) and LEPC officials. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to participating in periodic LEPC meetings, Ingredion conducts periodic emergency drills for all facility personnel and has worked with both the LEPC and emergency response organizations on county-wide chemical emergency response training. Ingredion involves local responders in refresher training on the hazards of regulated substances in the Ingredion facility.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIngredion constantly strives to improve its safety performance and minimize potential impact on the environment.
