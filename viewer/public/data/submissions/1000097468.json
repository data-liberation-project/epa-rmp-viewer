Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident, and to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update.  All accident prevention elements have been updated and/or reviewed.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural fertilizer retail.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The Facility transports empty nurse tanks from the 303 Northwest Road location to the 4197 175th Street location for Nurse Tank filling, and then transports the full Nurse Tanks from the 4197 175th Street location to the 303 Northwest Road location for temporary storage until transported by or to the customer in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.  From the customer location, the empty Nurse Tanks are returned to the 303 Northwest Road location for storage. The covered process equipment includes: multiple nurse tanks and ancillary process piping, transfer hoses, valves, gauges (volume and pressure), and safety systems (excess flow valves).\r\n    \r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWo"

      "SummaryText": "rst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered process that is operated at this Facility.  The covered process includes Nurse Tank Storage and Handling.  The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 1,450-gallon Nurse Tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the Nurse Tank Storage and Handling covered process as well.  The alternative release for the Nurse Tank Storage and Handling assumes a 60-minute release from a Nurse Tank pressure relief valve while in storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as th"
