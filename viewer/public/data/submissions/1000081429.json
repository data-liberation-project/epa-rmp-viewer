If an accidental release should occur, the Water Division is prepared to work with the local fire department and LEPC and other authorities necessary to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nFacility Information - The Iowa City Water Treatment Plant is located at 80 Stephen Atkins Dr. in Iowa City.  The facility went on line in 2003.  The entire facility consists of a river intake, several wells, aeration, lime softening, recarbonation, GAC filtration, fluoridation, chlorination, a computer control room, and adminstrative offices.  The chlorination system is located in the northeast corner of the building.  The facility is located on a 230 acre site with Interstate 80 to the south.  The Iowa River wraps around the nothern and western boundaries of the treatment plant property.  To the east is Dubuque St.  Across Dubuque St. is a residential subdivision called Wendram Bluffs.  KXIC radio station is located SE of the facility site.  Any substantial leak of chlorine gas, inside the chlorine room, will be force-vented to the chlorine scrubber.  Any substantial leak of chlorine outside the chlorine room would have significant off-site impacts on the local area, depending on the wind speed and direction.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program - The Iowa City Water Treatment Facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and our state regulations covering chlorine.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-"

We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If a large release of chlorine takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill, call 911, and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety - Safety improvement is an on-going process at our facilty.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage of the use or the use of chlorine for implementation at this time."
