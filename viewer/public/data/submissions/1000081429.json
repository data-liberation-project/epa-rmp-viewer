The Iowa River wraps around the nothern and western boundaries of the treatment plant property.  To the east is Dubuque St.  Across Dubuque St. is a residential subdivision called Wendram Bluffs.  KXIC radio station is located SE of the facility site.  Any substantial leak of chlorine gas, inside the chlorine room, will be force-vented to the chlorine scrubber.  Any substantial leak of chlorine outside the chlorine room would have significant off-site impacts on the local area, depending on the wind speed and direction.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program - The Iowa City Water Treatment Facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adminstration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and our state regulations covering chlorine.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of chlorine during the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-"
