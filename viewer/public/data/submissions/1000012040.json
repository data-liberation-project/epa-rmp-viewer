Shaws operates many retail grocery stores throughout new england that are supplied through distribution and transportation complex loacted in Methuen, Massachusetts. The Shaws Refrigerated Distribution Center #32711, located on this facility site employs over 420 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anyhdrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Shaw's Methuen distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment. Pursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Shaws (Albertsons) has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals on site. The facility completed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry Standard what-if?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Methuen Facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside Firm.  Shaws (New Albertsons Inc.) implementation of the PSM  program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviewsand management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices  (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements, Shaws (Albertsons) undertook a review of the potential offsi"
