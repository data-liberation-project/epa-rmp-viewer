Since the refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Sunview Vineyards has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.  \n\nAs part of the PSM program, Sunview Vineyards has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration process, established procedures to conduct a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration process on a daily basis, Sunview Vineyards has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration process is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nSunview Vineyards emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  While it is Sunview Vineyards? objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSunview Vineyards has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, Sunview Vineyards audits these programs"

Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility.  The cold storage plant was originally constructed in 1947 and the last expansion of the facility occurred in 1976.\n\nThe refrigeration system at the MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility provides cooling to nine pre-cool and cold storage rooms.  The engine room has two high pressure receivers that supply liquid ammonia to flooded evaporators in the pre-cool and cold storage rooms.  During normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receivers.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest high pressure receiver (HPR2), which is located outdoors, is 11,600 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Sunview Vineyards to address the anhydrous ammonia system at the MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n? Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n? Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed a"

Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility are implemented as needed.\n\n? Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n? Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n? A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all proposed changes to the ammonia system.\n\n? Pre-startup safety reviews will be performed when a modification is made to the ammonia system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n? Audits will be conducted at least every three years to evaluate compliance with the CalARP regulations.\n\n? Incident investigation procedures have been established.\n\n? A written plan of action regarding the implementation of employee participation has been developed and implemented.\n\n? Hot work permits will be issued for all hot work operations conducted on or near the ammonia system, as needed.\n\n? A Contractor Safety Policy has been developed and implemented.\n\nTo ensure that the general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps are implemented, Sunview Vineyards has assigned overall responsibility for the RMP elements to the Safety Supervisor at the MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility.  The Safety Supervisor has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe MZI Earlimart Cold Storage facility has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system within the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite"

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Sunview Vineyards employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.  \n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Sunview Vineyards regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, Sunview Vineyards does not have any changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia-based refrigeration system to improve safety."
