This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  The Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any changes in the facility, personnel, procedures, etc.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Bama Cold Storage facility uses an industrial refrigeration system for the cold storage of various food products.  Ammonia, which is the RMP-regulated chemical maintained onsite, is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process, with a maximum inventory of 69,218 pounds. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cold storage rooms.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nBama Cold Storage complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The facility also follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices using state and local codes and IIAR standards.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to reduce the chance of an accidenta"

Also, level indicators, alarms, and float switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the liquid ammonia supply within the pressure vessels.  Ammonia sensors are installed throughout the facility which will alert plant personnel in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of Bama Cold Storage's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents onsite that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.\n\n\n\nAs required by the RMP regulation, any incidents resulting in an ammonia release or a near miss are investigated following the procedures within the facility's Incident Investigation program.  The objective of the investigation is to determine the root cause of the leak and any contributing factors, and to devise and implement corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the incident.  Incident investigation reports for the last five years are retained onsite.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBama Cold Storage has an Emergency Response Program, which includes procedures for responding to ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite.  The facility has an Emergency Response Team, and team members receive initial 24-hour training and an 8-hour refresher on an annual basis.  Incident Commanders also receive 8-hour initial training and 8-hour annual refresher training.  All team members are fit tested and trained in respiratory protection annually.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance A"
