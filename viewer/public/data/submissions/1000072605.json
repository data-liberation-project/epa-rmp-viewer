      "SummaryText": "Malakoff Water Treatment Plant lies inside the city limits with boundaries delineated by a chain link fence.  The site has appropriate buffers from residential areas.  The Malakoff Water Treatment Plant remains an essential facility for the City of Malakoff.  The plant treats and pumps approximately 75% of the city's potable water.  This treatment plant is the primary source of drinking water for the City of Malakoff's estimated 2,300 residents.\r\n\r\n     Water treatment is the regulated process at this facility.  Chlorine gas disinfects the water making it safe for public consumption.  Chlorine gas for disinfection in water treatment results in one of the most cost-effective methods for meeting state and federal disinfecting rules and regulations.  The plant safely stores no more than a maximum of one (1) one ton container(s) of chlorine.  \r\n\r\n     The Malakoff Water Treatment Plant has written operating procedures based around safety.  All operators must have a Texas state water operator's license from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  All employees who are exposed to chlorine are trained on the dangers of the chemical and how to safely handle the gases.  The plant manager has safety meetings on an annual basis.  At these meetings overall plant safety is discussed with employees.  \r\n\r\nThe Malakoff Water Treatment Plant complies with the rules and regulations of the EPA RMP.  The most important preventative measure for avoiding accidental release involves the gas feed systems.  Due to the design of the chlorine process, the gas will cease to flow when a gas line has a leak or breaks.  This ensures that any failure in the process equipment will cease gas flow which eliminates the chances of a chlorine release.  A small chlorine room on the exterior of the building is where the one ton containers will be stored.  This enclosure has a hatch lid that can be removed for change-out of the chlorine containers.  The enclosure will have ventilation for the chlor"

During installation of the chlorine feed system the addition of gas detectors in the process area that will alarm personnel that a leak has occurred was considered.  This facility is not online unless it is manned.\r\n\r\n     All operators are trained in the written operating procedures.  Preventative maintenance procedures determine the schedule for changing out wearable parts on a regular basis to avoid corrosion. For example, tubing and connections ( pigtails) shall be changed out annually or at any sign of deterioration and all gaskets are replaced after any servicing.  Daily inspections of the storage area and process area ensure that all valves and components are capable of proper shut down to isolate and stop leaks.  In addition the SCBA's are tested on a annual basis for proper care and functioning.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n     The City of Malakoff Water Treatment Plant has not had any accidental releases within the last five years that resulted in personal injury or property damage offsite or onsite.  This is due to an exceptional training program and the overall design of the systems at this plant.\r\n\r\n     Under the City of Malakoff and/ or Henderson County Emergency Management Plan, response procedures will be implemented, as required.  Any incidence of toxic or hazardous chemical leak or spill subject to off-site contamination will result in a 911 call by Department personnel requesting a HAZMAT Team respond to the emergency.  \r\n\r\n    Malakoff Water Utilities complies with Federal and State HAZCOM reporting requirements, thus all chemical quantities and storage locations shall be on file with the Malakoff Fire Department and Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC).

      "SummaryText": "y Response personnel will implement evacuation procedures in accordance with the Emergency Management Plan.  The State Emergency Response Commission has approved the emergency management Plan.  In addition the same firm which has prepared this report was given a copy of the mandated vulnerability assessment and the Emergency Response Plan conducted by the current operator.  All of the findings were reported to and communicated with the City of Malakoff and the Henderson County emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n     The Malakoff Water Treatment Plant has improved safety and offsite impacts with improved mitigation.  The chlorine cylinder storage area is an enclosure that is enclosed on three sides and bolted to the concrete so the building wall serves as the fourth side.  The enclosure will be bolted to the concrete pad and removed for exchange of the one ton containers.  This building was designed to meet all current rules, codes, and regulations. \r\n\r\n\tIn addition, the feed system has been designed with diaphragm type vacuum regulators on the chlorine gas to automatically shutoff system.  The Enchlor Chlorine Feed System is an all vacuum operated system and offers the highest degree of operator safety.    The feed system consists of the E2000 vacuum regulators which mount on the chlorine containers, a wall mounted flow meter with manual control valve, the injector with nozzle and diffuser, and appropriate polyethylene tubing.  The \"All Vacuum System\" will shut off at the cylinder valve should the vacuum line be broken, if water is stopped for any reason, or if the chlorination equipment is physically damaged.  This offers a redundancy of safety features to protect the plant employees and the citizens of Malakoff, Texas.  Plant personnel involved in the chlorine disinfection aspect of the plant shall be thoroughly trained in the use, maintenance and inspection of this equipment."
