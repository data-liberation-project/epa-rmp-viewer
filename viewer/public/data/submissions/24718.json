The facility Policy.\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Eldon C. Stutsman, Inc. are commited to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Washington County LEPC, local FD, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored at our facility would be 480,000 in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 52,428 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point is 2.4 miles. \nb. The most likely alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The maximum quantity release would be 26,638 pounds. The distance to the endpoint is 1.6 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of  \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1,\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1919.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property dam"

The emergency action plan.\nThe facility has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc. Washington County LEPC phone number is (319) 657-2762.\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
