Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we occasionally handle hydrofluoric acid solutions above 50% concentration, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make hydrofluoric acid solutions valuable as a commodity chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle hydrofluoric acid solutions, and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis facility does not have an emergency response program designed to handle hydrofluoric acid releases.  Our emergency action plan is coordinated with the City of Dallas Fire Department and we are prepared to assist them in the event of an emergency.  Our Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis facility stores for distribution and repackages a wide variety of industrial chemicals.  One chemical we occasionally store is a 70% Hydrofluoric Acid solution.  We more frequently store 49% Hydrofluoric Acid solutions.  These solutions are stored in drums and are sold to the metal treatment and other industries.  Hydrofluoric Acid solutions are received, stored, and delivered to our customers in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers with a capacity of 55 gallons or less.  No manufacturing, use, or repackaging of hydrofluoric acid solutions is done at this facility.  The maximum total inventory of hydrofluoric acid solutions (70% concentration) is 45,000 pounds.  Average inventories are much less and we often have no inventory \n\n\n3."

This facility is operated in accordance with the guidelines of the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility does not have an emergency response program but does have an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  The Emergency Action Plan is coordinated with the City of Dallas Fire Department and we are prepared to assist them in the event of an emergency.  Our Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.  We are part of this area\u00bfs emergency response program and work closely with the Fire Department to improve safety.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1949.  We have made numerous improvements throughout the years including the recent addition of a sprinkler system and spill containment curbing in the warehouse.  When this facility was first built, the surrounding area was largely undeveloped.  Because of recent development in the area, as well as new security requirements, we have eliminated the storage and use of other, more hazardous chemicals.  We will continue to participate in National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nIn 2003, we develope"
