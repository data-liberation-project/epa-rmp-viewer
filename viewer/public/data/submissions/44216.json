ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSweeny Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs, and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nII.  DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSweeny Refinery consists of four major facilities, which are linked by multiple pipelines and operates as a single unit. The main plant, near Old Ocean, Texas, is at the intersection of State Highway 35 and FM 524, about 60 miles southwest of downtown Houston. We also operate terminals and storage facilities in Freeport, Jones Creek, and San Bernard, along with the pipelines that connect these facilities to the main plant and its markets. The refinery covers approximately 3,000 acres at the four locations, the plant processes 213,000 barrels per day of crude oil and produces 115,000 barrels per day of gasoline. In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant, offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  HF Acid, Chlorine, Ammonia-anhydrous \n\nFlammables: 1-Butene; 1-3-Butadiene; 2-Butene; 2-Butene-trans; 2-Butene-cis; 2-Pentene; 2-2-Dimethylpropane; 3-Methyl-1-Butene; Acetylene (ethyne); Butene; Ethane; Ethylene; Hydrogen; Isobutane; Isopentane; Isoprene; Methane; Normal Butane; Pentane; Propadiene; Propane; Propylene; Vinyl Acetylene (1-Buten-3-yne); \n\n\nIII.

      "SummaryText": "k Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite effects of releases of regulated hazardous substances.  Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario.  The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure and that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The ARS represents a more credible, but still significant, accidental release of regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS.  However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may have not been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios.  In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, various information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. was considered. \n \n\nNote:  For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios has been removed from Executive Summary.\n\n\nIV.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the Sweeny Refinery. Because processes at the plant are subject to both EPA RMP and  OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance, this summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the Accident Prevention Program.\n\nA.  Employee Participation\n\nSweeny Refinery management encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team."

In addition, Sweeny Refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and employee safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\nPersonnel representing operations, maintenance, office, and management work together on the Employee Excellence Team to represent the employees and address the following elements of the facility Operating Excellence Plan:\n\n* Behavior Awareness (Employee Behavioral Safety Process (VIPER), Safety in Motion - ergonomics)\n* Employee Ownership (traffic safety, general safety, safety concerns, and tracking system)\n* Waste Minimization (recycle program, waste prevention and minimization)\n* Safety Standards and Procedures (review, edit, create, and Performed-Based Self Audits)\n\nB.  Process Safety Information\n\nSweeny Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.   Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information. Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as. Part of .the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nSweeny Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nC.  Process Hazard Analysis\n\nSweeny Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled: Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nSweeny Refinery primarily uses the HAZard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are identified and forwarded to the respective team management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk rece"

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Sweeny Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nD.  Operating Procedures\n\nSweeny Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nIn addition, Sweeny Refinery maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nE.

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nF.  Contractors\n\nSweeny Refinery uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished, by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Sweeny Refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to help ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations. Contractors regularly participate in facility emergency drills.\n\nG.  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nSweeny Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facil"

Sweeny Complex incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSweeny Refinery has developed a team-based defect elimination process known as TPM (Team Perfected Manufacturing). The objective of this process is to eliminate equipment failures through predictive/ preventive maintenance and improve in operating reliability and safety.\n\nI.  Safe Work Practices\n\nSweeny Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a. Lockout/Tagout Procedure to verify isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space, and (6) a Safety and Emergency Systems Bypass Permit procedure.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nJ.  Management of Change\n\nSweeny Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage change. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nK.  Incident Investigation\n\nSweeny Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the Root Cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years in order for reports to be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nL.  Compliance Audits.\n\nTo confirm the Accident Prevention Program is functioning properly, Sweeny Refinery periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented. Formal compliance audits are conducted at least every 2 years. In addition, Sweeny conducts internal self audits on a semiannual basis and annual evaluations on Sweeny's Operating Excellence Plan Process.

HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite effects of releases of regulated hazardous substances.  Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario.  The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure and that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The ARS represents a more credible, but still significant, accidental release of regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS.  However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may have not been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential"

Contractor employees were in the process of gas-freeing the out-of-service storage tank for maintenance when a flash fire occurred.  No offsite impact was associated with this incident.\r\n\r\n* On 06/07/2004, an incident involving a flammable mixture release and fire from process Unit 26.1 ARDS resulted in an employee recordable injury and property damage.  Employees were in the process of isolating an exchanger for maintenance to repair a tube leak when the exchanger pressured up and released the flammable mixture through a vent line and igniting.  \r\n\r\n* On 3/21/2005, an incident involving a flammable mixture from process Unit 9 Crude Still resulted in property damage.  While in the process of starting up the unit\u00bfs heater, fuel gas built up inside the heater firebox and ignited, causing an explosion inside the firebox.  No employee injuries or offsite impact was associated with this incident.    \r\n\r\nThe Sweeny Refinery has a formal written incident investigation process that is designed to identify root causes of incidents and develop appropriate corrective actions to prevent recurrence.  Risk assessments are also made of incidents.  However, the Sweeny Refinery\u00bfs focus and philosophy is in the area of preventing accidents, and controls and measures are developed and implemented to help accomplish this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery incident is carefully investigated to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\r\nVI.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first\u001eaid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post\u001eincident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Sweeny RefineryComplex has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The Emergency Response Program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Sweeny RefineryComplex is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Sweeny RefineryComplex has around\u001ethe\u001eclock\u001ecommunications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Sweeny RefineryComplex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. In addition to the LEPC, the Sweeny R"
