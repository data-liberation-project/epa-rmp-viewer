Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency response plan and has coordinated response activities with the Schuyler Fire Department.\n\nThis facility produces beef products for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Ammonia is used for mechanical refrigeration throughout the plant for all areas that require cooling. The refrigeration system includes receiving tanks, compressors, chillers, freezers and condensers, and associated piping, valves, and other equipment. The facility also processes methane from biogas generated in the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nOur worst-case release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration system is the failure of an accumulator vessel, resulting in a release of 92,000 pounds of ammonia. The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 5.4 miles according to the look-up tables provided in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidance document for ammonia refrigeration systems. Public receptors identified within 5.4 miles of the facility include residences, schools, a hospital, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas. A state wildlife area is also located within 5.4 miles of the facility. An alternative release scenario was also analyzed. The alternative release scenario examined a release of ammonia from the same vessel as analyzed in the worst-case release scenario but under normal operating conditions and more likely weather conditions. The quantity of ammonia released for this scenario was determined to be 28,000 pounds. The distance to endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 1.0 miles. Public receptors identified within 1.0 miles of the facility include residences and a recreational area. No environmental"

      "SummaryText": " receptors were identified.\n\nOur worst-case scenario for the methane biogas system is a vapor cloud explosion of 30,290 pounds of methane. The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 0.26 miles. No public or environmental receptors were identified within a 0.26-mile radius of the facility. An alternative release scenario was also analyzed for the methane biogas system. The scenario assumed a release of 30,290 pounds of methane over a ten minute time period. The endpoint for this analysis is the lower flammable limit of methane, and the resulting distance to endpoint is 0.2 miles. No public or environmental receptors were identified within 0.2 miles of the facility.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulation. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition, we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia or methane that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n \nIn the event of an emergency involving ammonia or methane, we will implement our emergency response plan.
