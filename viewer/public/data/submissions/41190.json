Box 80, Gothenburg, NE  69138\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFACILITY POLICY:\n\nThe management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations.  In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company, Emergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\" however, we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the recieving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle crop protectants and petroleum products which are included in our planning, training and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.  During the balance of the year, little if any product transfer occurs.  For approximately one week per year, Anhydrous Ammonia may be included in a process ( T-reactor ) of blending to make a 10-34-0"

      "SummaryText": "starter grade of liquid fertilizer.   \n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour rerquirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilities have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculations.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) miles based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06) as well as possible public and environmental receptorswithin the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThere has not  been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flwo valves, so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is calculated per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guiedelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".
