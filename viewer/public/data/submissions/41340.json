Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Agriform's Woodland facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1,000 North East Street, Woodland, California, 95776 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia and ammonium polyphosphate. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by rail-car and stored in one 38,887-gallon rail-car and 18,000-gallon and one 22,400 gallon storage tank (bullets) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 373,500 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight)  is produced at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 416,000-gallon above ground tanks at the site.
