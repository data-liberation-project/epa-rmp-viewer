Dead River management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the environmental, health and safety management systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors and through open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility. This will meet the requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program in 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance \n\nThe X229 Track in Auburn, ME, is owned and operated by the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad. At the facility, railcars are stored on the property until procurement can find a suitable market for the liquids. Odorized propane is the only substance regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) that is present at the facility in amounts above the threshold quantity. The facility is classified as Program Level 2 under the regulation because it is a remote, unmanned facility used for storage of railcars only.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Dead River. These high standards include:\n\n?    operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations; \n\n?    operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized; \n\n?    operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that"

      "SummaryText": " small releases associated with normal operating and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible; and\n\n?    correcting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe X229 Track facility does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational, Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. The facility does, however, operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees and emphasis on safety has helped avoid serious accidental releases since operations began. Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental releases.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death, property damage, or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the X229 Track facility within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nDead River has never had an accident involving propane that caused or might have caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelters-in-place.  In the event of an emergency involving the propane facilities described herein, it is Dead River's policy to notify the Auburn Fire Department and SLR officials to coordinate an emergency response.  Dead River will also utilize its in-house trained fire brigade.  Dead River maintains a First Response Vehicle at its Hampden, ME, location that is available for use at any location during emergencies.  For major emergency response, Dead River has agreements with private emergency response contractors to provide these resources when and where needed on a 24-hour basis.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a 30,000-gallon railcar resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.4 miles, and there are approximately 0 people and no residenc"

The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite 0.1 miles with 0 people and no residences within this distance.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions at 40 CFR 68 and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane storage and transfer equipment were designed, installed, and are maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 \"Liquified Petroleum Gas Code\" and applicable state laws and rules including those implemented by the Vermont Division of Fire Safety.\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities is organized into 9 Sections.  Since this facility only has flammable chemicals and no toxic chemicals covered under 40 CFR 68, and because it is a Program 2 Propane Storage facility with no history of accidents, several of the sections do not apply.  The table below shows the equivalency between the organization of the guidance document and the Dead River RMP.   \n\n \n\n\n\n"
