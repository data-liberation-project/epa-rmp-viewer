Finally, because this facility is subject to the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards, the RMP's are designed to meet the specific requirements of those standards as well.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nIt is WM's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. WM is committed to protect the health and safety of its employees and the public. In order to achieve this objective, WM has allocated and invested considerable resources in implementing reasonable controls to prevent predictable releases of LNG and LCNG by training its employees, by the safe design, installation, maintenance and operation of this facility, and by installing fire and leak detection and mitigation systems. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nWM's Altamont Landfill and Resource Recovery Facility is located at 10840 Altamont Pass Road in unincorporated Alameda County near Livermore, California.  The facility is approximately 2.1 miles north of Interstate 580 and 16 miles east of Interstate 680.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly undeveloped with the closest industrial buildings located approximately 2 miles away.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two regulated processes onsite that both use LNG: Altamont LNG facility and LCNG Fueling Station.  Methane, which is the major component of LNG, is considered hazardous by the USEPA. LNG is a flammable liquefied gas. It is stored at -258.7 degrees C. It is a clean burning fuel.\n\n\n\nAltamont LNG F"

      "SummaryText": "acility:\n\nThe Altamont LNG facility is owned by WM and operated by Linde, LLC. The primary purpose of this facility is to convert landfill gas to LNG. The LNG will be dispensed at the facility into trucks for transport to an off-site facility where it will be used for fueling vehicles. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum intended inventory of LNG for this process is 180,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nLCNG Fueling Station:\n\nThe LCNG Fueling Station is owned and operated by WM.  The process employed in the fueling station involves converting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to compressed natural gas (CNG), which in turn will be used as a fuel to power solid waste transfer trucks operated by Waste Management. Typical operating conditions range from 60-110 psig on the low pressure LNG system to 4,200 psig on the CNG side.  Construction of the fueling system began in 2011, with operations beginning in March 2012.  The system's maximum intended inventory of 50,750 pounds.  \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by WM to prevent the accidental release of LNG or LCNG at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before LNG is introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. we"

The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of LNG and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\n\n\nIn addition, to ensure worker and community safety, the facility includes numerous mechanisms for preventing accidents. These include designing the facility to meet all current design standards (including National Fire Protection Association [NFPA]-59A [Standard for the Production, Storage, and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas] for the Altamont LNG Facility, NFPA-52 [Vehicular Gaseous Fuel Systems Code] for the LCNG Fueling Station, and those applicable to earthquake safety); regular facility maintenance; worker training regarding facility operation, safe LNG handling procedures, and response to accidents; leak and fire detection systems; emergency shutdown procedures; and compliance audits. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of LNG from the Altamont LNG facility since it began operations in 2009.  The five-year accident history is not applicable to the LCNG Fueling Station as it is a new process. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWM has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n \n\n?    save lives;\n\n?    minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n?    protect the environment; and\n\n?    minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, LNG health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency response at this facility will be handled by the Alameda County Fire Department.  Facility personnel will not be expected to perform emergency response activities apart from: 1) reporting an incident (LNG leak or fire) when it occurs, 2) activating any facility-wide notification system, and 3) evacuating the facility to a safe loca"

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  Waste Management is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility's safety plans/programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in the development of the facility's safety plans/programs.\n\n\n\n3. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n\n\n"
