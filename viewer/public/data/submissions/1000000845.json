This Plan has been developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68, A?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.A?  The purpose of these provisions and this RMP is to prevent the accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public and to the environment.\nThis RMP was originally developed by the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility consultant, Tighe & Bond, Inc., specifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and handling operations at the Holyoke facility.  The RMP provides a summary of the risk management program implemented at the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility and was developed following the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s guidance documents for the regulated chemicals.  The RMP is available to government agencies and the public for review.\nTighe & Bond has performed the requisite review and regulatory update necessary for covered facilities on their five year RMP Submission Anniversary.  This March 4, 2009 review included:\nA?    A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the covered process using a methodology involving checklists developed from the EPA RMP Guidance, as well as a physical inspection of the covered process;\nA?    Performance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data revised from the year 2000 census; and\nA?    A general review of operating and maintenance procedures with facility operations and environmental personnel.\nThe following items provide an overview of the Holyoke Water Treatment FacilityA?s RMP in accordance with 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n1.2    Facility Description and Covered Process\nThe City of Holyoke B.O.W.C. owns and operates the City of Holyoke Water Treatment Facility.

The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the chlorinators and is directly injected into the treatment locations.\nThe City of Holyoke Water Treatment Facility currently stores up to 28,000 pounds of chlorine in fourteen one-ton containers.  Since the City of Holyoke Water Treatment Facility stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine, the facility is required to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n1.3    Release Scenarios\nA worst case release scenario and two alternative release scenarios were performed and documented in the original RMP filing.  These scenarios were re-calculated for the five year anniversary updating population and receptor information.  Based on guidelines provided by the EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\n1.4    Administrative and Engineering Controls\nThe Holyoke Water Treatment Facility has implemented a prevention program (RMP Program 2) to administratively limit the potential for a worst case or alternative release.  No passive measures, however, were taken to minimize the impacts of these releases.  Specific measures employed in this program include safety reviews, hazard reviews, operating procedure reviews, training and maintenance and inspection.  These reviews are conducted, consistent with the operation of the covered process, once (1) every three (3) years in association with the Holyoke Water Treatment Facility Compliance Audit (40 CFR 68.58) or with major changes.  The hazard review is required every five (5) years or with major changes.  Maintenance and inspection is conducted at specific intervals as outlined in the Holyoke Water Treatment FacilityA?s RMP.  The results of the most recent reviews are also maintained at the facility.\n\n1.5    Mitigation Measures\nCertain engineering controls are used to mitigate the potential effects "
