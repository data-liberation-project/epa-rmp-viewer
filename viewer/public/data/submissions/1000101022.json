Every entered incident or recommendation is reviewed by the facitlity's Incident Review Team with actions assigned and tracked to completion as necessary.\r\n\r\n4.1.11 Hot Work Permits\r\nThe Ashtabula Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  A hot work permit is required for personnel who are to perform hot work in any area of the plant containing chemical hazards.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u00a7 68.155(d)): \r\n\r\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant's fence line.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Ashtabula Plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Ashtabula Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\n4.1.1 Process Safety Information\r\nThe Ashtabula Plant maintains technical documents which are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant; (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant; and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant. Huntsman ensures that this process safety information is available to all employees.\r\n\r\nSafety data sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes. The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\r\n* Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\r\n* Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\r\n* Reactivity and corrosivity data\r\n* Thermal and chemical stability data\r\n* Hazards of mixing substances in the process\r\n\r\nSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the Product Manual (see below).

It is stored as a liquefied gas in a railroad tankcar and flows to the process through carbon steel piping.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (\u00a7 68.155(c)):\r\n\r\nThe Ashtabula Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario. However, Huntsman does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nALOHA 5.4.7 and MARPLOT were used for evaluating the endpoint distances for the worst-case scenarios and the alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst cases and average meteorological values for the alternative release scenarios. The MARPLOT program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within endpoint distance from the storage location and to identify the public and environmental recepto"

Huntsman's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, Huntsman strives to minimize impacts from an accidental release: In the event of an accidental release, the Ashtabula Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Huntsman utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Huntsman trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, Huntsman works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Huntsman has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Ashtabula County, Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (AC-CAER).\r\n\r\nAshtabula Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Ohio and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ashtabula Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Ashtabula County-CAER Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\r\n\r\nHuntsman is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness. In addition, the Ashtabula Plant demonstrates community commitment by providing involvement and leadership in important local organizations such as the local Safety Council. The Ashtabula Plant was a founding member of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which was formed in 1994. Safety is a primary concern in our facility"

In fact, the Ashtabula Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental management program in place that complies with ISO 14001 and 45001, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as preventing injuries and damage from such a release.\r\n\r\nHuntsman's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Ashtabula Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, Huntsman reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and/or Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for new installations, as well as modifications of existing processes that handle hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nHuntsman strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: Huntsman implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, Huntsman requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures"
