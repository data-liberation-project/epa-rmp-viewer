The purpose of this document is to provide an Enhanced Risk Management Plan that meets the TCEQ NSRPD Disaster Review requirements.  This document addresses the new chemicals proposed in this permit application that exceed the threshold quantities as defined in the NSRPD Draft Disaster Review Technical Guidance Document, January 2001.  This Risk Management Plan summarizes the managerial, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan definitions and requirements:\n\n* Introduction\n* Arkema Inc. Policies to Protect Health, Environmental, and Safety\n* Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n* Hazard Assessment\n* Prevention Program\n* Five-Year Accident History\n* Emergency Response Plan\n\nARKEMA INC. POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\nArkema Inc. is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the Beaumont plant.  The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities.\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer.  Senior Management routinely dedicates time to review HES matters. This emphasis on safety is carried on at all levels of the plant.  The Beaumont plant has a safety committee that meets monthly to discuss HES topics.  The succe"

These materials include Risk Management Program guidance used by our facility in the development and implementation of risk prevention and reduction programs associated with potential accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES IN COVERED PROCESSES\n\nThe Arkema Inc. - Beaumont facility is located at 2810 Gulf States Road in Beaumont, Texas.  This facility currently manufactures Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan.  Methyl Mercaptan is used to produce photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and Methionine, a synthetic amino acid used in animal feed supplement.  Ethyl Mercaptan is used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and pesticides.  Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  An RMP has been previously filed with the EPA and presented to the public.  Methyl Mercaptan, Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon DiSulfide and Ethyl Mercaptan are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability. \n\nRecently submitted RMPs (2002 and 2003) included a new chemical substance, acrolein, which will be present in sufficient qualities in the new plant expansion.  This plant expansion was permitted in early 2003, with construction nearly complete.  Startup of the new plant is expected as soon as April, 2005.  In addition to acrolein, the chemical substance allyl alcohol will be present in a quantity greater than 500 pounds but less than 1000 lbs.  This Enhanced Risk Management Plan will address acrolein.  Acrolein will be used as an intermediate product to manufacture Methylmercaptopropionaldehyde (MMP).  MMP is formed by reacting MeSH and Acrolein.  \n\nHAZARD"

      "SummaryText": " ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic failure of the Acrolein storage tank.   Acrolein is stored as a liquid in a temperature controlled storage tank.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Acrolein stored to 80% of the tank liquid capacity and has three separate storage tanks within an enclosed area with diking.  In an emergency, material may be transferred from one tank to another storage tank.  This quantity (149,500 pounds) is assumed to be released into the diked area and evaporates over 172 minute period.  \n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions, the release could produce an Acrolein vapor plume that could travel up to 25 (using EPA RMP-Comp) miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public and the environment.  It should be noted that the worst case scenario is recognized by the regulatory agency and Arkema Inc. as an extremely unlikely event.  Arkema Inc. has mitigation and prevention programs implemented to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident from occurring.\n\nFLAMMABLE WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst case accidental release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a catastrophic failure of an Ethyl Mercaptan storage tank.  It is stored as a liquid.  Administrative controls limit the quantity of Ethyl Mercaptan stored to 90-% to the tank liquid capacity.  This quantity (2,000,000 pounds) is assumed to be released over a 10 minute time period as a vapor.\n\nHazard assessment data indicates that, under worst case conditions, the potentially affected area is a maximum distance of 0.90 (EPA Look-up Table) miles which corresponds to end point distance of a 1psi over pressure.  Again, it is noted that the worst case scenario is an extremely unlikely event and Arkema Inc. has implemented mitigation and prevention programs to reduce the likelihood of a worst case incident"

In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community.  \n\nIn accordance with the guidelines used to define worst case incidents, active mitigation measures were not considered in modeling the worst case scenarios.  However, the significant mitigation measures (including for this new project) will effectively reduce the risk and consequences associated with a RMP worst case incident.  Mitigation measures include:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress vapor.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times.\n\n* Member of area Mutual-Aid organization.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ? METHYL MERCAPTAN\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic failure of the Methyl Mercaptan storage sphere.  This scenario involves the release of 1,300,00 pounds of Methyl Mercaptan.  Under atmospheric stability class F conditions, the vapor plume was estimated to travel 19.0 miles based on a 10-minute release.   \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS MITIGATION MEASURES\n\nWhile the Alternative Release Scenarios are, by definition, more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, they are still very unlikely to occur due to the facility?s existing release and accident prevention program.  If a release should occur, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential human health and environmental receptor impact.  The prevention program elements in place at Beaumont are:\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to                    "

On December 21, 2001 the facility had a release of 13,044 lbs of SO2, 650 lbs of H2S, 321 lbs of MeSH, 0.311 lbs of EtSH, 7.841 lbs of Dimethyl Sulfide, and 36.33 lbs of Carbon DiSulfide.  This release resulted in the voluntary shelter in place and/or evacuation for employees of our industrial neighbor located north of the facility.  On August 04, 2003, the facility had a release of 476 pounds of Hydrogen Sulfide and 118 pounds of Methyl Mercaptan.  This release resulted in the evacuation of the employees of our industrial neighbor located north of the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE STATEMENT\n\n \nThe Arkema Inc.- Beaumont facility maintains a written Site Emergency Response Plan.  The plan includes the procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an accidental release.  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are maintained to provide appropriate medical treatment and first aid necessary in response to an accidental human exposure.  All employees and contractors are trained in the plan and drills are conducted on an annual basis.  The plan provides response guidelines for employee use to respond to liquid spills, gas releases, and fires.  The plan is updated as necessary based on review of incidents or drills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\\\Abmntsfp01\\BMNT-DPT-Shared\\ENV\\Env_Oper_Record\\00_Naught-Naught\\A_00\\RMP_Program\\Executive Summary 2005.doc"
