Up-to-date comprehensive emergency response and contingency programs are in place. Facility personnel are trained on and are familiar with these programs to allow the facility to safely and properly respond to accidental chemical releases.\n\n1.2\tGeneral description of the stationary source and regulated substances\nThis facility manufactures a variety of non-hazardous water-based emulsions that are used by our customers to produces waste based paints and other household and industrial products.  The SIC and NAICS codes that describe this activity are 2421 and 325211, respectively.  The facility occupies an overall area of approximately ten acres between Alondra Boulevard on the south and Macaw Street on the north in the city of La Mirada. The polymer manufacture area is located in the northwest area of the facility.\n\nThe regulated substances in use at this facility that is covered by the RMP is Vinyl Acetate. Vinyl acetate is a monomer that is a colorless liquid with a sweetish odor. It is flammable and toxic.  Vinyl acetate is delivered to the facility in 24,000 gallon railcars specifically designed to contain up to 75 pounds of pressure per square inch. The vinyl acetate is transferred from railcar via dedicated transfer lines to one of two 50,000 gallon underground storage tanks (UST) designed to meet federal and state UST requirements.  Vinyl acetate is used in the manufacture of water-based emulsions.  Process vessels that contain vinyl acetate for the manufacture of these emulsions are instrumented and alarmed to notify process personnel of potential unusual pressures and temperatures.  Process feed rates are controlled automatically to manage the reaction, a"

Safety and Operations Procedures have been written for the activities from the facility that can impact human health and the environment.  All involved personnel are required to read and sign-off on these procedures. Operators and mechanics are required to pass hands-on and written tests to be certified on their particular positions and refresher certifications are required every 3-years there-after.  Periodic safety meetings are held to provide training on specific safety topics. Computer-based training programs are often established for annual refreshers on many safety topics. Preventative maintenance programs are in place to ensure the continued mechanical integrity of equipment, piping and vessels. Physical safeguards (such as the pressure rated railcars, double walled USTs, instrumentation/alarms for detection and identification of potential unusual process parameters, pressure-rated process vessels, and thermal oxidation interlocked with the process) are utilized to minimize the chances of hazardous chemicals, and specifically vinyl acetate, to be accidentally released from the process. \n\nProcess safety information has been compiled pertaining to the hazards of regulated substances and the technology of the process.  A HAZOP study ha been  performed and findings and recommendations have been documented, along with a schedule of assigned"

Pre-startup reviews are conducted for all new sources and significant modifications to existing sources.  Incidents that result in or have the potential to results in catastrophic release of a regulated substance are investigated within 48 hours of the event.  Employee participation in programs is provided for and encouraged. A Safety Permit system has been developed to identify specific requirements for certain types of activities and a contractor safety program is in place.\n\n1.5 \tSummary of the five-year accident history\nThere has been no accidental releases of vinyl acetate at the Rohm and Haas Company La Mirada Facility that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage in the past 5 years.\n\n1.6 \tSummary of emergency response program\nIn the unusual event that the written procedures, personnel training programs and physical safeguards in place at this facility are unsuccessful in preventing an accidental release of hazardous chemicals, Rohm and Haas Company La Mirada Facility has established a comprehensive Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for responding to a release in a safe and organized manner.  This plan provides the requirements for evacuation of the facility; notification of emergency responders, agency contacts and industrial neighbors; emergency first-aid or medical treatment for human exposure; coordination of the in-house Incident Command System; use of personal protective equipment; response to specific events (including external events such as earthquakes); reporting; and Plan review and up-dating.

The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methodology selected to best determine and evaluate the hazards of the process was HAZOP \u00bf Hazard and Operability Study. All HAZOP\u00bfs are performed by a team having engineering, process operations and HAZOP methodology expertise.\n\n1.7.2\tSeismic Walk-Down\n\tA thorough Seismic Assessment was performed in December of 1995.  This assessment of the piping and components in vinyl acetate service. The most recent walk-down was performed by a registered civil engineer on May 19, 2004 and documented on forms. Both the 1995 Seismic Assessment and the up-dated walk-down forms are included in section (Tab 8) of this report. The only item identified during the 2004 walk-down was related to a missing anchor bolt on a piping support. This deficiency is scheduled for correction by August 1, 2004."
