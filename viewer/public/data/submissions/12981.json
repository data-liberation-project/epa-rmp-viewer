      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCacique, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMPP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly areas, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Cacique facility was initially built in 1961 and was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 14940 Proctor Ave., City of Industry, CA 91746 and began operation in 1985.\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is largely industrial complexes with some residential areas.  The facility covers approximately 4 acres and is situated approximately 1.5 miles north of State Highway 60, and 0.25 miles south of Valley Boulevard.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 19,000 pounds of ammonia within a closed system for the purpose of manufacturing cheese products.  The entire charge of ammonia can be held within the High Pressure Receiver.  The system cycles ammonia through various physical states in order to provide cooling in the cheese production processes and cold storage rooms.  The facility remains one of the most sophisticated cheese manufacturing facilities in the world.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 19,000 pounds in 10 minutes.  The release rate was calculated to be 1,900 poun"

The reference table, Exhibit 4-4, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 2,000 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia gas from a 1/4 inch diameter leak.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 126 pounds per minute.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability. The reference table, Exhibit 4-5, from the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for a release of 150 pounds per minute.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe facility is equipped with an automatic shut off button which stops the flow of ammonia from the low pressure receiver to the rest of the system.  If a release were to occur, operators can activate this prevention measure.  The facility is staffed 24 hours a day and at least one maintenance personnel is on site 24 hours a day.  The majority of the ammonia equipment is located next to the parts room where a release can be detected visually or audibly immediately. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere is no accident history at this facility within the past five years (June 1994 to June 1999).\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCacique has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur, Cacique will determine the extent of the emergency.  They will actuate th"

They will call 911 in order to reach the Los Angeles County Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRecommendations made during the initial Process Hazard Analysis, June 5, 1995, and the update October 15, 1996, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Cacique facility.  Cacique plans to create a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program (PSM/RMP) that will include a revalidation of the past Hazard and Operability Studies that were perfomed on June 5, 1995 and November 11, 1996.  This PSM/RMP will also include training and maintenance programs; and management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work, and contractor safety procedures.  In addition, Process Safety Information will be included within this PSM/RMP.  Finally, the seismic assessment conducted on August 23, 1995 will be revalidated by a structural engineer."
