      "SummaryText": "The Lisburne Production Center (LPC) is classified as NAICS code 211111, Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas Production. Prior applicability analysis performed by an earlier operator of LPC demonstrated that the facility was not covered by RMP, due to the a naturally occurring hydrocarbon exemption. While we agree with that analysis, a Program 1 plan for the propane refrigeration process is being submitted.\r\n\r\nDescription of stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nLPC processes crude oil production fluids received from various crude oil accumulations (collectively known as the Greater Pt. McIntyre area or GPMA) located on the North Slope of Alaska, including (but not limited to) Lisburne, Point McIntyre, Niakuk, West Beach State, and North Prudhoe Bay State. Production fluids consist mainly of crude oil, hydrocarbon gas, and water. Crude oil is processed to remove hydrocarbon gas and water in order to meet specific crude oil sales specifications. Sales oil then enters the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Hydrocarbon gas is dehydrated, stripped of butane and heavier hydrocarbons that may be present, and compressed for re-injection into the reservoirs or used as fuel. Water is processed to remove entrained crude oil before injection into disposal or injector wells.\r\n\r\nDry Gas Refrigeration System:\r\nLPC utilizes propane in a dry gas refrigeration system. The propane refrigeration system is a closed circulating loop. Liquid propane is generally prepared on site at LPC and added to the surge drum as needed. The propane system consists of the following equipment and approximate inventories:\r\nThe 42-1242 propane accumulator/surge drum provides liquid propane storage. At normal operating level, the surge drum contains approximately 2,247 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 9,478 lbs. \r\nTwo vessels facilitate compression of propane refrigerant in multiple stages, which improves overall system efficiency: \r\nAt normal operating level, the 42-1343 interstage flash drum contains approximat"

At normal operating level, each chiller contains approximately 4,300 gallons @ 4.2 lbs/gal = 18,138 lbs. \r\n\r\nTotal propane inventory onsite is approximately 54,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nCatastrophic loss of inventory of the 42-1242 Surge Drum is the basis for the Worst Case Scenario calculations as it can have up to 40,620 lbs, based on the high level alarm, during times when the system is down.  The model used was a RMP*Comp. \r\n\r\nNGL/MI Storage and Handling:\r\nDehydrated gas is routed to low-temperature processing where it is chilled using the propane refrigeration process to extract natural gas liquids (NGL) for use as Miscible Injectant (MI). The mixed NGL, comprised primarily of liquid hydrocarbons in the propane (C3) through pentane (C5) range, is a regulated flammable substance.
