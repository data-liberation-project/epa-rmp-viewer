Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help with the following:  (1) contain/control a release; (2) quickly detect a release; and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Sensors with audible alarms are located at the reactor, and storage tank areas.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on storage tanks.\n2. Key manual valves are chained and padlocked in their critical (open/closed) position.\n3. Automated shutdown systems activated by motor failure.\n4. High level and high pressure indicates with alarms.\n5. Derailers and chock blocks to prevent rail car movement for carbon disulfide and methylamine railcars.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus),\n4. Ventilate contaminated areas.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Burley Facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years.  There have been no incidents involving a release of methylamine or carbon disulfide, which had offsite effects.\n\nEmergency Procedure Information\n\nThe Facility maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (TKI)  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nTKI owns and operates a facility located in Burley, Idaho.  The facility produces sodium methyldithiocarbamate (metam sodium) solution, a soil fumigant. \n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TKI identified one listed flammable substance (methylamine) and one toxic regulated substance (carbon disulfide) kept on site above the threshold quantities.  \n\nMethylamine  is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks contain pressure relief valves, but no vents to the atmosphere.  Carbon disulfide is stored in pressurized horizontal steel tanks.  The tanks are located in concrete containment equiped with a water deluge system.  Pressure relief valves protect  the tanks.  In the event of a tank rupture, the carbon disulfide, which is heavier than water, would sink to the bottom of the containment and would be covered with water.  The carbon disulfide could then be recovered back into a tank.\n\nThe Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the Burley Facility contains a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nGroup VP - Accountable for all RMP and PSM compliance of all company facilities.\n\nPSM Coo"

      "SummaryText": "nformation (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.

The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is to be a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees are to receive basic training in process operations and procedures. In addition, all operators are to periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at acceptable level.  This refresher tr"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise (operators).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \n\n1. age of process; \n2. extent of process hazards; \n3. number of affected employees; and \n4. operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.
