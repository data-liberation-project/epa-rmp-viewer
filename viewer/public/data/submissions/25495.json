      "SummaryText": "     An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) describes policies and procedures necessary to minimize hazards to human safety and healthand to the environment from fires, explosions, releases of chemicals, severe weather or other accidents.  A written plan is necessary to keep track of all emergency procedures and provisions.  It is also easier to ensure training is completed and is consistent for all employees when an Emergency Action Plan is in writing.  An Emergency Action Plan must contain emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; description of rescue  and medical duties for those employees who are to preform them; the perfered means of reporting fires and other emergencies; names or regular job titles of person or departments who can be contacted for further information  or explanation of duties under the plan.  The written plan also includes all the MSDS sheets for the products we carry.  The purpose of this business is to buy and sell grain, and to retail other farm related supplies and services, including bulk fuels and anhydrous ammonia.  This is the plan for the FARMERS COOPERATIVE ELEVATOR COMPANY, Everly, Iowa.  68.185\n     Our work is year round.  Normal operations, (January through December) are Monday through Saturday noon.

This would include  contractors, grain inspectors, state inspectors and others doing work at the facility.  The visitors log would help the EC in locating these personnel in the event of an emergency.  In the event of an emergency the EC would be able to assemble his employees to the rendezvous point which is north of the scale, which is between the office and the feedmill.  At this time a head count could be taken; this would help the EC in locating personel still missing and also locating personel signed in the visitors log if any.  At this time the EC would be able to secure the area and asign duties; making sure curious onlookers, the press, and unauthorized employees do not enter the dangerous area.  The EC would coordinate outside response, assembling the appropriate personel to take care of the situation.  Once the situation is under control, it is imparative that the same accident does not happen again.  Steps must be taken to correct the problem.  Any emergency equipment used, should be replaced, or cleaned and repaired and returned to its proper position.  If replacement is not practical make other arangements before resuming operations, and advise all personel of the change.  APP. A.\n     In a worst case scenario, the release of 79,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a 10 minute time period would release 7,900 pounds per minute.  A wind speed of 1.5 m/sec would be able to move this material to a 1.80 mile radius.  Offsite receptors include livestock and other animals; crops and green vegitation; businesses and schools; and a population of 700 people.  "

Gloves and goggles must be worn when handling anhydrous ammonia.  Never wear contact\n          lenses when working around anhydrous ammonia.  \n          C.  Detach the nurse tank from towing vehicle and chock the wheels.  Always work upwind when \n           handling or transfering anhydrous ammonia.  \n     2.

Once liquid BEGINS coming through the 85% FIXED liquid level gauge, the tank is at its maximum\n          RECOMMENDED filling level.  Shut pump off.  Close liquid and vapor valves starting at the riser first.\n          Close valves on the hose ends, and then close the valves on the tank itself.

The seriousness depends on the amount released and the number of persons, animals or crops in the danger zone.  Most common accidents happen for the following reasons.\n     1.  Broken riser pipes caused by driving off without disconnecting hoses.\n     2.  Ruptured hoses caused by using faulty or damaged hoses.\n     3.  Ruptured hoses caused by hydrostatic valves not operating properly.\n     4.  Defective valves or inoperative excess flow valves.  \n     5.  Collision or upset truck or nurse tank.

Exposure to high gas concentrations may lead to temporary blindness and severe tissue damage.  Contact with liquid can produce severe frostbite or freezing, chemical burns and blindness.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with eye disease.\nSKIN:  LIquid solutions and high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can cause blistering or first - and second degree burns.  Rapid evaporation of the liquid and chemical reaction with the skins moisture will cause freezing of the tissue followed by caistic burn.  Severe injuries can be fatal.\nINHALATION:  The odor of ammonia, which can be detected at 1 - 50 ppm, serve as an excellent warning. Accidental exposure to high concentrations (i.e., 400 ppm and above) can cause severe irritation of the respiratory system such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Breathing concentrations of 5,000 ppm has been reported to cause lung inflamation and death by asphyxiation.  Continued exposure to lower concentrations of of the gas cause irritation to mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract and possible damage to the lungs.  Exposure to ammonia may exacerabate symptoms in persons with impared kidney, liver, or pulmonary function.\nINGESTATION:  Can produce corrosion and inflamation of the esophagus, gastritis, abdomin"
