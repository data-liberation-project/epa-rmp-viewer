The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids, Iowa at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified facility employs 186 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\r\n\r\nThe facility manufactures enzymes, fermentates, and whole cells for food, animal feed, and industrial use through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility's enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has maintenance and laboratory support.  Support staff includes site management, safety, health and environmental (SHE), engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\r\n\r\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Maximum on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 130,000 liters.  The ammonium hydroxide Risk Management Program (RMP) covers ammonium hydroxide unloading operations, storage, transfer, and fermentation operations.\r\n\r\nChemical Safety\r\n\r\nThe site's overall approach to chemical safety is comprehensive.  Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including automation, containment of all outdoor ta"

This was led by the site Process Safety Management (PSM) Leader, who is trained internally by DuPont to lead PHAs.  The PHA included a team of DuPont IB, Cedar Rapids members representing Logistics (process), Fermentation (process), Maintenance, Engineering, and SHE.  Five recommendations for investigation and improvement were generated from the Process Hazard Analysis.

All ERT members are trained in the site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release on an annual basis.  The site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release is shared with the Cedar Rapids Fire Department and Linn County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nGeneral Prevention Measures\r\n\r\nDanisco, Cedar Rapids has a number of measures in place for spill prevention.  These include, but are not limited to an in-depth preventative maintenance program tracked using SAP, standard operating procedures which are updated at least annually, employee training, back-up equipment where possible, computer monitored level indicators with interlocking systems when process limits are reached, and containment basins.  The facility has 24-hour team-based operations coverage in the facility.  The facility also operates under ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications which ensure that proper document control is in place.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an Emergency Response Team on all shifts ensures that all safety and environmental events are addressed immediately to prevent the escalation of an incident if possible.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe DuPont, Cedar Rapids Facility has had one incident in the last 5-years involving the ammonia hydroxide system that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\r\n\u00bf\t3/18/2015 there was a release on-site that led to the release of 55 lb. of ammonia.
