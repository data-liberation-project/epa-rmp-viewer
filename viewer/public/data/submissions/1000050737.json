This will be done in coordination with on-site and local emergency responders and is incorporated into the Local Emergency Planning Committee's (LEPC) Emergency Response Plan.  Furthermore, ERDC leadership has committed to supporting CRREL's membership on the Hanover/Lebanon LEPC by providing the financial resources, time and training to obtain and maintain a response capability.\n\n\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe Laboratory is located approximately two miles north of the town's center of Hanover, NH.  CRREL solves interdisciplinary and strategically important problems of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, Department of Defense and the Nation by advancing and applying science and engineering to complex environments, materials, and processes in all seasons and climates, with unique core competencies related to the Earth's cold regions. The 30 acre site is bordered on the north by undeveloped land (previously a housing complex, but now demolished) to the  south by small housing areas, to the west by a narrow buffer of undeveloped land and the Connecticut River and on the east by a state highway and public school facility.  Within a half mile radius, there are additional housing complexes, office buildings, the Hanover Fire, Police and Emergency Medical Response complex, a nursing home, a senior living community, and a few small businesses.\n\n\n\nCRREL's refrigeration system in the Ice Engineering Facility (IEF) uses anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.

No other EHS's above the TPQ exist at CRREL. \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios were reviewed and analyzed during the Hazard Assessment conducted by Industrial Consultants on behalf of CRREL during April 2015. \n\n\n\n? The worst case release scenario was determined by the release of 5,700 lbs. of ammonia from the largest single vessel, High Pressure Receiver (HPR), over a 10 minute period. The capacity of this vessel is limited to 80% of its volume by engineering and administrative (SOP's) controls. Since the maximum ammonia inventory of 20,000 lbs cannot be stored within the HPR, a release of the capacity of the HPR will be the facility's worst case. The machine room where the HPR is located is considered a passive mitigation system. The distance to toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.7 miles using the RMP*Comp program. \n\n? Various alternative release scenarios were analyzed but only one had the potential for creating an off-site endpoint. This scenario involves the over pressurization and venting through relief valves. The maximum release time to the outside air was determined to be 1 hour. The release time was limited to 1 hour because there are ammonia detectors located within the relief line, onsite ammonia plant operators who regularly perform monitoring rounds, and an emergency response team is available if needed. During the 1 hour period, the pressure relief valve will only be open intermittently. It is estimated that the fraction of time the valve is open will be 25%. The distance to toxic endpoint was calculated to be 0.1 miles using the RMP*Comp program.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention systems.\n\n\n\nCRREL incorporated the elements of EPA's Risk Management Program into the act"

The committee is in the process of updating all of the SOP's for the ammonia plant and its operation. A new machine room ventilation system is being installed during the summer/fall of 2015. To further enhance CRREL's ability to prevent accidental releases, we have increased the capacity of our ammonia alarm system, upgraded the automated operating system (SCADA), maintained our on-site emergency response team and eliminated our legacy emergency dump station.\n\n\n\nThe five year accident history\n\n\n\nCRREL has not had a reportable release in the last five years.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nCRREL has been a member of the EPCRA Hanover/Lebanon Local Emergency Planning Committee since its inception. Early in the process, it was recognized that there were no local resources available to respond to a major ammonia release from CRREL, other than for isolation and evacuation.  At the time, CRREL made a commitment to develop an in-house response team. All necessary equipment and HAZWOPER training was obtained.  A key element of the response program was that the Hanover Fire Department (HFD) would retain incident command for any release.  HFD is about 0.25 miles from CRREL, so a close working relationship has been developed in such areas as compatibility of radios and air tanks, providing and calibration of ammonia detectors, and frequent familiarization with CRREL personnel and facilities.
