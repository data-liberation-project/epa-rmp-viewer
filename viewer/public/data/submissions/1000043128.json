If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility Information:\r\n\r\nA\u00b7\tThe primary activity at the facility is the production of ammonia thiosulfate solution the sale of fertilizer to farmers for crop production.\r\nA\u00b7\t Anhydrous ammonia is used in the production of this product. \t\r\n.        The maximum quantity stored would be 315,180 pounds in our two 30,000 gallon storage tank and our one- 12,000 gallon storage tank.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 315,180 pounds is rounded to 320,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe accidental release prevention program:\r\n\r\nThe facility has referred to the provisions of A\u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Kk-611.1A\u00bf, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, A\u00bfStorage and handling of Anhydrous AmmoniaA\u00bf.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\r\n\r\na.\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,325 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  Due to the rounding requirements of the RMP Submit Program the 131,325 pounds is rounded to 130,000 pounds.
