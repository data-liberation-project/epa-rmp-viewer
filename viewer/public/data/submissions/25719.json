      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for RMP Submittal\n\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated procedures at the Xcel Energy Black Dog Generating Plant.\n\nPrevention and Response Procedures\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response procedures are represented in the Emergency Planning and Response Section of the Black Dog Generating Plant RMP manual for the ammonia system.  Black Dog Generating Plant takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of chemicals.  Black Dog Generating Plant has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  The emergency procedures are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nBlack Dog Generating Plant is an electric generating plant that utilizes coal-fired and natural gas-fired combined cycle generating technology.  As part of the combined-cycle technology, the facility will be using 29% aqueous ammonia solution, which is regulated under the RMP rule and qualifies for Program 2 requirements.  The ammonia will be used for flue gas treatment and will be stored in a 20,000 gallon storage tank with a possible maximum inventory of 151,242 pounds.\n\nRelease Scenarios\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  The RMP rule specifies that the worst-case release scenario involves the release of the single largest container of a regulated substance (20,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia) over a ten minute period.  No active mitigation may be considered for the worst-case scenario.  In addition, worst-case meteorological conditions are assumed to be present.  The RMP*Comp air dispersion model was used to determin"

This worst-case radius of influence of 0.9 miles is used in the RMP plan.\n\nThe alternative release scenario consists of a release of 500 gallons (3,781 pounds) of aqueous ammonia over a five minute period due to a hose failure at product delivery.  Release into the diked area was considered to influence the release scenario.  A distance of 0.1 miles to the toxic endpoint was determined.\n\nPrevention Steps for Aqueous Ammonia\nThe prevention program is described in the Black Dog Generating Plant RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n*Safety Information has been collected and summarized in the RMP manual.\n*Hazard Review \u00bf The initial Hazard Review for the ammonia system was conducted in February 2002.  The recommendations from the Hazard Review will be addressed prior to initial delivery of ammonia to the facility.\n*Operating procedures for the ammonia system are available in the RMP manual.\n*Training for personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.\n*Maintenance program through the plant computerized work order/preventative maintenance system to ensure that the ammonia system equipment is maintained in good and safe working condition.\n*Incident investigation procedures for the investigation of any catastrophic (or potentially catastrophic) incident associated with the ammonia system, using the company Event Assessment form.\n*Compliance audits to be conducted at least once every three years to ensure continued compliance of the facility\u00bfs ammonia system RMP program.  Since the ammonia system is being installed in 2002, an audit will be required in 2005.\n\nAccident History\nThe RMP rule (40 CFR 68.42) requires the accident history for the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP.  Since the ammonia system is new (installation 2002), there is no accident histo"

The program is described in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the RMP manual and meets the requirement of the RMP rule.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases to the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect changes.  Emergency response training for facility employees  is conducted annually.  The next emergency response training session is scheduled for June 4, 2002.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings are held regularly at the facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate or minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of the Black Dog Generating Plant RMP manual, a Hazard Review was conducted.  During the Hazard Review, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations were implemented, all were considered and discussed.  The exercise provided heightened awareness of safety issues related to the ammonia system."
