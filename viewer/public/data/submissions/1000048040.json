Our goal is zero incidents ... always. We strive to achieve incident free operations and ensure that everyone - contractor and Chevron employee alike - returns home safely each day. Operational Excellence (OE) is utilized as a systematic management of safety, health, environment, reliability and efficiency to achieve world-class performance and includes the following three components. \n\n1.    Leadership accountability \n\n2.    Management system process\n\n3.    OE expectations\n\nThe Refinery Operational Excellence Vision and Objectives includes the following guidelines for all employees;\n\n\n\n? Operate in a safe and environmentally sound manner. \n\n? Utilize safe work practices and maintain a healthy workplace. \n\n? Identify and mitigate environmental and process safety risks. \n\n? Operate with world-class reliability. \n\n?

Two guiding principles at this Refinery are; \"Do it safely or not at all\" and \"There is always time to do it right.\"\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Pascagoula Refinery is located in Pascagoula, MS.  The Refinery receives crude oil by tanker and pipeline for processing into various products.  The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products such as gasoline and propane is known"

Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances. Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, 2-pentene (E) 2-pentene(Z) and isopentane. \n\n\n\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Nitrogen compounds contained in crude feeds are converted to anhydrous ammonia in the crude refining process and the anhydrous ammonia is then recovered and sold as a product. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThis section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP (Risk Management Process) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analyses. Every organizational meeting is started with a short safety/health discussion.  Safety topic pres"

A culture is established where employees feel comfortable engaging with Management to address safety concerns or improvements to a process.   \n\n\n\nLPS\n\nThe Loss Prevention System (LPS) is a proven behavior-based system designed to help prevent and resolve unplanned losses - whether safety or business-related - across the Refinery. Consistent usage of LPS tools and techniques strengthens our culture of injury and incident free operations. LPS offers a new approach to reducing and eliminating costly losses and incidents by focusing on behavior-based tools and management techniques. By using LPS, employees and contractors are able to identify the risks or potential causes of an injury or incident before it occurs and then implement the proper changes or improvements so that the task can be performed safely and efficiently. The reporting process for loss investigations, near loss investigations and observations is done through a database.\n\nSafety Audits\n\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate OE Safety, Fire, Health, and Reliability Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations. Internal audits are performed on a regular frequency involving management and first line supervision with specific emphasis on high risk safe work practices such as confined space, hot work, work at heights, electrical and isolation of hazardous energy. \n\n\n\nWe were audited by OSHA under the Federal PSM National Enforcement Program in January 2009. There were no Serious, Willful or Repeat PSM citations resulting from the comprehensive audit.  The team consisted of 10 OSHA employees on site for eight weeks. They reque"

OSHA told our management that our facility was far ahead of other facilities that they had inspected and they were very complementary on the safety culture and philosophy of our employees and contractors. \n\n\n\nWe were also audited by the EPA in September 2014.  The team consisted of 10 OSHA employees on site for four days. The EPA requested approximately five hundred documents for review and conducted many employee interviews.  At the time of this writing, we have not received the results from the EPA concerning this audit. \n\n\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nSafety meetings are held on a routine basis throughout the Refinery and involve all employees as participants and/or presenters. All meetings start with a formal or informal safety minute. We also utilize Safety meetings as needed to communicate or empha specific information. Management conducts monthly Loss Prevention stewardship meetings with employees to review the previous month's activities and lessons learned as a check on the health of the process. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nProcess Safety Information is reviewed prior to the start of a Process Hazard Analysis study of a plant. Process Safety Information is updated using the Management of Change (MOC) process.  Process Safety Information includes but is not limited to safety instruction sheets, operating procedures, piping and instrumentation drawings, loop drawings and material safety data sheets.  Most of this information is available electronically for easy access.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWe maintain operating manuals for each unit that are designed to serve as the single reference source for the unit.

These procedures are posted electronically and are periodically reviewed and revised. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is the Hazard and Operability Study.  A PHA study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.\n\n\n\nThe employer must use one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n\n-What if\n\n-What If/Checklist\n\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n\n-Fault tree analysis or\n\n-An appropriate equivalent methodology.\n\n\n\nA PHA is conducted by a team of people with expertise in engineering and process operations.

Training programs, which are developed locally and through Chevron corporate organizations, include formal on-boarding, job-specific training, compliance training, professional skills training, and leadership development.  Learning & Development maintains detailed records of all completed training through the Chevron Learning Management System and locally managed training records.\n\n\n\nOf note are the comprehensive operations and mechanic training programs that are provided to the O&M workforce.  These programs encompass multi-year progression paths over which time the new hire trainee ultimately achieves fully qualified status as an operator or mechanic.  These programs employ a building-block approach to learning in order to ensure the Refinery is provided with a well qualified workforce.  In this culture, the individuals' learning does not end with the successful conclusion of the fully-qualified program but continues throughout their career with ongoing skill enhancement training and periodic refresher training. Specific program objectives include:\n\n\n\n?    Providing a well qualified workforce to the business units and craft teams of the Refinery.\n\n?

Contractors are managed through a Global standardized process referred to as Contractor Health Environment and Safety Management (CHESM).  CHESM is a process designed to:\n\n?    Reduce the risk of contractor incidents, accidents, injuries and occupational illnesses\n\n?    Reduce the risk of environmental liabilities incurred through contractor (third-party) activities \n\n?    Reduce the risk of financial liabilities incurred through contractor (third-party) activities\n\nThe CHESM process focuses on improving Contractor performance through leadership accountability, planning, HES engagement and HES processes such as qualification and selection, pre-job and work in progress reviews.  \n\nContractors are hired based on their past safety performance, safety attitude, present programs and practices, and most importantly their projected capability to achieve an acceptable safety performance and compliance with applicable environmental and safety regulations.  \n\n\n\nAll contractors are required to attend a Contractor Safety Orientation Program [Incident and Injury Free training (IIF)] before being allowed to work within the Refinery.  Training consists of the Refinery safety policy and rules, the emergency response plan, the drug and alcohol policy, process hazards and alarms and an overview of environmental requirements.  All Contractors receive a modified introduction to LPS during IIF training which focuses on the basic tools and prem"

In this meeting, the importance of an IIF culture is discussed and contractors are asked for their safety viewpoints. We also discuss the three elements of a good shutdown: safety, quality, and schedule. Emphasis is placed on Safety first and schedule last. At times Contractors may also present their own safety presentations at this meeting. \n\n\n\nThe Refinery also has a Contractor Safety Team which consists of various contractors partnering with each other and Chevron to develop an incident and injury free culture through performing weekly field audits/observations and promoting new safety initiatives and programs.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that a pre-startup safety review must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to insure that prior to startup, refinery equipment is reviewed to determine whether it is safe to operate, and meets all applicable requirements of Company standards, good engineering practices, industry codes and practices, and local, State, and Federal codes and statutes.  The  PSSR  consists of several independent reviews which include a Design, Construction and Standard Review, Safety in Design Review, Plant Protection Review, an Environmental review, an Operational Readiness Review, and a Process Hazard Analysis (for new construction). \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity  \n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, constructio"

Training is routinely conducted on these practices and procedures are periodically reviewed and updated.  The Refinery also has a Rotating Equipment Reliability (RER) team that is responsible for identifying machinery-related problems and promoting solutions concerning critical machinery.  Members of the RER department are consulted whenever buying new machinery or when a machine design change is being considered.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity programs are outlined in the Owner-User Manual and RI-503 and are audited by the State Jurisdiction on a three year frequency.\n\n \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has safe work practices in place to identify, assess and eliminate or mitigate risks associated with high risk work to ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include but are not limited to: \n\n1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous     work areas, \n\n2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of hazardous energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n\n3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, \n\n4) a permit procedure to control activities that may be a source of ignition (i.e. hot work), and \n\n5) the controlled entry of personnel into plant areas.  \n\n\n\nThe Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel involved with these types of work form a system that aids in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nThe purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipa"

Management of Change applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \n\n\n\nThe MOC process involves a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, and electrical classification as applicable, as well as a review of all associated documents and manuals for proper update of the change.  The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an \"authorization to implement change\" approval.  A copy of the signed MOC documentation form accompanies all copies of the work request for Operator and Mechanic review.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.  Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that an incident investigation must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release or fire in the workplace. Since we are committed to preventing incidents and thereby protecting employees and our surrounding community we actually investigate more incidents than are required under the OSHA PSM law. We do this in an effort to understand and stop smaller problems from becoming larger problems which might lead to an incident. \n\n\n\nAll major incidents are investigated using an industry accepted process such as TapRooT&reg; or Why Tree.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years with an audit team comprised of management and operations personnel.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are kept on file in the Process Safety Management Team Lead office.\n\n \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nRefinery processes have hazards associated with them that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Details for this November 2013 fire are in Section 6 as required. This fire is an RMP incident due to the onsite fatality, and fire damage to the physical plant equipment.  However there were no offsite impacts that would make this plant ineligible to remain a Process 1 Plant. Progress towards completion of corrective actions from this investigation are tracked in the Refinery's incident database and reviewed monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n \n\nThe Refinery maintains a written emergency response plan that describes procedures to protect worker safety and the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response, including the incident command system (which is the organizational structure used during emergency response), fire fighting equipment and procedures, internal and external assistance and equipment resources, first aid and medical attention procedures, evacuation plans, and notification procedures for government agencies and community officials in the event of an offsite or reportable release. There are also procedures in place for the testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and procedures for equipment operation.  \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Team (ERT) is highly trained and skilled.

These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating \"what if\" situations which stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill different operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motion of putting out the fire.  Other personnel in the Refinery may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills are scheduled at least biannually and are on a larger scale. These drills include an outside Ambulance Service and participants treat this hypothetical drill situation as if it is a real fire and respond. Public Officials from the Local Fire Department, Navy base and Singing River Hospital have been invited to participate or critique the drills.\n\n\n\nThe Refinery's fire-fighting equipment is highly capable. Our inventory is supported by a 100 ft aerial platform (3000 gpm) truck, one 2000 gpm foam pumper truck , one 3500 gpm foam pumper truck, hazmat trailer, High Angle rescue truck, and a Medical Transport Vehicle.
