The process safety portion of the manual provides facility personnel guidance on implementing the program for ensuring regulatory compliance and protection of employees from chemical releases.  The risk management elements of the manual are intended to prevent accidental releases that could cause harm to the public or environment, and to mitigate the severity of these releases should they occur.  The single USEPA/CalARP covered process present at the facility and specifically addressed in this manual, is the receipt, storage, and conveyance of aqueous ammonia used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit.\n1.1\tPURPOSE\nCalpine is dedicated to protecting employees, the community, and the environment from highly hazardous incidents through safely operating our facility.  To ensure efficient and effective management of our operations, we have developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP) manual.  The manual provides the facility with a systematic and integrated approach to evaluating, implementing, and continuously improving RMP.  The manual addresses how the various ongoing activities (i.e., process design and maintenance, training, operating procedures, emergency response planning) that impact the ammonia system are implemented.  This approach also ensures the participation of management and staff.\n1.2\tMANUAL USE"

This plant is located at 606 De La Fuente Court, San Diego, California 92154. The facility utilizes combined-cycle combustion turbine technology in the electrical generation process. The plant consists of (2) natural gas fired turbines and associated duct burners, a single steam turbine, and associated support equipment.\nThe Otay Mesa Energy Center LLC is comparable to the majority of Calpine's energy centers; the OMEC is a combined-cycle design that enables it to generate electricity up to 40 percent more efficiently than traditional natural gas-fueled facilities. The plant also incorporates best available emissions control technology. The turbines are equipped with dry low nitrogen (NOx) combustors and a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Unit for the control of emissions of oxides of NOx. The SCR system uses aqueo"

As such, the facility has the required systems to store and distribute aqueous ammonia for the SCR process.\nThe facility stores aqueous ammonia on site in a stationary non-pressurized storage tank with a capacity of approximately 16,000 gallons. Aqueous ammonia solution of 29.5 percent (or less) by weight ammonia is being used. Administrative controls limit the actual tank storage capacity to 85 percent of maximum design capacity, i.e., 13,600 gallons. The EPA threshold for Ammonia is concentrations greater than 20% and 20,000 lbs (CalARP threshold is identical to the EPA threshold).\nThe tank is situated within a secondary containment area of sufficient size and volume to contain the entire contents of the tank plus the rainfall from the worst-case storm scenario. The ammonia storage and handling facilities is equipped with continuous tank level monitors, temperature and pressure monitors and alarms. In addition to the main SCR system ammonia storage, the facility also uses aqueous ammonia in small totes. These totes have a capacity of less than 400 gallons each and store aqueous ammonia in solutions less than 20% ammonia by weight.\n1.5\tBASIS FOR PROGRAM 2 DESIGNATION\nThe purpose of Facility offsite consequence analysis (OCA) component of the EPA Risk Management Program and California Accidental Release Prevention (Cal-ARP) Program for its electric generating station referred to as the Otay Mesa Energy Center (OMEC), is to inform the public regarding the worst-case and alternate case off-site consequences of an accidental release of a Federal RMP and/or Cal-ARP regulated substance. The primary objective of the OCA is to determine the maximum distance from a potential Worst-case release location to a \"toxic endpoint\".  The OCA also provides the possible impact of a more likely release scenario, referred to as the Alternate Release Scenario (ARS).  The toxic endpoint specified by the federal and Cal-ARP regulations for Ammonia is 0"

For Program 2 processes, facilities must evaluate and document one worst case release scenario representing all regulated flammable and toxic substances in covered processes and additional worst case release scenarios if different public receptors are affected by a release from another onsite covered process.  Also, one alternative release scenario is required for substances in covered processes. The Risk Management Program (RMP) rule defines key terms and outlines the steps to conducting an off-site consequence analysis, the specific parameters that must be used and the requirements for reviewing, updating and documenting off-site consequence results.  The OCA must be updated at least once every five (5) years.  The Plant Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating all OCA information. EHS Specialist will work with Calpine EHS Manager to schedule and complete the OCA.\n3.2\tAMMONIA OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for 29.5 % aqueous ammonia was conducted to fulfil the Offsite Consequence Analysis requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Article 4, Sections 2750.1 to 2750.9 (19 CCR \u00a72750.1 - 2750.9) and the US EPA\u0092s Risk Management plan Section 68.165 for Otay Mesa Energy Center.  The OCA estimated the potential for an accidental release to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a \u0093worst case release scenario\u0094 and an \u0093alternative release scenario\u0094. It is highly unlikely that a worst-case scenario will ever occur, however, RMP rules requires that an evaluation of the impacts from an instantaneous release of the largest quantity of a toxic or flammable substance stored on site.

A public receptor includes offsite residences, institutions, industrial, commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time.  A road is not considered a public receptor.\n3.3\tWORST-CASE ANALYSIS\nThe worst-case release scenario requires that a release of the entire contents of the single largest vessel or pipe be evaluated for offsite impacts.  Only passive or administrative controls were considered under the worst-case release scenario.  The worst-case release scenario for Otay Mesa Energy Center is the rupture of one ammonia bulk storage tank, resulting in a release of 16,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia solution into the secondary containment area and the subsequent evaporation over a 10-minute duration.\nThe worst-case release scenario used Marplot 5.1.1 mapping software, a geographic information system developed by the Office of Emergency Management of the EPA and the Emergency Response Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to determine the potential impact to the residential population surrounding PEC.  This program applies 2010 U.S. Census data to identify the total number of residents within the impact areas.  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  All required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity,"

The secondary containment was used as a passive mitigation.  \nResults of the worst-case ammonia release scenario indicated that an aqueous ammonia concentration of 200 ppm (toxic endpoint) could extend up to a distance of 0.30 miles (528 yards) from the ammonia release point.  Using 2010 US Census Bureau data with Marplot 5.1.1 mapping software, the Worst-Case Scenario release from SCR aqueous ammonia tank does not impact any residents. Other public or sensitive receptors were identified within the worst-case toxic endpoint circle for ammonia. The potential sensitive receptors include Correctional/Detention Centers and businesses.\n3.4\tALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS\nRMP and CalARP regulations require that a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario is selected as the alternative release.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \u0093active\u0094 mitigation, such as automatic shutoff valves.  Active mitigation consists of mechanical, electrical, or human input. CalARP also requires that the selected alternative release scenario be calculated such that it will reach a toxic endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.  The County of San Diego, Department of Environmental Health and Quality, Hazardous Materials Division (CSDDEHQ) requires that the worst credible release modelled with conservative meteorological conditions be used for the alternative release scenario.\nThe alternate release scenario chosen for OMEC was failure of a seal on one of the ammonia forwarding pumps during operation.  It was conservatively assumed that the leak from the pump would completely cover the storage tank containment area.  The containment area has ammonia monitors so a leak from ammonia equipment would be quickly detected.   \nThe results of the dispersion modelling a"

An estimate of the possible release quantity during an accident, a determination of downwind effects, and a definition of the potential exposure to affected public and environmental receptors are required.  These items constitute an Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The offsite consequence analysis for Otay Mesa Energy Center was prepared in compliance with Subpart B of 40 CFR 68 and CalARP Program Sections 2750.1 through 2750.9.\nA.1\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Applicability (\u00a7 68.20 and Section 2750.1)\nOtay Mesa Energy Center stores and handles approximately 16,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 29.4 percent.  This exceeds the CalARP threshold of 500 pounds and federal RMP thresholds of 20,000 pounds for concentrations greater than 20 percent.  Therefore, this process is subject to CalARP and federal RMP regulations. Aqueous ammonia is used for selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the exhaust of Heat Recovery Steam Generators and Auxiliary Boiler at the Otay Mesa Energy Center.   Because it is not part of the NAICS codes listed by USEPA in 68.10(d), not subject to Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (because its concentration is less than 44 percent), and there are public receptors (residences) in the toxic endpoint zone for the worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia, the aqueous ammonia process falls into CalARP Program 2.\nA.2\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Parameters (\u00a7 68.22 and Section 2750.2)\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for aqueous ammonia was conducted using the CalARP Regulations Title 19 CCR 27.3(c). The CalARP regulations define the worst-case release scenario for toxic gas releases as follows (1) For regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that"

The release rate shall be assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.\nTo develop the worst-case scenario, the largest storage vessel was selected. As stated in 19 CCR \u00a72750.3, the worst-case release quantity is the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity. The process of worst case scenario identification included reviewing the inventory calculations of the vessels, selecting the largest vessel with the regulated substance, using modeling software to determine the dispersion endpoints for the worst case scenario and determining the vulnerability zones.\nOne worst-case release scenario was developed for the facility. \nThe worst-case release scenario used Marplot 5.1.1 mapping software, a geographic information system developed by the Office of Emergency Management of the EPA and the Emergency Response Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to determine the potential impact to the residential population surrounding PEC.  This program applies 2010 U.S. Census data to identify the total number of residents within the impact areas.  When calculating population densities for large areas which encompass many tracts, the accuracy is rated as good; however, for small areas that encompass only two or three partial tracts, the population data may be skewed due to the unequal distribution within the tract.\nThe alternative release scenario chosen for OMEC was failure of a seal on one of the ammonia forwarding pumps during operation.  It was conservatively assumed that the leak from the pump would completely cover the storage tank containment area.  The containment area has ammonia monitors so a leak from ammonia equipment would be quickly detected.\nUsing the same methodology as above, the ARS release rate would be the same value as for the worst-case"

The parameters used for the offsite consequence analysis are listed below.\nA.2.1 Toxic Endpoint\nThe distance from the point of release to a location at which the toxic regulated substance concentration equals or exceeds a certain concentration must be determined.  That concentration is known as the toxic endpoint. The toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L, or 200 parts per million by volume as defined in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A.  It also represents the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG)-2, which is defined as \u0093the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u0092s ability to take protective action.\u0094\nBecause the cloud from an ammonia leak would disperse relatively quickly, an individual at a toxic endpoint distance would be exposed to an ammonia concentration of 200 ppm for much less than the one hour assumed by the ERPG-2.  In addition, the ERPG-2 levels result in relatively minor health effects.  Therefore, an individual at the toxic endpoint distance would be affected less than the results of the worst-case scenario may imply.\nAmmonia Characteristics\nAqueous ammonia (NH4OH), also known as ammonium hydroxide, is a colorless liquid at standard temperature and pressure, and has a strong pungent odor.  Aqueous ammonia readily releases ammonia by vaporization.  Consequently, some of the safety information listed below is for ammonia.

It may even cause burns and permanent damage to these areas.  It is corrosive to skin, causing burns and blisters.  Eye symptoms include glaucoma, corneal ulceration, and blindness.  Breathing can irritate the mouth, nose, and throat.  Increased levels may irritate the lungs, causing coughing, wheezing and/or shortness of breath.\nSystemic\u0097Repeated exposure to low concentrations of aqueous ammonia through inhalation may cause bronchitis to develop with cough, phlegm, and shortness of breath.  Repeated skin contact can cause dryness, itching and redness (dermatitis). \nChronic\u0097It is unknown whether ammonia causes cancer or adversely affects reproduction.\nA.2.2\tWind Speed and Atmospheric Stability Class\nEPA and CalARP regulations require the use of a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s) and an atmospheric stability class F for performing an offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario.  Stability classes are categorized by the amount of turbulence in the atmosphere and are typically divided into six classes (A to F), with F being the least turbulent and A the most.  A typical class A stability occurs on a sunny day with a high wind speed, D on a cloudy day with an active wind speed, and F in the evening with a low wind speed.  With increased turbulence, a plume is diluted more rapidly and the distance to the toxic endpoint will be shorter.  Therefore, EPA chose stability class F and a wind speed of 1.5 m/s (approximately 3.4 mph) for the worst-case scenario to represent the conditions that result in the least amount of regulated substance dilution and farthest distance to the toxic endpoint. For the alternative release scenario, EPA and CalARP regulations suggest the use of typical meteorological conditions or, if these are not available, a wind speed of 3 m/s and an atmospheric stability class D may be used"

Since sufficient site-specific temperature data are not available, the worst-case temperature used was 25?C (77?F), using EPA Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, for toxic endpoint calculation of the worst-case release scenario. \nFor humidity, the dispersion calculation for the offsite consequence analysis followed EPA\u0092s OCA Guidance and Treatment Plant Guidance, which assumes 50 percent humidity for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.\nA.2.4 Height of Release\nRMP and CalARP regulations require that, for the worst-case release analysis, the release should be assumed to occur at ground level (0 feet).  The dispersion calculations used for the worst-case release scenario at OMEC assumes the release occurs at ground level.\nIn performing the offsite consequence analysis for the alternative scenario, the height of release may be determined from the release scenario conditions.

Since the area surrounding Otay Mesa Energy Center is heavily industrialized and includes shipping businesses, power plants and a detention center, the facility location was characterized as an urban area with a surface roughness of 1.0 meter for the toxic endpoint calculation. \nA.2.6 Dense or Neutrally Buoyant Gases\nEPA and CalARP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis appropriately account for the density of the released gas. Dispersion equations in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants account for the fact that ammonia is a neutrally buoyant gas.\nA.2.7 Temperature of Released Substance\nThe temperature of the released gas was 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for the worst case and for the alternative release scenario.\nA.3 Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis (\u00a7 68.25 and Section 2750.3)\nRMP and CalARP regulations require that a worst-case release scenario analysis be performed in compliance with specified conditions, as detailed below.\nA.3.1 Number of Release Scenarios\nRMP and CalARP regulations require an offsite consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  The worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia was a spill of 16,000 gallons of ammonia to the secondary containment area and the subsequent evaporation of the ammonia.\nA.3.2 Worst-Case Release Quantity\nThe worst-case release scenario assum"

Only \u0093passive\u0094 mitigation methods such as buildings or dikes can be considered.  Passive mitigation consists of no mechanical, electrical, or human input.  The regulations require that the worst-case scenario assume atmospheric conditions that are conservative and result in large impact areas. For ammonia, the release quantity was assumed to be the release of the full tank of ammonia, 16,000 gallons, into the containment area, a passive mitigation system.  The containment area can hold more than the entire contents of the ammonia tank. \nA.3.3 Worst-Case Release Scenario for Toxic Gases\nAccording to RMP and CalARP regulations, the surface area of the contained liquid shall be used to calculate the volatilization rate for toxic substances that are normally liquids at ambient temperature. The release rate to air for toxic liquids is assumed to be the rate of evaporation from the pool formed by the released liquid.\nThe log-log equation used to calculate the distance to the Toxic Endpoint for the aqueous ammonia WCS was developed based on the best straight line fits to the log-log graph of release rate versus distance. The equation can be found in Appendix F of the General Guidance for Risk Management Programs, Supplemental Risk Management Guidance for Water Treatment Plants.  This distance is for a 10-minute release of aqueous ammonia from pool formed in the tank containment with an atmospheric stability class of \u0093F\u0094, with rural topography, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and passive mitigation consisting of a diked spill area taken into account. Because wind direction does not impact the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint in this study, the resulting plume is round.  ?\nTable A-1 below lists the data used for each of the worst-case analyses.\n\nTABLE A 1: OCA ANALYSIS DATA SUMMARY\nParameter\tWorst Case Tank\tAlternate Case Tank\nTank\nRelease Rate,"

The toxic endpoint distance for aqueous ammonia was calculated using the total containment area of 701 ft2 (surface area of the spill within the storage tank containment). It should be noted, however, that this scenario does not replicate actual atmospheric, geographic, and risk management conditions at Otay Mesa Energy Center, all of which would serve to decrease the range of the potential endpoint.\nA.4 Alternative Release Scenario Analysis (\u00a7 68.28 and Section 2750.4)\nA.4.1 Number of Scenarios\nRMP and CalARP regulations require that in addition to the worst-case release scenario, at least one alternative release scenario be identified and analysed for each regulated toxic substance.  Since aqueous ammonia is the only regulated toxic substance used at the facility, only one alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis. \nA.4.2 Scenarios to Consider\nRMP and CalARP regulations require that a scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario be selected as the ARS.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \u0093active\u0094 mitigation, such as automatic shutoff valves and use more typical weather conditions.

It was conservatively assumed that the leak from the pump would completely cover the storage tank containment area.  The containment area has ammonia monitors so a leak from ammonia equipment would be quickly detected.\nUsing the same methodology as above, the ARS release rate would be the same value as for the WCS or 25.5 lbs./min.\nA.4.3 Consideration of Mitigation\nThe passive mitigation provided by the containment area was considered for both the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia.  The storage tanks and associated piping are all outside; therefore no building mitigation was considered. \nA.4.4 Toxic Endpoint Distance for Aqueous Ammonia\nThe dispersion model indicates a distance of 0.11 mile (194 yards) to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario.

The geographical representation of the worst-case release scenario is shown in Figure 2-1.  The residential population and presence of sensitive receptors within the worst-case toxic endpoint will be discussed in the following sections.\nResidential Population\nOMEC used Marplot Version 5.1.1 mapping software, a geographic information system developed by the Office of Emergency Management of the EPA and the Emergency Response Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to determine the potential impact to the residential population surrounding PEC.  This program applies 2010 U.S. Census data to identify the total number of residents within the impact areas.  When calculating population densities for large areas which encompass many tracts, the accuracy is rated as good; however, for small areas that encompass only two or three partial tracts, the population data may be skewed due to the unequal distribution within the tract.\nThe Worst-Case Scenario release from SCR aqueous ammonia tank does not impact any residents.\nOther Public Receptors\nOther public or sensitive receptors were identified within the worst-case toxic endpoint circle for ammonia.

If the tank level continues to fall below 12 inches, a low-low level alarm is generated warning the operator to take immediate action to stop the forwarding pumps.\nSecondary Containment. \nLeak Detection.  Ammonia Leak detectors are located in 3 locations: directly under the ammonia tank, inside of the secondary containment, and in the underground piping leading from the ammonia tank to the ammonia skids.\nSecondary Containment.  The ammonia storage tank is located in containment area that is 50 feet long by 20 feet wide by 5 feet 8 inches deep.  This area is sufficient to contain the full contents of the ammonia storage tank.  The ammonia unloading area has been designed so that any spillage of aqueous ammonia would be directed to a sump where it will be valved and piped to containment.   Rainwater collected on the unloading station and ammonia tank containment will be pumped out as needed.  The containment is equipped with a sump into which a submersible pump can be lowered to pump out the contents when required for disposal.\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash. An emergency shower and eyewash station is located at the truck unloading station, within a few steps of the truck fill and vapor return connections.\nStop Valve. Emergency stop valves are provided on the main liquid line on the tank lines.  The valves position indication is wired directly to the DCS system.  In the event of a fire or ammonia spill, the operator is to manually initiate valve closure.\n \nAPPENDIX D\tDEFINITIONS\n \n\nRMP Program 2 Definitions:\n\nAccidental Release \u0096 Unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the ambient air from a stationary source.\nAdministrative Controls \u0096 written procedural mechanisms used for hazard control\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS) \u0096 A more likely release scenario in average weather conditions. Release scenarios include vessel leak, pipe/hose failure, or pressure relief valve failure.  Modelling of"
