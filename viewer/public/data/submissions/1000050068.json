This is approximately 11 miles east of Platteville and 7 miles north of the intersection of Weld County Road 49 and the exit off Interstate Highway 76.    \n\n\n\nThe Central Oil Stabilization Facility (COSF) receives light oil and condensate via pipeline from multiple well sites in the Denver Julesburg Basin.  The purpose of the facility is to stabilize the condensate and lower its vapor pressure by removing the light hydrocarbons that are dissolved in the condensate.  These light hydrocarbons, which include methane, ethane, propane and butane are removed by heating the condensate in on-site stabilizers.  The light hydrocarbon condensable gases that are removed from the condensate are compressed and liquefied and then stored under pressure as a liquid until pipelined to a gas processing facility for further fractionation.  The methane and ethane is pipelined back to a gas processing facility to be sold down a sales line after further processing.  The stabilized liquids are stored in one of two 250,000 barrel floating roof storage tanks located on the Northeast side of the location before being transferred to the rail loading site near Keensburg, CO or to the Whitecliff pipeline injection point located just south of the COSF. All pumps and compressors on site are electrically powered from purchased power off the grid, however there is on-site emergency generation capability.   \n\n\n\nAll operators are experienced and trained to operate all of the equipment at this facility.  Additionally, the tank levels and critical operating parameters are monitored 24/7 by the operators on-site.  They have the ability to shut the entire facility in from the operations room or from multiple ESD locations strategically located around the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\n\n\nWestern Midstream has a longstanding comm"

Western Midstream has an extensive operator and maintenance training program. Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Western Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. The COSF is a non-responding facility. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to react to such emergencies. If the situation requires, Western Midstream will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. Emergency response agencies have toured the facility and participated in our Facility Response Plan (FRP). Additionally, an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been developed per OSHA PSM requirements and may be used in conjunction with the FRP.  \n\n"
