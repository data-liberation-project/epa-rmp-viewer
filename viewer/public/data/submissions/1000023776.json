This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\r\n\r\n1.0 RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Fleischmann's Yeast facility in Memphis, Tennessee has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia. As part of their release prevention program, the plant has an excellent and detailed preventive maintenance program. More information about these aspects of the prevention program is discussed in Section 3.0 of this Executive Summary.\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and contacting appropriate outside personnel involved in containing an ammonia release - HEPACO (local private HAZMAT team). All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at the Fleischmann's Yeast facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. \r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia. \r\n\r\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nFleischmann's Yeast is a producer of baker's yeast. The NAICS code for the process at this facility is 311999. Fleischmann's Yeast has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used in the process as an ingredient in the manufacturing of baker's yeast.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering the applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the process is documented at approximately 97,600 pounds. This amount exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds so is regulated by the"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nFleischmann's Yeast has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia feed system. At Fleischmann's Yeast, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Thus, Fleischmann's Yeast ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nListed below are key aspects of the ammonia release prevention program:\r\n\r\n1. Most of the pipe work is out of the way of people and the machinery and so there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.  Bollards have been added to increase the protection of the ammonia tank and lines (2011).\r\n\r\n2. The plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n4.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there has been one accidental release at this facility on January 13, 2007 when a fitting failed which resulted in a release of 3,635 pounds.  The accident resulted in one employee injury and no other on-site or off-site impacts.  \r\n\r\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, the Fleischmann's Yeast facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan. The response plan is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel. For all emergencies, Emergency Services Coordinator, has operating authority for emergency response at the site of release and assumes control of the incident scene beyond the first responder awareness level.\r\n\r\nThis document contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; incident team job descriptions; evacuation zones; emergency evacuation procedures; notification proced"
