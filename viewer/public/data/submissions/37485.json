      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\nThe Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) is a Chemical and Propellant manufacturing facility located in Pulaski and Montgomery counties in southwest Virginia.  The installation consists of two non-contiguous areas; the Radford Unit where all of the manufacturing occurs, and a magazine storage area located in Dublin, VA.\n\nThe manufacturing facility at Radford is subject to the Risk Management regulation. It comprises 4,080 acres straddling Pulaski and Montgomery counties, and is located approximately eight miles southwest of Blacksburg and three miles north of Radford. The Dublin storage facility is comprised of 2,821 acres in Pulaski County.  The area surrounding the both areas is mostly agricultural and rural residential.\n\nThe manufacturing processes at the Radford facility involve nitration reactions and processing steps to turn raw materials into such products as propellants and explosives for both military and commercial sale. Nitration involves the use of mixtures of nitric and sulfuric acids. Nitric acid is used up in the nitration reaction and must be replenished. Ammonia is the principal raw material in producing weak (60%) nitric acid using the ammonia oxidation process. Extractive distillation is used to strengthen the manufactured weak nitric up to 98.5%. Sulfuric acid is used in the concentration process. Theoretically, the sulfuric acid assists in the nitration reaction and is also used in the extractive distillation process to strengthen the weak nitric acid. The chief source of makeup sulfuric is purchased oleum. \n\nEther is used as a processing aid in certain propellant formulations. It helps in obtaining the proper consistency of the mixture of explosive (nitrated) compounds for the various mixing, cutting, and shaping operations to create the finished propellants and explosive powders. These propellants and powders must have the proper shape and design in order for them to perform as needed, producing the desired characteristic"

The RFAAP primary activities are Inorganic Chemical and Propellant Manufacturing (NAICS Codes 325188 - Basic Chemical Manufacturing and 32592 - Explosives Manufacturing.).  The four substances stored at RFAAP that are subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 are Nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), Ethyl ether (60-29-7), Ammonia (7664-41-7) and Oleum (8014-95-7).\n\nThe following is a list of the six covered processes and the associated substance at the facility:\n\n1. Ammonia Oxidation Plan - Ammonia\nThe Ammonia Oxidation Plant (AOP) manufactures 61% nitric acid (weak nitric acid) by oxidizing Anhydrous Ammonia in the presence of a catalyst and absorbing the gases into water to form weak nitric acid.  The Ammonia storage facility consists of tanks contained within secondary containment. Mitigation measures include sensors, a water curtain system, pressure and level monitors, safety relief valves, and excess flow valves.\n\nApplicable codes and standards were followed, including ANSI, K 61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Ammonia, Alliant Explosives Standards (AES), and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, ASME B-31.4, ANSI, and ASME Section VIII, Division 1 for pressure vessels.\n\n2.  Manufactured Acid Storage - Strong Nitric Acid\nThe Strong Nitric Acid storage facility consists of storage tanks within secondary containment that connects to RFAAP\u00bfs waste acid treatment system.  In the event of a release, the acid can be discharged to the acid treatment system for neutralization. Design features include drains to the waste acid treatment system, a local pH meter capable of detecting releases, and a capture system on tank vents connecting to a fume scrubber system.\n\n3.  Purchased Acid Storage - Oleum\nOleum is stored for use in the Ammonia Oxidation Plant. The tanks are in a dike that can be drained to t"

The features described above for strong nitric acid also apply to oleum storage, including a fume capture system tied into a SOx fume scrubber.\n\n\n4.  NC Area - Strong Nitric Acid Storage\nThe Nitrocellulose Manufacturing area uses both strong nitric acid (>98.5%) and Oleum to produce Nitrocellulose. The raw cellulose (wood pulp or cotton linters) is nitrated using mixed acid of particular ratios depending on the grade of NC desired. At the acid tank farm, strong nitric and oleum are stored to make up these mixed acids. The spent acid (depleted in nitric) is sent to the acid area for reclamation.\n\nStorage of Strong Nitric Acid and Oleum is within secondary containment that connects to the RFAAP waste acid treatment systems.\n\n5.  NC Area - Oleum\nSee above section; the information for both is included there.\n\n6.  Solvents Area - Ethyl Ether\nEthyl ether is used in processing certain propellants to give the proper consistency for various unit operations related to shaping, extruding, cutting, etc. Solvents are collected for recovery and reuse. The solvents area has the capacity to receive shipments, recover solvents from the process, and store ethyl ether. Tanks are within secondary containment.\n\nProgram Level\nOffsite impacts for all covered processes have been evaluated. Plans for reducing the potential risks of a release and implementation of emergency procedures are coordinated with the local emergency planning commission and information is shared with other manufacturing facilities in our area.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nRFAAP has not had an accidental release from any of the covered processes within the last five years that has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. In fact, in the 64 years that Hercules Incorporated and Alliant have operated RFAAP, there has never been a release of that nature.\n\nPr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess Hazards Analysis\nThe EPA requires that a process hazards analysis (PHA) be conducted for all processes subject to the requirements of Program 3.  The PHAs at RFAAP are conducted appropriately based on the complexity of the process being evaluated. Besides the basic engineering disciplines, RFAAP has a Hazards Analysis group that is experienced in conducting such exercises. Due to the nature of the explosives handled at the facility, this group is a valuable asset in conducting PHAs.\n\nOperating Procedures\nRFAAP has an extensive procedure development and implementation program. An excellent feature that is included in each operating procedure gives the operator the right to refuse to start-up any process at the facility if he does not feel that it is safe or environmentally sound. Operators are also empowered to shut down any operation they deem unsafe. Procedures are written to provide clear instructions for the operation of all processes at RFAAP including covered processes.\n\nApart from operating procedures, RFAAP has extensive procedures for safe work practices including lockout/tag-out, confined space entry, stop and think, and hot work. These safe work practices shall apply to employees as well as contract employees.\n\nAll procedures are updated annually.  Any changes require revision and sign off by affected personnel.\n\nTraining\nEach employee involved in the operation of any process is trained. All training includes an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards associated with equipment and chemicals, emergency operations, and safe work practices. Each operator receives initial training, which involves the reading of the procedure and a walk through of the process operations with the procedure in hand.  Competence in the procedures is determined based on observation by the operator's supervisor.  Every time the procedure is changed each operator must be retrained using the same methods as described for initial training.  If there are no changes to t"

For each employee at RFAAP a record is kept of that employee's required training, the dates of the last training, and when the employee's refresher training is required.  All training records are maintained in the individual operating areas.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTo ensure that the mechanical integrity of process equipment is maintained, RFAAP maintains the following: Written Procedures that maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment, training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing using good engineering practices, identification and correction of deficiencies in a timely manner, and engineering review for suitability of materials of construction.\n\nPreventive Maintenance\nRequirements to perform periodic preventative maintenance for the facility are maintained in a computerized database. The required preventative maintenance work is printed out and assigned to various technicians when the work is required. Frequency is determined by factors such as manufacturer's recommendations, operational experience, and conditions of service.\n\nManagement of Change\nRFAAP utilizes a computer-based management of change (MOC) system. The system is designed to solicit review and approval from the appropriate personnel prior to implementation.  Each MOC document, whether it is to perform a process or procedural change, contains at a minimum the following information: the technical basis for the proposed change, impact of the change to safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.\n\nPre-Start Up Review\nThe Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) at RFAAP conducts pre-start up reviews before a new or modified process is allowed to operate. Equipment changes are also subject to PPCB consideration. Representatives from Safety, Hazards, Environmental, and Operations attend the pre-startup evalu"

If there are deficiencies identified by the PPCB, the process must correct the deficiencies before the process may start up.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRFAAP will verify that the facility is in compliance with the requirements of this RMP every three years.  Other procedures and MOC items are updated and evaluated on a more frequent basis as indicated in previous sections of this document.  Individuals who are knowledgeable of the process will perform compliance audits.  An audit report will be generated identifying any deficiencies.  These deficiencies are tracked to completion to ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAll incidents at RFAAP require investigation. Due to the nature of our business, these investigations are taken very seriously and include incidents that did not result in an actual mishap but it is felt they could have. These are known as \u00bfnear misses\u00bf and are thoroughly analyzed with the findings disseminated to all.\n\nEmployee Participation\nRFAAP requires that operators participate in investigations, PHAs, etc.  They are recognized as an invaluable resource with intimate hands on experience.  As a further means of encouraging open dialogue, a Management Safety Forum was established in which the operators may raise issues and ask questions on any subject, including safety and environmental protection.  Questions that cannot be immediately answered in the meetings are assigned to the appropriate personnel and tracked to completion. Employees are also shown demonstrations regarding the hazards presented by various materials manufactured at the facility. This is done to ensure that operators approach all tasks with the proper respect for such hazards.\n\nHot Work Permits\nDue to the nature of the products manufactured at RFAAP, prevention of fires and related incidents is extremely important.

The booklet has been updated to specifically notify contractors of potential hazards at the facility in general. This precludes them from focusing only on the hazards in their particular worksite.\n\nEmergency Response\nRFAAP has several plans and procedures developed to protect human health and the environment, particularly the RFAAP Hazardous Material Emergency Response Plan, and the Disaster Control Plan.\n\nThe RFAAP Hazardous Material Emergency Response Plan was developed to provide a plan for responding to a hazardous material release that cannot be controlled by area standard operating procedures.  The plan complements the disaster control plan by giving specific direction to the response and control of hazardous material releases.  The plan addresses all substances regulated by 40 CFR 68 as well as other potentially hazardous chemicals. It includes coordination of the emergency response with outside agencies, training of employees and the plant Fire Department, and emergency action guidelines.\n\nThe Disaster Control Plan was developed to ensure that RFAAP is prepared to effect immediate disaster control recovery operations at the installation level in order to ensure the performance of essential functions and responsibilities in times of enemy attack, natural disaster, and civil disturbances.  Accordingly, planning and organization detailed in the plan are aimed at effecting recovery from the most devastating possibility, but flexible enough to permit its adaptation to recovery from any disaster of lesser magnitude.\n\nIn summary, safety has always been viewed as cr"
