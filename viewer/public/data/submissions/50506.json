Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n     At the Ferro South Plainfield site, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of release prevention programs and emergency response programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities that we have designed into and implemented including:\n\n     A description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\n\n     A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from an accidental chemical release;\n\n     An overview of our accidental release prevention programs;\n\n     A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule;\n\n     An overview of our emergency response program;\n\n     An overview of planned activities to improve the prevention program at the facility;\n\n     The certification that the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule requires us to provide; and\n\n     The detailed information about our risk management program.\n\n\nB.     The South Plainfield facility is a producer of precious metal products such as silver solder, pastes, and powders used in the electronics industry.  Formaldehyde solution is used at the facility in the precipitation of metallic silver from precious metal solutions.  These operations are conducted in small batch reactors.\n\n     Formaldehyde solution is stored and used at the facility.  It is distributed to the user equipment in the plant through a piping network.  Formaldehyde solution is delivered by tank truck by several different firms.  Deliveries are sc"

The Worse Case Release Scenario has been determined to be a liquid spill and vaporization from the storage tank.\n\n     The Alternative Release Scenario has been determined to be a transfer hose failure and subsequent liquid release.\n\n     Mitigation measures include dikes, enclosures, scrubbers, vapor detections systems and emergency shutdown devices.  These safety devices are maintained for operational readiness on this system and are included in the periodic preventative maintenance inspections.\n\n\nD.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The prevention program used at the facility is the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  The standard covers management system elements involving safety information, hazard evaluations, operating procedures, employee training, contractor controls, mechanical integrity, pre-startup reviews, incident investigations, safe work practices, and emergency response.\n\n     There are a number of specific measures in place to reduce the likelihood of a release of formaldehyde solution or it's impact.  Two tank level gages monitor the tank liquid level.  These two gauges must read within 100 gallons of each other.  Additional material is not ordered until the tank level is below a predetermined level.  This will allow the total contents of the delivery tank trailer to be safely unloaded into the storage tank.  The storage tank is equipped with a high level monitor and alarm that alerts the driver if the tank level is too high.\n\n     The driver and Ferro personnel are on hand throughout the unloading operation and are able to shut down the operation in the event of a leak before a large release has occurs.  A formaldehyde leak detector sensor is also located inside the tank containment to alert facility personnel if any formaldehyde were to be released into the"

This material is compatible with and resistant to corrosion from formaldehyde solution.\n\n\nE.     Five-year Accident History\n\n     There have been no releases involving formaldehyde at this facility.\n\n\nF.     Emergency Response Program\n\n     Emergencies at the facility are handled according to the sites \"Emergency Preparedness Plan\" which details the actions required to respond to plant emergencies such as chemical spills, medical emergencies, fire, gas leaks, bomb threats, hazardous wastes, explosions and natural disasters.\n\n     The Emergency Response Management Team Chairperson or Vice Chairperson makes decisions regarding the evacuation of personnel and the notification of outside agencies.  If the emergency plan is activated during the off-hours or weekend, the Shift Supervisor with assistance from security personnel will initiate the plan.\n\n     The Hazardous Entry and Abatement Team (HEAT) will respond to chemical spills.  Team members have been trained in response and mitigation techniques.  The Team conducts annual drills and periodic exercises.  Their first response is to stop the release and contain the spread of material.  \n\nAs per N.J.A.C. 7:31-7.2(a)2ii, the formaldehyde storage tank is contained inside a diked area.  The tank and dike are further sheltered on three sides by the production building and on the fourth side by the unloading dock containment area.  The diked area is designed to hold the entire contents of the storage tank plus a minimum of six inches of rainwater.  There are no public waterways in the area of the tank and the dike.  There is a catch basin that connects to the on-site pond.  This pond empties into a drainage ditch that runs along Apgar Road.  There is a valve at the pond outfall to stop the flow in the event of a release into the pond.  There are no residential populations that could be affected until at least one-quarter of a m"

If any spills were to occur during unloading, the material will be collected inside this containment area.  This material would then be pumped to the on-site treatment facility for disposition.\n\n\nG.     Planned Improvement to the Prevention Program\n\nThe five-year review of the Process Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (PHA/RA) has been updated utilizing a cross-functional team that included production management and operators; team leaders, maintenance personnel, EHS staff and an outside EHS consultant.  The PHA/RA was conducted from November 11, 2007 through November 21, 2007 utilizing PHA Works from Primatech Incorporated.\n\nOperating procedures that deal with the formaldehyde system have been reviewed and if necessary revised.  All affected procedures have been updated during October - November, 2007."
