Systems and procedures are in place to assure the safety of the working environment.  The progress against goals is constantly assessed and communicated to the employees.  Achievement of these goals is recognized and rewarded, while failure to attain them is regarded as unacceptable performance.\n\nThe emergency response policy is to respond immediately to any accidental releases or process safety incidents to minimize impact on the employees, public and the environment.  The emergency response teams provide coverage 24 hours a day.  These employees are trained on how to handle emergency situations. \n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented at this site, including:\n\n- A description of the facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation;\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule;\n- An overview of the emergency response program;\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting employees, the public, and the environment; and\n- The certification required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\nSite Identification and Regulated Substances\n\nDPE Pontchartrain Site operates on approximately 1,138 acres in Sections 90, 91, 92 and 93 of Township 115, Range 7 East in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, on property owned by DuPont.  Approximately 200 acres are used for actual manufacturing activities.

Examples of these include:\n\n- Automatic valves for rail cars, which isolate the supply of materials from the rail car in the event of a process upset; \n- Computer display and control of process parameters;\n- Interlocks to automatically shut down processes for certain process deviations;\n- Low concentration chlorine detectors that sound an alarm and provide an alarm signal to the computerized process control system when a leak is detected;\n- Emergency scrubber system to prevent emissions from reaching the environment; \n- Isolation valves which can be operated remotely from the process control system;\n- Deluge systems built into the process to quickly suppress chemical fumes or fires;\n- Check valves to prevent cross contamination of chemicals;\n- Fire prevention activities like electrical grounding, inerting flammables with nonflammable gases and hot work permitting; and\n- Operator surveillance during transfer of hazardous materials from shipping containers.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRecords of all significant accidental chemical releases that occur are kept.  No off-site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage has occurred involving materials and processes covered under the EPA\u00bfs RMP rule during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe site has an Emergency Response Plan, which establishes procedures and responsibilities for the various functions involved in handling any plant emergency, either internal or external to this site.

As a result of these studies, the site continues to implement a number of activities to help identify new risk reduction opportunities and maintain those already implemented. A few of those activities are:\n\n- Continue to improve the control of the process by installing better instrumentation, more automatic process shutdown interlocks, and upgraded computer control systems as replacements are needed;\n- Continue to perform preventive maintenance inspections and improve procedures;\n- Continue improvement of training programs; and \n- Continue conducting process safety audits to identify any deficiencies in the management systems.\n\n\nNote on Prevention Program ID 3 \u00bf Chlorine Storage\n\nThe chloroprene process uses chlorine as a raw material.  Chlorine usage at this process can require that four tanks be unloaded each day.  While the process is operating, the site tries to maintain twenty chlorine tank cars on-site with a stop order point at twenty-five tank cars.  Because the deliver time is seven days, the site may have thirty-five to forty tank cars when the process has a long unscheduled shutdown.  Chlorine storage of the tank cars was chosen as a process for RMP reporting purpose.\n\nThe chlorine tank cars are maintained, inspected and serviced by the chlorine supplier.  Once at the site, DPE performs visual inspections prior to unloading.  If a problem is found with the tank cars, the emergency response team will respond until the chlorine supplier arrives at the site.  \n\nSince DPE does not perform any type of work or maintenance on the chlorine tank cars section 7.7 is not applicable.  June 1, 2009 was entered on this section because leaving it blank will generate errors on the submittal."

DuPont de Nemours & Company and is a global supplier of specialty elastomer products and supporting technologies.  DPE headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware and the company employs approximately 1,300 people worldwide.\n\nDPE offers a wide variety of polymer products that have end-use applications in automotive systems, wire and cable, construction, chemical processing, the general rubber industry, and in high-performance parts with excellent temperature, oil, and chemical resistance.  Examples of the end products that are made with DPE materials include:\n\n- Coatings - from rainwear to liners for roofs and tanks,\n- Automotive products - from power steering pressure hoses to high performance timing belts,\n- Wire and cable insulation - from electrical wiring to nuclear power station cable, and\n- Industrial application - from microwave door enclosures to acid hoses.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency promulgated the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  RMP is a communication process designed to help the public, emergency responders and regulatory agencies understand the risks associated with certain types of facilities.  This executive summary, one of the requirements under the RMP, is provided in compliance with 40 CFR \u00a7 68.15.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe DPE Pontchartrain Site is committed to operating and maintaining all the processes in a safe and responsible manner.

The first process is the portion of the neoprene process which uses nitrogen tetroxide to manufacture DIBN (diisobutylene nitrosate) an inhibitor in the manufacture of neoprene.   The process hazard analysis (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 08-312.  This PHA covers the portion of the neoprene process where nitrogen tetroxide is used.\n\nThe second process is the chloroprene process, which uses chlorine, pentane and 1,3-butadiene as raw materials.  The process hazard analyses (PHA) information in Section 7 was obtained from PHA 08-311.  This is the most recent PHA completed for the portion of the process where these three chemicals are used (the DCB Synthesis and DCB Refining portion of the process.)\n\nThe third process is the chlorine storage.
