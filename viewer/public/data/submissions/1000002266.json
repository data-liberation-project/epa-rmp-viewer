      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) wholesales drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants.  The MWDSC Chemical Unloading Facility (CUF) plays a critical role in supplying chlorine for drinking water disinfection.  The chlorine at CUF is received in rail cars and then transferred to chlorine trailers which supply disinfection processes at various MWDSC water treatment facilities.\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWDSC regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.\n\nThe CUF's chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident an"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials, which are tailored, to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The CUF has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for Hazardous Materials to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).  The CUF has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe CUF was built in 1972, and is located at 19765 Patterson Avenue, in Perris, California.  The facility is situated just west of Interstate Highway 215 and south of the Cajalco Expressway, covering approximately 3.8 acres."

The Transfer Building is located approximately 100 feet west of the Main Office Building.  Empty and full chlorine trailers, are stored in a paved storage area west of the Transfer Building.  In addition, a chlorine rail car may be occasionally located in an area, immediately east of the Transfer Building.  The evaporators and the chlorinators are located in the Control Building No. 3 adjacent to the Transfer Building. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the CUF at any given time is more than the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It is also more than the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  \n\nChlorine leak sensors are provided in the rail car and cargo trailer storage areas, outside the Office Building, inside Control Building No. 3 and inside the chlorine vent box.  In addition, each rail car and chlorine trailer angle valve, which is connected during the unloading process, is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply from the rail car or chlorine trailer can be stopped by closing the shutoff system from any of the five control panels: at the unloading platform, at the east and west sides of the north wall of the Transfer Building, in Control Building No. 3, and in the Main Office center wall. \n\nThe chlorine sensors will trigger alarms on the Main Control Board (Mills Plant control room and the gas detector monitoring station).  Once alerted, fully trained personnel, including the CUF personnel will respond to assess the chlorine leak on a 24-hour basis.\n\nEmergency shower and eye wash stations are also provided around the chlorine unloading, equipment and general maintenance ar"

The CUF mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n- Written procedures for maintaining mechanical integrity through inspection and testing of process equipment, based on instructions of equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and prior operating experience.\n- Implementation of the written procedures by performing inspections and tests on process equipment at specified intervals.\n- Training of maintenance personnel in preventive maintenance program proc"

The CUF uses a permitting and training program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near a process involving chlorine.\n\nThe CUF provides a system and approach to maintain and implement any management of change or modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions.  This system allows CUF staff to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information to existing data before the proposed change would either compromise system safety or need training to be completed.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nInternal compliance audits will be conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  The CUF will assemble an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the process.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe CUF investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendat"

Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff and added or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  There have been no such incidents involving the CUF chlorine system.\n\nFive-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the CUF during the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program Summary\n\nCUF has Technician Level HAZWOPER-trained plant employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases.  CUF also includes employees trained in Incident Command System.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Riverside County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  CUF coordinates with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department) to help ensure that they are familiar with the CUF Chlorine System and its emergency requirements and that it is reflected in their Area Plans.  Specially trained CUF employees will be available during such a chlorine emergency to provide technical support to fire department responders.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNumerous changes to improve safety (recommended actions) were previously identified for the chlorine unloading process in 1992, 1995, 1998 and 2004 when Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) conducted under the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) guidelines, Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program were prepared for the CUF. These recommended actions have been evaluated and implemented as required. Additional changes to improve chlorine safety were identified in May and June of 2009, when the 2004 RMP process hazard analysis was reviewed and updated. It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and i"

This chlorine containment and neutralization project will markedly reduce the accidental release risk to CUF employees, the surrounding community and the environment. Due to ongoing budgetary and economic challenges, the original 2005-08 project was deferred and is now in the design phase, with construction scheduled to begin mid-2012 and expected to be in operation in 2014. \n"
