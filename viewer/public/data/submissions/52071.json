As part of this commitment, GP/Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at GP/Crossett.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n?a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine) ? see topic 1.2\n\n?a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) ?see topic 1.4\n\n?an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes ? see topic 1.6\n\n?a management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one "

In fact, the facility has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards that are designed to minimize the potential for the release of any hazardous substance and injuries and damage resulting from the release of a hazardous substance.\n \nGP/Crossett minimizes the potential releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGP/Crossett limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the facility works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety programs at GP/Crossett consist of a number of elements, only, some of which are required by the RMP Rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP/Crossett is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a m"

GP/Crossett provides response training for upset conditions to facility personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local emergency response organizations.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the facility has established a management system directed by the Vice President Crossett Paper Operations.\n \n1.2  Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations and Our Regulated Substances\n\nGP/Crossett is a pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of brown/bleached paper products. As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) for the use of bleaching pulp.  The facility stores and transfers chlorine (Cl2) for water treatment in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP Rule.  The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3.  The Chlorine System consists of 1- ton cylinders for water treatment at the facility.  The chlorine system is also an RMP Program level 3 covered process.\n\n1.3  Off - Site Consequence Analysis\n\nGP/Crossett performed an off- site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of regulated substances to affect the public or the environment.  The off site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Crossett and, (2) would result in an off- site consequence if the release occurred.  These alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n"

EPA has provided a modeling program (RMP*Comp) to determine the endpoints.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations.  These requirements include:\n\n?one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n?one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\nThe following information summarizes the off- site consequence analysis performed by GP/Crossett.\n\n1.3.1 Program Level 3 Processes - Chlorine (Cl2) Systems and the Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) Solution System\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario for the chlorine dioxide system involves the failure of one 158,000 gallon storage tank.  The RMP Rule mandates, that for the worst-case scenario involving a covered substance normally a gas at ambient temperature and pressure, the analysis assumes loss of the entire contents of the largest storage vessel in ten minutes.

The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of a one-inch diameter transfer line, releasing 150 pounds per minute for 13 minutes before it could be isolated.  The released chlorine will evaporate to form a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration, based on the RMP*Comp output, is 0.6 miles.

The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide six-inch solution line located at the discharge side of the ClO2 transfer pumps' header.  During normal operations, the pump could pump approximately 20 lbs per minute for 5 minutes before the release would be stopped by the automated shut-off valves.

Contractors.  GP/Crossett has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the facility are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  GP/Crossett explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the facility safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures for the facility.  The facility requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site.  The facility periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\nG. Pre-startup Safety Reviews.  GP/Crossett performs a safety review of new or modified equipment in the covered process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\n\n?construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n?adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\n?employee training has been completed\n?for a covered process, a PHA has been performed if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\nA pre-startup safety review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that the appropriate issues have been addressed.\n \nH.
