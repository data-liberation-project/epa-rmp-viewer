      "SummaryText": "                Mennel Milling Company operates a flour mill in Logan, Ohio that processes wheat into many different grades of flour. Several of the grades involve a bleaching process in which chlorine is added to the milled flour. In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the wheat prior to storage and milling to prevent spoilage.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to the Mennel Milling Co. in one (1) ton cylinders. The supplier delivers full chlorine cylinders to the site via truck. The containers are unloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of forklift and portable carts. Mennel Milling staff connects the one (1) ton cylinders to the feed system. The maximum number of one (1) ton cylinders located onsite at any time is six (6).\n\n\n\nThe Mennel Milling Co. uses a system that involves air or water flowing through an educator that creates a vacuum. This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the cylinders into the piping system. If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing a discharge of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario: The worst case scenario involves the rupture and complete loss of chlorine from a full one (1) ton cylinder inside the storage room. The distance to the toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.9 miles. This distance was estimated using a electronic version (RMP Comp Version 2.01) of the methodology presented in the USEPA's \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance\", USEPA, April 1999. The public receptors affected by this worst case scenario included schools, private residences, recreation areas, offices and or industrial facilities. The residential population within the 0.9 mile radius is approximately 5,724 persons and 2,674 households, estimated April 2020 using USEPA's MARPLOT software.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action Plan: The Emergency Action Plan contains measures that the Mennel Milling Company staff can take to"
