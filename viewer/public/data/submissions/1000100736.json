      "SummaryText": "1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nUNFI's Fort Wayne Distribution Center (DC) is a wholesale food distribution facility serving retail stores throughout Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  UNFI's Fort Wayne Distribution Center is located a 4815 Executive Blvd. in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\r\n\r\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nUNFI uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management (RMP) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and OSHA Regulation under 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM).  To date UNFI's Fort Wayne DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment.\r\n\r\n3.0\tWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter for details the worst and alternate case release scenarios and other scenarios considered.\r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nPursuant to RMP/PSM regulations, UNFI has developed a comprehensive PSM/RMP written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals located on site. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and subsequent 5 Year PHA Revalidations for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA's were completed using technical and operations staff from th"

      "SummaryText": "e facility as well as ammonia refrigeration contractors and Corporate Personnel. \r\n\r\nUNFI's implementation of the PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system. \r\n\r\n5.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nTo date UNFI's Fort Wayne DC has not experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected employees, residents or the environment in the last five years.\r\n\r\n6.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nUNFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration process at the Fort Wayne DC.  Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. UNFI's employees are involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs. Management is committed to working with local agencies and the community to educate the public regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at UNFI should be address to the Facility Manager at the Fort Wayne DC and/or UNFI's Environmental Department.\r\n\r\n7.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nUNFI is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of UNFI to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system."
