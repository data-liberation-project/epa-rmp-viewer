It also ensures that all employees and contractors\r\naffected by the change are notified and/or trained prior to commissioning the \r\nchange.  Where necessary, field verification occurs to ensure that actual \r\nc"

If\r\nthe change were determined to be too extensive or complex for a PSSR, a PHA would\r\nbe performed in addition to a PSSR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  8.0 Mechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nKrotz Springs Refinery has practices and procedures in place to ensure that equipment has been \r\ndesigned, constructed, installed and maintained to contain the chemicals in the\r\nprocess. Any equipment or system used to store, process and handle highly hazardous \r\nchemicals is included in the mechanical integrity program.  Also, any other process \r\nequipment, safety equipment and backup safety systems used to minimize the impact of \r\na release are included in the program. \r\n\r\nMechanical components and systems including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping \r\nsystems, piping components, relief systems, vent systems, emergency shutdown \r\nsystems, safety equipment, monitoring devices, pumps, etc. are maintained through:\r\n\r\n * Written procedures\r\n * Training\r\n * Inspection and testing (predictive and preventive maintenance)\r\n * Safely/quickly correcting equipment deficiencies\r\n * Quality assurance\r\n\r\nWritten procedures supply the guidance necessary to correctly repair, install and \r\nperform predictive/preventive maintenance on critical equipment in a consistent,\r\nsafe manner. \r\n\r\nTraining is supplied through craft procedures and specialized training applicable\r\nto the craft and process.  This training and the procedures are kept current through\r\nthe management of change process.  All of this training is intended to provide\r\ncraftsmen with the knowledge to maintain equipment integrity, or repair equipment\r\nwhile performing the work in a safe manner.\r\n\r\nBoth the type and frequency of initial and on-going inspection and testing of\r\nequipment are based on applicable codes, standards, and/or manufacturer's\r\nrecommendations. The results of these inspection and testing methods are used \r\nto modify or create predictive and preventive maintenanc"

Each work order is prioritized\r\nto help assure that an equipment problem is corrected in a timely manner to better\r\nassure more reliable and safe operation.  Additionally, the frequency of the\r\ninspection and testing is adjusted accordingly to improve the predictive\r\nand preventive maintenance.\r\n\r\nQuality assurance is an integral part of mechanical integrity.  Throughout\r\nall aspects of this element, the mechanical integrity program provides\r\nappropriate checks and balances to assure that equipment, spare parts,\r\nmaintenance materials are installed properly, meet design specifications\r\nand follow manufacturers instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  9.0 Hot-Work/Safe Work Permit Practices\r\n\r\nKrotz Springs Refinery has many safe work practices in place to safely perform job task in or\r\nnear refinery process areas.  Issuance of Hot Work Permits is only one of the\r\nmany procedures used.  Examples of others include:\r\n\r\n * Lock, Tag, Try Procedure (S&HG #11) - procedure to provide safeguards or barriers \r\nat those points where unwanted energy flow could result in injury and/or damage.\r\n * Working with Inert Atmospheres (S&HG #32) - procedure to protect Krotz Springs Refinery and \r\ncontractor personnel while working in or near an inert atmosphere.\r\n * Trenching and Excavation Procedure (S&HG #19) - procedure to ensure the safety \r\nof refinery and contract personnel engaged in trenching and excavation work.\r\n * Dock Hot Work (S&HG #12) - permit and procedure to control spark producing \r\nactivities and equipment while work is performed at refinery docks.\r\n * Hot Tapping/In Service Welding (S&HG #7)  -- procedure written to ensure that \r\nestablished safe work practices are used when welding on or cutting into process\r\nlines that are kept in service.\r\n * Refinery Blinding Procedures (S&HG #6) - procedure written to ensure that whe"
