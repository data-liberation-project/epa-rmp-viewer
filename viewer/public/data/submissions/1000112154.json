Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety systems incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Lima LP Terminal.\n \nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 60,000 gal. pressure vessel.  The butane is then pumped to a blending/injection skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid, analyzer and PLC.  Process safety controls include internal/excess flow valves, fusible elements (<250 degrees Fahrenheit), emergency shut-off valves (fail safe), fill shutoff on the vessel, manual emergency shutoff devices (ESDs) throughout and on the video display terminal, line hydrostatic pressure reliefs, and component grounding.   Secondary to the primary rack blending is product tank batch blending which allows for the offload of butane directly into product tank recirculation stream during the summer season.  \n\nAccess to the Lima LP Terminal is restricted to employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors. \n\nB.
