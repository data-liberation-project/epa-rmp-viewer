      "SummaryText": "The Kankakee River Metropolitan Agency (KRMA) Wastewater Treatment Facility services the metropolitan areas of the City of Kankakee, the Village of Bradley, the Village of Bourbonnais, and the Village of Aroma Park.  The primary responsibility of KRMA is to provide wastewater treatment to the Kankakee River Valley in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the USEPA. \r\n\r\nThe treatment process, which is a conventional activated sludge system, includes screening, grit removal, primary clarification, anaerobic digestion, aeration, secondary clarification, disinfection (chlorine gas), and dechlorination (sodium bisulfate).  The facility stores up to nine (9) 1- ton chlorine cylinders during the chlorination season (May 1st thru October 31st).  Four (4) cylinders are manifold on a vacuum feed system at all times (2 feeding, 2 on standby), and the other 5 are available to swap out the empties.    \r\n\r\nKRMA has increased safety of the chlorine facility not only by fencing the facility in, but also by combining state of the art alarm systems that include visual, audible, and paging via SCADA.  With newly added alarm sensors and vacuum feed equipment, any chlorine gas release would be minimized due to the automatic shut down features that would initiate if the system lost vacuum for any reason.  Standard operating procedures call for 4 cylinders to be manifold at all times, with 2 online and 2 in the standby mode.  Chlorine is fed from the cylinders through regulators under vacuum created by feed pumps located in our concrete contact tanks.  The chlorine feed rate is controlled electronically to maintain a set point.  The chlorine regulators allow the system to switch from one cylinder to another depending on its weight.  Since the system is operated on a vacuum, the regulators automatically shut down if vacuum is lost.  This safety feature reduces the potential volume of chlorine that would be released due to a leak or a break in a line from the cylinder to the fee"

The regulator would also stop the chlorine flow if the feed pumps should fail. \r\n\r\nThe feed control equipment is housed in a concrete block building equipped with chlorine leak sensors connected to audible, visual, and pager alarms controlled by SCADA. The room has a ventilation fan that is activated when door opens.  The one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored outside on a concrete platform with steel chock supports below a corrugated steel roof.  The cylinders are delivered by flat bed truck and are unloaded by an electric hoist system above the steel chocks.  After full cylinders are positioned, the empties are loaded on the truck and taken from the site.  The cylinder's operating valves are protected by steel dome covers which are removed only when cylinders are put online.  The chlorine usage per year averages approximately 40 cylinders.  The contracted chemical supplier is responsible for the safe delivery, transportation, and integrity of all cylinders.  They are also required annually prior to chlorination season, to conduct chlorine safety training, and the proper use of the B Kit for the KRMA staff with a trainer certified by the Chlorine Institute.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 112&reg; requires that the Risk Management Plan contain both a Worst Case Scenario, and an Alternate Case Scenario.  The worst case scenario involves a release of all in process quantities of gas to be released in a ten minute time span.  It will be further assumed that all active process equipment would fail in this scenario.  This event would release approximately 8,000 pounds of chlorine from the 4 manifold cylinders that were online assuming they were full.  Based on tables supplied by USEPA, the affected area would encompass approximately a 2.7 mile radius around the facility.  The affected population would be approximately 50,000 people based on the 2010 census. This would also include several schools, nursing homes, shopping areas, and two local hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe selected alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative scenario involves chlorine gas being released through a one quarter inch hole in a single one ton cylinder.  Such a release would occur with the loss of a fusible plug due to excessive heat, which would cause a pressure increase in the cylinder.  The fusible plug is designed to release chlorine gas in a controlled way when extremely high temperatures cause excessively high pressure in a tank.   The plug would then give way, avoiding a catastrophic release.  Based on the USEPA table, the effected release radius would be approximately 0.1 miles.  Increasing the diameter of the hole, simulating the breakage of a discharge valve would increase the radius potential to 0.2 miles.  This scenario would have a potential off site impact on 29 nearby residence with approximately 120 occupants.  It should be noted that the 29 homes within the 0.2 radius are located at a significantly higher elevation than the chlorine storage.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and would collect in the low areas.  All homes are located to the east and northeast of the facility.  If the wind direction is not from the south or southwest the residential area could experience little or no impact from a release.  The south perimeter is joined by the Kankakee River.  Consideration must be noted that the temperature and pressure changes will affect the release rate.  As the gas leaks, the evaporation will cause the liquid to cool reducing gas pressure.  The reduction of both temperature and pressure will cause a decrease in the release rate.\r\n\r\nThere have been no chlorine gas releases during the past five (5) year period.  The KRMA Facility also has an outstanding safety record with 269 days without a lost time accident.\r\n\r\nThe Contingency Plan for a chlorine emergency involves contacting both the fire and police departments of the City of Kankakee, and the Village of Bradley.
