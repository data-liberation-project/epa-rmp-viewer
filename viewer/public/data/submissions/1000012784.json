Allen Water Reclamation Facility (Water Reclamation Facility) owned and operated by the City of Bartow is a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) wastewater treatment plant.  An integral component of the treatment plant is chlorine (Cl2) used for wastewater disinfection.  The Cl2 storage capacity of the facility is 8,000 pounds.  This inventory exceeds the 2,500-pound threshold for Cl2 set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, the City of Bartow has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \r\n\r\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\nOur Wastewater Director has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Wastewater Director has assumed the role of RMP Coordinator.  The RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.\r\n\r\nThe following sections identify the specific responsibilities for each aspect of our risk management and process safety management programs.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\r\n\r\nThe Wastewater Director has the responsibility for (1) ensuring that offsite consequence analyses for each regulated process are consistently performed and documented in accordance with Sections 68.20 through 68.39 and (2) selecting the scenarios that will be reported in the facility Risk Management Program Plan as required under Section 68.165.  The Wastewater Director also is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accord"

The worst case scenario has been defined and the distance to the toxic endpoint as predicted by the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plant Reference Tables was determined. In addition to the worst case scenario, an alternative release scenario has been modeled employing more appropriate meteorological conditions and release assumptions.  In the alternative release scenario.  \r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Water Reclamation Facility has had no reportable releases of Cl2 since the commencement of operations at the facility in 1994.  We have always taken a pro-active stance in the safety of our employees and the surrounding community and environment.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nThe RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for ensuring that the facility has an integrated, effective, and compliant prevention program that meets EPA RMP (Sections 68.65 through 68.87 of the RMP rule) and OSHA PSM requirements (where applicable).  \r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for process safety information (PSI) (Section 68.65 of the RMP rule) including the process chemical information, process technology information, and equipment information is assigned to the Wastewater Supervisor.  The Wastewater Director has the responsibility of ensuring that all of this information is readily accessible for use.\r\n\r\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, the Wastewater Director has the responsibility for ensuring that process hazard analyses (PHAs) are scheduled, conducted, and documented..  The Wastewater Director may also use outside contractors/consultants to lead PHAs when appropriate.  The Wastewater Director is responsible for (1) ensuring that the information and personnel necessary to conduct PHAs are available according to"
