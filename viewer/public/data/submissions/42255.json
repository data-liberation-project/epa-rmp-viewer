The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Padonia Grain Farmers, Hiawatha location, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and retail sales of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 200,000 pounds in two 12,000  gallon storage tanks and all nurse tanks.\n\n3. Due to security concerns, model data is not stated for the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario in this executive summary, only release perameters.  \n\nA. The worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank due to some catastrophic event causing a total release over 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint was calculated to the point of dispersion to 200 ppm.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is based on the most likely potential incident that would result in an offsite leak; a transfer hose failure.  We assumed that such a release would occur for a two-minute period of time.  The distance to the endpoint was calculated to the point of dispersion to 200 ppm.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nPadonia Grain Farmers, Inc. has implemented a safety program that details the proper operations of the anhydrous ammonia facility, including step-by-step procedures for day-to-day operations as well as periodic checks to ensure proper equipment use and maintenance.  This program encorporates the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requi"

The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
