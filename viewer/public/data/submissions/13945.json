Public receptors are located within the release area.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Water Treatment Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine system and identified action items are expected to be completed by 06/21/2002.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place at the Water Treatment Plant.

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Treatment Plant provides treated water to residential, commercial and industrial sectors of the City and surrounding areas.  Raw water is processed and disinfected with  chlorine in the treatment process. The Water Treatment Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 14,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Water Treatment Plant since operation began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the Plant.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of potential accidental releases of chlorine at the Water Treatment Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 SLAB Atmospheric Dispersion Model, an EPA-recognized computer modeling program, was used to model a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for chlorine.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is a model of a release under specific conditions established by EPA, including release volume, duration, and weather conditions. Active safety systems in place at the Plant that are designed to minimize the effects of a chlorine release cannot be considered in the worst case scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is required to assume the release in a ten minute period of the entire contents of the largest vessel of the regulated chemical onsite, which for the Water Treatment Plant is a one-ton chlorine container.  Meteorological conditions required by EPA rules are assumed for the release.  The toxic endpoint for the worst case release scenario is estimated to reach a point offsite of the facility.  The chlorine vapor is would reach nearby public receptors, but no sensitive environmental receptor"
