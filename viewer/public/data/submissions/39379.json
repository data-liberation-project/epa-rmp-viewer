EXECUTIVE SUMMARY [40 CFR 68.155/CALARP 2745.3]\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\nMann Packing Co. operates a processing, shipping and cooling facility in Salinas, CA.  Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions.  The fixed system supports cold storage, ice making, water chilling, pressure cooling and hydro cooling.  There is ammonia detection in the mechanical room for alarming.  The portable systems have no detection since the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and the maintenance program.\nEmergency response training will be conducted periodically for current general employees and as required for new general employees.  The refrigeration team will participate in formal emergency response training and RETA certification as needed.  The refrigeration team will annually review and train on the Emergency Response Plan, operating procedures, MSDS?s, personal safety and first aid procedures, as well as an overview of the RMP/PSM document.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE DESCRIPTION\nAmmonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, water chilling, produce pre-cooling, and ice generation.  A fixed system is attached to the main storage and processing building and is used for cold storage, water chilling, ice gene"

      "SummaryText": "ration, and hydro cooling.  There are refrigerated docks and holding rooms remote from the main facility that are supported by portable trailer mounted refrigeration units.  These portable units also support three vacuum cooling tubes.  The fixed refrigeration system was started in 1980 and is designed as per current applicable building and safety codes.  The remote dock was started in 1994 and a holding room was added to the dock in 1995.  These rooms are also up to current codes and standards.  A broccoli drier with refrigeration coils was added in 2001, built as per current codes, and contains an internal ammonia detection system.  Portable units vary in age but are well maintained and in good condition.  The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 34,500 LBS.  \nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed. Both the worst case and an alternative release scenario were modeled for this RMP/PSM utilizing a computer-modeling program (ALOHA).  The worst-case scenario had a toxic endpoint calculated at 2.1 miles. The residential population affected by this worst-case release is estimated to be 46,196. The alternative release scenario had a toxic endpoint calculated at 0.295 mile. There is no residential population affected by this alternative case release. \nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nWORST CASE SCENARIO ? The worst-case release is based on the release of the maximum amount in the "

      "SummaryText": "largest vessel of the largest system.  Release duration was 10 minutes with ambient conditions as required by EPA regulations.  This results in a 1,500-lbs./minute release for a total release of 15,000 lbs. The maximum radius of impact is 2.1 miles to a toxic end point of 200 ppm.\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ? The alternate was a release for 17 minutes averaging approximately 105 lbs/minute.  This is a more probable release due to items such as rotating seals, pressure relief valves, and leaks in piping, charging system or draining oil.  This scenario is based on a high-pressure liquid release from a 1.4-inch diameter opening. This represents a potential release from a flange or fitting separation. The maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm is 1,557 ft for average meteorology.\nThere are various measures in place or recommended as risk reduction in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to limit the endpoint distances of a release.  One is an ammonia monitoring system for early detection.  There is an emergency control box at the main cold storage system for manual pressure release. Another recommendation is to add an ammonia diffuser tank and tie the emergency control box and all system reliefs into this tank. Relief valves of the portable systems supporting the vacuum cooling and remote cold storage are tied into an ammonia diffuser water tank.  Preventive maintenance and safety inspections are used to insure equipment and piping is maintained and operating in a safe manner.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nMann maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release. A Risk Management Program that includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained on-site along with this RMP/PSM. \nThe ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  The refrigeration team is trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system.  An alarm and detection system monitors the main plant mechanical room for unsafe ammonia concentration levels and for operating conditions outside of safety set points.  An emergency control box and diffuser at the main facility allows system pressure to be relieved manually.  All relief valves at the remote dock and holding room are tied into an ammonia diffuser tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nSince facility startup, there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures.  The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary, and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.  \nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nSpecific recommendations resulting from the PHA are listed in the Prevention Program as Correction Items.  All refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel.  Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
