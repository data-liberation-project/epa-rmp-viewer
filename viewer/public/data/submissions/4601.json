Our KEEP management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for through KEEP.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Ultra-Pure One (UP-1) Plant is operated by Koch Microelectronic Service Company, Inc. (Koch).  At the facility, we receive anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF), anhydrous ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and isopropyl alcohol via rail and truck.  These raw products are then purified through a number of processes and shipped out to customers via rail cars or trucks.  The facility supplies customers with purified hydrofluoric acid (49% to 70% concentration), hydrochloric acid (up to 38% concentration) isopropyl alcohol, and ammonium hydroxide (29% concentration).  Ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) present at the UP-1 Plant in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  There are no flammable "

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur, our 5 year accident history, and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n \nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals would be the loss of all of the HF in our largest vessel within 10 minutes.  In the case of the UP-1 Plant, this would involve our 12,050 gallon pressurized tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance that vapors could travel, in this hypothetical case, would be 25 miles from our facility.  Although we have active mitigation measures in place to prevent such releases (high level/pressure alarms, emergency shutdown, interlocks, deluge systems, and others) and to manage their consequences, the only control taken into account when modeling this scenario was that the release would occur inside a building.  \n\nAs required by EPA, an alternative release scenario which is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario must be reported for each toxic chemical.  The alternative release scenarios that could involve offsite exposure to a toxic chemical, are calculated to reach 1.0, 0.6, and 0.3 miles from the release point for ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF, respectively.  These distances are also based on the EPA OCA methods, which are known to overpredict the impact of any potential release from such a scenario. \n\nThe ammonia alternative release scenario is based on a release of ammonia during truck unloading due to an overfill of the ammonia storage vessel.

These valves ensure that the entire vessel does not rupture and only a minor controllable release results.  Excluding any active mitigation measures in the calculations, the 2-inch diameter valves could release the ammonia at a rate of approximately 0.7 tons per minute.  We have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur: \n\n7 The unloading operation is at a pressure (200 psig) that is lower than the established pressure of the relief valves (250 psig).  In other words, the compressor which fills the tank is incapable of delivering a pressure of 250 psig.\n7 The level of liquid ammonia is measured during the filling process and the compressor will automatically shut off should the level reach a high level setpoint. \n7 The unloading operation is monitored by Koch personnel continuously so that any problems would be detected prior to an overfill of the vessel.\n7 Fire monitors are available to knock down any vapor that may be released.\n7 If a release of ammonia occurred and the fire water system was implemented, there is secondary containment that would ensure that the resulting wastewater is disposed of properly.\n \n The hydrochloric acid alternative release scenario is based on a release of hydrochloric acid through the relief valve on the storage tank due to an overfill of the tank. If such an incident occurred and our active mitigation failed, the relief valve on the tank would be activated during the filling process.  This valve ensures that the entire tank does not rupture and only a minor controllable release results.

If such an incident occurred, HF could be released from the building at a rate of 12.5 pounds per minute.  In calculating this distance, we took credit for the release occurring inside a building, however, we took no credit for any of our other mitigation measures.  We have several active mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur: \n \n7 The HF Barn vents to a scrubber system (2 scrubbers in series) which removes vapors at a 99.9% efficiency rate.\n7 The HF Barn is equipped with a vapor detection system.  If vapor is detected, a high concentration alarm is activated.\n7 If a higher concentration is detected by the vapor detection system, an emergency shutdown occurs and a deluge system is activated to absorb vapors in the building.\n \n The presence of these active mitigation measures serves to both prevent these scenarios from occurring and minimize their impact if they do occur.  We have discussed these potential ammonia, hydrochloric acid, and HF releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in the City of Bryan and Brazos County, and prepared response plans to further reduce the possibility of any impact on the public.\n \n \n Prevention Program\n \n The UP-1 Plant operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA"

At the facility, we emphasize continual analysis of the potential hazards of our process, training of our employees, and on-going safety awareness.  Part of the PSM program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n \n7 All processes have a combination of interlocks and emergency shutdowns to ensure cessation of product movement within the plant if a problem were to arise.\n7 All process areas have deluge systems which are automatically activated by chemical detection or, conversely, can be manually activated if necessary.\n7 HF is unloaded inside a building which vents to a scrubber and has a deluge system with secondary containment.\n7 The HF acid and ammonia unloading and/or loading operations are covered by a canopy and are equipped with a deluge system and secondary containment.\n7 Fire water monitors cover 100% of the process area to ensure that fires are extinguished or vapor clouds can be knocked down.\n7 Scrubber systems have been installed in the HF, ammonia and hydrochloric acid processes to ensure at least 99% removal of any emissions.\n \n These safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since its inception.\n \n \n Five Year Accident History\n \n No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from the release of an RMP substance has occurred at the UP-1 Plant within the last five years.
