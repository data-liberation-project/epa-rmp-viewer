      "SummaryText": "THE CITY OF SALISBURY WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \r\n3/28/14\r\n\r\n1.\tThe City of Salisbury Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has developed an Emergency Response Plan which complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management standard and the US EPA's Emergency Response Plan.  The plan provides employees guidance on what to do in case of a chemical discharge emergency.  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the event of a leak, the Salisbury Fire Department will be contacted to provide Haz - Mat Team response.  The LEPC will be contacted as well. \r\n\tWWTP Leadership/personnel will act as liaison to the FD Command and Control.  \r\n\tAll other WWTP personnel will be evacuated.   \r\n\r\n2.\tThe City of Salisbury WWTP now treats approximately 5.0 million gallons per day of wastewater.  \r\n\t\r\n3.  A review of the offsite consequence Worse Case Scenario analysis for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, utilizing RMP * Comp Ver. 1.07 resulted in the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP*Comp Ver. 1.07\r\nResults of Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nChemical: Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous)\r\nCAS #: 7446-09-5\r\nCategory: Toxic Gas\r\nScenario: Worst-case\r\nLiquefied under pressure\r\nQuantity Released: 2000 pounds\r\nRelease Duration: 10 min\r\nRelease Rate: 110 pounds per min\r\nMitigation Measures: Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\r\n\r\nTopography: Urban surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area)\r\nToxic Endpoint: 0.0078 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\r\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.9 miles (1.4 kilometers)\r\n\r\n--------Assumptions About This Scenario---------\r\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\r\nStability Class: F\r\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP*Comp Ver. 1.07\r\nResults of Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nChemical: Chlorine\r\nCAS #: 7782-50-5\r\nCategory: Toxic Gas\r\nScenario: Worst-case\r\nLiquefied under pressure\r\nQuantity Released: 2000 pounds\r\nRelease Duration: 10 min\r\nRelease Rate: 110 pounds per min\r\nMitigati"

As stated previously, training will be brought to up to a proper level, with associated documentation. \r\n\tStandard Operating Procedures, including transferring and changing cylinders has been formulated and instituted.  \r\n\tA process safety management and risk management audit was performed by the Wicomico County Emergency services on August 19, 2013.\tThere have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, at the WWTP, since the initial RMP/PSM Plan submittal. \r\n\r\n7.  The following changes to improve safety for ourselves and the community have been accomplished:\r\n\tA documentation form for cylinder hoist inspection has been instituted.\r\n\tReplacement of the tank flexible feed lines once per year. The chemical dispensing equipment and chemical distribution lines were replaced with new equipment in the summer of 2012. \r\n\tA permanent water feed line was installed, serving the Chlorination/Dechlorination Building.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n8.\tThe Chlorination/Dechlorination system will be removed from service at some future date as it is scheduled to be replaced by an Ultra Violet disinfection system in the next Waste Water Plant  upgrade."
