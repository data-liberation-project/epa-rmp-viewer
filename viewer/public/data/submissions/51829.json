The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  The RMP was filed with the cognizant Administrative Agency, Tulare County Environmental Health, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) regulations at 19 CCR 2735.\n\nThis revised RMP is being re-certified and filed with USEPA and Tulare County to correct the program level and the inventory of RS's, and to update other information.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District operates the Trauger Pumping Plant and several other irrigation water storage and distribution facilities near Lindsay in Tulare County, and uses chlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The Trauger Pumping Plant is located adjacent to a U. S. Bureau of Reclamation canal in a rural area.  There are 16 full-time em"

The chlorine is used to disinfect the irrigation water.  The ton containers are used at the Trauger Pumping Plant, and the 150-lb. cylinders are transported by District vehicle to remote sites.  At the Trauger pumping plant, pressurized chlorine gas within a ton container is passed through a pressure reducing valve and the pressure is subsequently reduced to vacuum at vacuum regulator valves mounted inside the chlorinators.  In the chlorinators, the chlorine under vacuum is metered through rate valves and rotameters, and drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water through an injector.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at the Trauger Pumping Plant be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, t"

The Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 covering the chlorine receiving, storage, and feeding processes at the Trauger Pumping Plant.  This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the chlorine process at the Trauger Pumping Plant.  The Program and Document Management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, installing a chlorine leak detector in the chlorine room, installing trunnions for the ton containers, and discontinuing the practice of storing ton containers in the garage.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District's Emergency Action Plan applicable to accidental releases of chlorine at the Trauger Pumping Plant consists of notification of local hazardous materials First Responders and evacuating the facility.  This plan has been coordinated with the local agency responsible for hazardous materials release response coordination, Tulare County Environmental Health Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis recommendations in progress of implementation include modifying the chlorine ton container feeding system to utilize vacuum regulator valves mounted on the ton container gas valves, among other items.  All other improvements and mitigation measures identified in the Process Hazard Analysis which the Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation District committed to accomplish have been completed or are in progress.
