Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Mountain View Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Mountain View Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Mountain View Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical         | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia          40,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n\n\nMountain View Cold Storage has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Organized the program so that it meshes closely with general Mountain View Cold Storage business practices\n\n3. Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary Mountain View Cold Storage employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nMountain View Cold Storage operates a commercial cold storage facility in Reedley, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\n(5) Cold Storage Rooms\n\n(4) Precool Rooms\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n(1) Summeripe Room \n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nAll control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within a refrigeration machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nMachinery Room\n\n(1) Frick RXB-24 Screw Compressor\n\n(1) Frick RXB-39 Screw Compressor\n\n(1) Frick RXB-50 Screw Compressor\n\n(1) Frick RWB II-134 Screw Compressor\n\n(5) Horizontal Oil Separators\n\n(4) Shell and Tube Oil Coolers\n\n(1) Plate and Frame Oil Cooler\n\n(2) 60\" Dia. x 28'-0\" Horizontal High Pressure Receivers\n\n(1) 18\" Dia. x 3'-6\" Vertical Liquid Transfer Vessel\n\n(1) 42\" Dia. x 8'-0\" Horizontal Main Suction Accumulator\n\n(1) 24\" Dia. x 6'-0\" Horizontal Thermosyphon Vessel\n\n\n\nCondenser Area\n\n(1) BAC.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\n\n\n\nThere is ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at a normal rate of 20 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe.

The high side of the system has two valves that would discharge to atmosphere. The low side has one valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Mountain View Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nMountain View Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Mountain View Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and tr"

Nevertheless, Mountain View Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Mountain View Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Mountain View Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
