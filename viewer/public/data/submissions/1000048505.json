As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Mountain View Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Mountain View Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Mountain View Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical         | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia          40,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety.

From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\r\n\r\nThere is ammonia detector installed inside the refrigeration machinery room. The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate the mechanical ventilation system at a normal rate of 20 air changes per hour and activate an audible alarm and strobe.

The high side of the system has two valves that would discharge to atmosphere. The low side has one valve that would discharge to atmosphere.

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nMountain View Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.
