This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDegussa-Huls has a nine-point policy guiding the accidental release prevention program. These are:\n\n1) Use applicable design safety codes and standards as the basis for design, construction, operation, and maintenance in our facilities.\n2) Evaluate facilities, equipment and processes for safety and health concerns.\n3) Use multiple safeguards to provide layers of protection in the design, construction and operation of facilities, in order to prevent a single failure from escalating into a catastrophic event.\n4) Document the safety and health evaluation.\n5) Inspect and evaluate process equipment against the design specifications.\n6) Maintain current and complete documentation of the process and equipment throughout the lifetime of the process.\n7) Develop a Management of Change procedure to control minor changes to process technology, operation and maintenance that may affect the safety of the process.\n8) Review all changes to process equipment, procedures and practices to ensure the continued safety of employees and facilities.\n9) Develop inspection and maintenance programs that ensure the continued integrity of facilities.\n\n\nDegussa-Huls has a nine-point policy guiding the emergency response program.

This facility employs 786 personnel. Eight production areas produce 15 products in a continuous production schedule, operating 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: acrolein, ammonia, chlorine, epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid, methyl mercaptan, propylene, trichlorosilane, and trimethylamine.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 400,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the chlorine storage tank from containing over this amount. Although we have "

According to EPA's model RMP*Comp, the release would reach offsite endpoints such as public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the site is a catastrophic failure of one storage tank containing 400,000 pounds of propylene over a 10-minute period forming a vapor cloud which subsequently explodes. Administrative procedures and equipment interlocks prevent the propylene storage tank from containing over this amount. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario. According to EPA's model RMP*Comp, the 1 psi overpressure boundary from the explosion would reach offsite but would not reach any public or environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ARS) for acrolein is ?\" hole in a 2\" transfer line at operating pressure and ambient temperature. The hole results from a partial gasket failure or line damage resulting in a release of 1,100 pounds of gas over a 15-minute period.  The 15-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, depressurize the line and thus stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. This release has the potential to reach offsite endpoints including public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe ARS for ammonia is ?\" hole in a 2\" transfer line at operating pressure and ambient temperature. The hole results from a partial gasket failure or line damage resulting in a release of 1,600 pounds of gas over a 15-minute period.

The 15-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary to detect the leak, depressurize the line and transfer the spilled material into containment.

We have no incidents in the last five years that meet the RMP reporting requirements.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nDegussa-Huls maintains a written emergency response program. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
