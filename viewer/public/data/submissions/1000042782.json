      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0 Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Kraft Foods facility in New Ulm, Minnesota has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of anhydrous ammonia (hereafter, anhydrous ammonia will be referred to as ammonia). The facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This system uses a real time database to track preventive maintenance, training and inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups. In 2014 we moved the majority of our Ammonia lines to the roof (outside). \r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage, 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as with the New Ulm Fire Department, in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKraft manufactures various cheese, snack products and other food service products at the New Ulm, Minnesota plant. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is (311513). This facility is capable of producing and packaging various cheese, snack products and other food service products for consumers.  Kraft has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 at the, New Ulm, Minnesota plant - ammonia.  The storage and process areas of the plant are refrigerated by ammonia to keep the products fresh and wholesome.  Ammonia has been widely used as a refrigerant in the food industry for decades.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 75,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nAmmonia  is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive, pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not po"

      "SummaryText": "isonous, but it can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause burns.  The potential risks to people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor, and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at KraftA\u00bfs New Ulm plant, a release from the ammonia refrigeration system could potentially affect employees on-site and the general public off-site.  USEPA requires companies to use models for A\u00bfworst-caseA\u00bf and A\u00bfalternativeA\u00bf release scenario for each regulated chemical. Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.  If release occurred, however, the alternative scenario would be more likely.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia release scenario was modeled using SLAB (June 1990 version) to obtain the distance to the ERPG-2 endpoint.  The Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level A\u00bf 2, ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  It refers to the level of ammonia that individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without being subjected to irreversible or other serious health effects that could make it difficult for them to leave the affected area.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an OSHA PSM  program for  their  ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, KraftA\u00bfs ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document. \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are ke"

      "SummaryText": "y:\r\n\r\n(a). Utility personnel are present on site and assigned to the ammonia system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year round.  \r\n\r\n(b). There is an ammonia detection system which alerts the utility personnel, which is staffed continuously.\r\n\r\n(c). Most of the ammonia pipe work is located away from employee traffic patterns and machinery to minimize the chance of an ammonia release.\r\n\r\n(d). The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures (monthly drills with the emergency response team and annual drill with the New Ulm fire department).\r\n\r\n(e). In 2014 we moved most of our Ammonia lines to the roof outside.\r\n\r\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates:  June 10, 1994 - June 10, 1999. On November 11, 1994 a reportable release occurred at the New Ulm Plant.  The release was caused by a barrel of cheese puncturing an ammonia liquid line to a cooling unit.  The puncture in the pipe resulted in a release of 700 lbs of amminia vapor over a 60 minute time interval.  The ammonia release occurred within the plant structure.  There were no injuries reported during the ammonia release.  There have been no reportable releases since that time at the New Ulm facility.                                                              \r\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, in Section 1.0, the New Ulm Plant has developed an emergency response program.  The emergency response program is comprised of three elements: emergency communications, emergency evacuation procedures and an off-site plan.  Separate documents, or plans, were produced to define the policies and procedures of the New Ulm Plant.  The plans were also written to identify to the plant employees what precautions and steps should be taken in the event of the release of a hazardous substance.  The combination of the three documents yields a comprehensive Emergency Response Program"

The New Ulm Fire Department shall be notified by the security personnel via 911.\r\n\r\nThe emergency evacuation procedures document is designed to provide an orderly, effective plan of action for protecting employees in emergency situations when an evacuation is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe off-site plan was written to identify the hazardous chemicals on-site (and the quantities), the primary emergency responders site diagrams, support available at/from the facility and a hazard analysis (off-site consequences and affected area, including receptors)."
