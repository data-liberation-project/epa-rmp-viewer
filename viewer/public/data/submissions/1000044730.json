The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\n\nChlorine\n\nLiquid chlorine is stored at the EMD Acquisition LLC facility in one ton cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a cylinder rupture and 2000 pounds of chlorine, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the chlorine cloud will travel approximately 1.3 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine alternative case scenario involves a leak in the line from the storage vessel to the first process vessel.  In this scenario, approximately 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the chlorine cloud will travel approximately 0.3 miles before the endpoint concentration (3 ppm) is met.      \n\n\n\nBoron Trichloride\n\nLiquid boron trichloride is stored at the EMD Acquisition LLC facility in cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a storage vessel failure and 5250 pounds of boron trichloride, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the boron trichloride cloud will travel approximately 0.25 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\n\n\nThe boron trichloride alternative case scenario involves a leak from the storage vessel.

Our compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered process are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\nWe conduct and certify compliance audits of the prevention programs for RMP-covered processes at least every three years.  We integrate these audits into PSM audits.  Our audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the  and complexity of the processes to be audited.  The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge: \n\n\n\n? Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (49 CFR Part 68)\n\n? Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n\n? Capability to document audit results\n\n? Knowledge of the process to be audited\n\n\n\nOur audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit.  They use a protocol that contains questions that systematically address each RMP rule requirement.  The team leader assigns each auditor sp"

At the conclusion of the audit, our audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nWe have a plant management committee that promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for corrective action implementation, and assigns a target completion date.  The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored until open issues are resolved.  We retain the most recent audit report.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that incidents with significant impacts are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nWe investigate all incidents (including near misses) that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a large uncontrolled release of a regulated substance, serious injuries to our employees or the public, and/or damage to the environment.  We train our employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur. If the incident meets RMP-classification criteria, we initiate an investigation within 48 hours.  We assemble an investigation team consisting of:\n\n\n\n? At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n\n? A contract worker if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract worker\n\n? Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event\n\n\n\nWe train our investigation team leaders in investigation techniques.

We review the incident investigation report and action plan items with employees (and contract worker, as appropriate) who work in the affected area and/or perform job tasks relevant to the investigation findings. We accomplish this review by routing a copy of the approved report to potentially affected employees (and contract worker and by discussing the event at the next safety meeting.  We retain incident reports for at least five years.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, our employee participation plan helps ensure that all employees have appropriate involvement in developing and implementing RMP.\n\n\n\nWe have a written employee participation program that meets RMP requirements.  In this document, we describe in detail the many different ways that employees participate in each element of the RMP regulations. We periodically update this document as changes occur.  We consult with the employees and their representatives on ways to improve participation in the RMP. \n\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, we use our hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252(a), are in place before hot work (work involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or similar flame or spark-producing operation) begins on or near an RMP-covered process.\n\n\n\nWe studied OSHA's fire prevention and protection regulation 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and developed a procedure t"

We have a detailed contractor safety program that applies to contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to an RMP-covered process. \n\n\n\nWe select contractors based on prior site work history and on information that they are required to provide as part of the qualification process.  The qualification information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience).  Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record are dropped from further consideration.
