Four process areas at the facility contain regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantities listed in Table 1 in Sec. 68.130.  Worst-case and alternative toxic release scenarios have been modeled for the four processes using TRACE (Toxic Release Analysis of Chemical Emissions) chemical release modeling software, a commercially available product from  SAFER Systems, LLC.  These areas and the release scenarios have not changed since the last filing.\n\nAll scenarios were modeled using Subpart B input requirements.  There are no regulated flammable substances at WSTF that are above the threshold quantity.\n\n2.0 WSTF DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND\n\nWSTF was established in 1962 to support certification of Apollo spacecraft propulsion and power systems and association subsystems for the Manned Space Center, now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC).  WSTF remains a facility operated under the direction of JSC.  The mission of WSTF is to provide the expertise and infrastructure to test and evaluate spacecraft materials, components, and propulsion systems to enable the safe human exploration and utilization of space.  Although a majority of the work of WSTF is in direct support of JSC programs, we also perform work for other NASA Centers, other Government entities, commercial customers, and foreign governments.\n\nThe facility is located 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, and 65 miles (105 km) north of El Paso, Texas.  This site was chosen for its isolated location and topography, which minimize the inherent hazards of aerospace propulsion testing to the general population.  Meteorological and geographical conditions"

      "SummaryText": "were emphasized in determining the location of the site as well as the anticipated hazards associated with each process.  The prevailing winds are southwesterly (i.e., flowing to the northeast) \u00c2\u00bf away from WSTF and population centers, affording conditions to protect employees and the public.  In the four decades that WSTF has been in operation, the city of Las Cruces and the surrounding areas have grown, but WSTF remains well away from large population bases.\n\nA security force that is on duty on a 24/7 basis controls access to the WSTF site.  Security guards control access to the industrial complex and also patrol the site boundaries.\n\n3.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWSTF is committed to providing a safe place of employment by meeting or exceeding applicable health and safety requirements to assure personnel, community, and environmental safety and preservation of resources.  The Management System Manual (MSM), Section 4.2.1.7, Safety emphasizes the concept that safety is the individual and personal responsibility of everyone at WSTF.   Imbedded within the management system are procedures for control of processes containing hazardous substances during the design, buildup, and test phases of programs, and emergency protocols to be followed in the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance.  The management system assures that WSTF is compliant with applicable State, Federal, and NASA regulations.\n\nThe primary accidental release prevention measures are provided in the WSTF Standard Instruction (WSI), Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (25-SW-0005).  WSI 25-SW-0005, written in compliance to 29 CFR (OSHA) 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, outlines the steps necessary to design, build, verify, and perform testing operations using highly hazardous chemicals as defined by the standard.  Included in the WSI are references to documents that control the training of personnel"

Additionally, hazardous testing is conducted only after careful evaluation of wind conditions and other meteorological parameters that can affect the test results and/or the potential release of  a hazardous chemical.\n\nWSTF Standard Procedure (WSP) 25-0009,WSTF Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP), is designed to manage activities to eliminate or reduce the probability of disaster, to prepare for measures to be taken which will preserve life and minimize damage to the facility and the environment, to respond appropriately during emergencies, and to establish a recovery system in order to return the facility to normal or improved operation following an emergency.  WSTF has chartered an EPP Board, whose principle responsibility is the continuous review and update of the plan, assuring its effective maintenance.\n\nWSTF recognizes the need for public awareness where hazardous chemicals are concerned.  Representatives from the site participate in the Dona Ana County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Representatives from the WSTF site brief the committee on what chemicals are located on site, what processes they are involved in, and what safety precautions are taken to ensure the safety of employees as well as the public.  The representatives report mishaps and releases in the LEPC annual report, if any occur.\n \n4.0 WSTF FACILITIES REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nSeveral hazardous chemicals are essential in testing propulsion systems at WSTF.  The EPA regulates two of these chemicals that WSTF possesses in an amount over the regulated threshold, the rocket propulsion fuels hydrazine and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH).  These fuels are used in several Space Shuttle and Space Station propulsion subsystems.  Hydrazine and MMH are stored in regulated quantiti"

The tanks are also protected by a remote-activated FIREX water deluge system.\n* Testing activities in the 300 and 400 Areas are controlled from hardened blockhouses that protect employees from potential explosions or toxic releases.  The blockhouses are designated as a safe haven for toxic releases.  The blockhouse monitors are stationed at the safety console during propellant operations so that activation of safety systems such as intercoms, sirens, and FIREX systems can be accomplished quickly.  The monitor can readily communicate with WSTF Fire Department personnel in the event of an accident during testing operations.\n\n5.1 WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\nAll four EPA-regulated processes were modeled to determine the one that had the greatest risk of exposure to public or environmental receptors.  It was found that the 400 Area MMH System posed the greatest risk of the four regulated processes and is the process that will be reported.

Three major types of credible releases were consistently given:  (1) a transportation handling accident resulting in the rupture of a propellant drum, (2) process piping failure/leak during transfer of MMH from an Ready Storage Unit (RSU) to one of the Test Stand Auxiliary Units (ACU), and (3) process piping failure during circulation of hydrazine at one of the Ready Storage Units (RSU's). \n\nUpon consideration of the credible releases, a shipping container mishandling scenario was selected for the 500 Area Propellant Storage area.  A process piping release scenario during transfer of propellant from an RSU to an ACU was selected for the 300 and 400 Area MMH systems and the 300 Area Hydrazine system.\n\nTwo scenarios were  modeled as a liquid stream released continuously at 70oF at ground level into a concrete substrate with a pool area of 900 square feet (transfer of hydrazine from the 300 HCU to Test Stand 303 and transfer of MMH from the 300 or 400 Area RSU to Test Stand ACU).   The shipping container mishandling scenario was modeled as a liquid stream released continuously at 70\u00c2\u00b0 F at ground level onto an unconfined area.  The meteorological conditions for all three alternative scenarios were the same.  The wind speed was chosen to be 15 mph, an ambient temperature of 75oF, a stability class of \"C\" (slightly unstable), and a humidity of 30 percent.

During a transfer operation from the fuel RSU to a Test Stand ACU, mechanical failure of a section of line downstream of the RSU and upstream of the ACU occurs.  The approximate flow rate for this operation is 50-60 gallons per minute.  The response by the technicians performing this manual operation was estimated to be within 30 seconds, but a conservative value of a 1-minute response was selected.  In this case, 50-60 gallons may be released plus the quantity of propellant in the 2-inch-diameter line.  Given a 50-foot section of line, the quantity released would be an additional 10 gallons (rounded up from 8.16 gallons), resulting in a total release of 60-70 gallon"
