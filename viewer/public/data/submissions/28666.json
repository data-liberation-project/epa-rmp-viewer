The CAA makes it clear that facilities that handle hazardous substances bear the primary responsibility for ensuring their safe use.  This statutory mandate required EPA to establish a list of regulated substances as well as propose elements of an accidental release prevention program.\n\nUnder the requirements of Section 112(r), stationary sources (facilities) must identify and assess their chemical hazards and implement certain activities that are designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases. Also, facilities must submit a risk management plan (RMP) that summarizes these activities, and the plans will be available to state and local governments, the public and other stakeholders. The hazard assessment data disclosed by facilities can be used by local emergency planning committees (LEPCs) and other local response agencies to improve community emergency response planning. Also, the information in the risk management plan gives citizens the opportunity to work with industry to reduce risks to the community from chemical accidents.\n\nThe final RMP rule spells out requirements for the following basic components of a risk management program that regulated facilities must implement:\n\n    A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and offsite impacts of "

      "SummaryText": " a regulated quantity of a RMP chemical.\n\nIf two contiguous properties must have RMP registration; and has already registered with EPA, the new registration will be a ?revision? to that facility?s initial registration.  The registration facility name is amended from Cavin Plant to ?Owensboro Municipal Utilities.?  EPA Facility Identifier 100000132732.\n\nA description of the regulated substances handled: The Elmer Smith Station / Cavin Plant is an electric power generation station and a water treatment facility.  Anhydrous ammonia (the threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds; the site has 300,000 pounds) chlorine (the threshold quantity is 2,500 pounds; the site has potentially 20,000 pounds) and are the only RMP regulated substances, at this stationary source, above the threshold quantity levels established by EPA. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, stored in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks, is used in the SCR and SNCR systems to reduce nitrous oxides emissions. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas at ambient temperature or pressure; it is, however, stored as a liquid under pressure.  The gas is less dense than air, but when liquid ammonia is released it may aerosolize and behave as a dense gas.  The effects of ammonia inhalation range from irritation to severe respiratory injuries to death.  Ammonia is self-alarming; its strong odor is noticeable at concentrations above 50 ppm; concentration that is immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 300 ppm.  In general, people will not remain in the presence of ammonia so that the primary threat is to people who are unable to flee.\n\nThe Cavin Plant uses chlorine to treat water for eventual potable usage in quantities requiring an RMP (under present EPA regulation).  This process is for the chlorination of drinking water supplies.  Chlorine is a dense, nonflammable greenish-yellow gas with a bleach-like odor.  It is corrosive and severely irritating to all tissue.  The chlorine reduces bacterial and algal growth. The water trea"

If an emergency were to occur, it is OMU?s policy to notify the Daviess County LEPC and respond to the emergency.  A site specific emergency plan has been developed to address emergencies.\n\nThe worst case scenario, Anhydrous Ammonia:  As required by EPA, the worst case scenario evaluates the failure of one of the 30,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a dense vapor cloud.  According to EPA's RMP* Comp (an EPA approved modeling program), the distance with EPA established concentrations of concern is approximately eight miles.  The eight mile radius includes an estimated residential population of 33,481 people, a recreational area, a school, and office or industrial areas.\n\nThe worst case scenario, Chlorine: As required by EPA, the worst case scenario evaluates the failure of the one ton chlorine container when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a dense vapor cloud.  According to EPA's RMP* Comp (an EPA approved modeling program), the distance with EPA established concentrations of concern is approximately 1.3 miles.  The 1.3 mile radius includes an estimated residential population of 1,634 people, a recreational area, a school, and office or industrial areas.\n\nFive-year accident history: The Cavin Plant has not had an accident in the past five years involving chlorine that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.
