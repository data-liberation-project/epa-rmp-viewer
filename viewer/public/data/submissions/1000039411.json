The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant located near Bairoil, Wyoming operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from wet natural gas.  As a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility.  The Bairoil OC CO2 Plant does use and store a regulated toxic substance above the EPA set threshold levels.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used and stored above the threshold levels.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the EPA?s Risk Management Program and are also subject to OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement PROGRAM 3 under EPA?s accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling process safety information to participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information create"

These programs are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each element of PSM and the accidental release prevention programs.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include plant safety meetings and safety training to promote both process and personal safety.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sake operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazard, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Up-to-date process safety information is maintained on an going basis.  The reference documents are readily available at the plant location.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter document.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating if"

This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  OSHA and the EPA recognize the analysis as an approved method for conducting PHA?s.  Plant PHA's are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to company's local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in responses to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant period"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Bairoil OC CO2 Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n\n\n1.Unit startup\n\n2.Normal operations\n\n3.Temporary operations\n\n4.Emergency shutdown\n\n5.Normal shutdown\n\n6.Initial startup of a new process\n\n\n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate be revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, Bairoil OC CO2 Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper or lower limits.  This information along with operating procedures is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operation, the Bairoil OC CO2 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties"
