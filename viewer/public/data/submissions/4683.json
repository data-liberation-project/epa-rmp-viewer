General accidental release and prevention policy of Ryan Foods.\n\nAt Ryan Foods processing facility we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant during our dairy\nproduct manufacturing process.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant\nalso makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to\nour workers, the surrounding community and the environment.  \nIt is our policy at Ryan Foods to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program\nby managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state\nregulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release\nof hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our plant\npersonnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices\nthat are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nRyan Foods, 100 East Chestnut Street, Murray, Kentucky, operates a refrigeration system\nutilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical refrigeration is a\nthermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to\nmaintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of\nevaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and\nexpansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle\nis a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent h"
