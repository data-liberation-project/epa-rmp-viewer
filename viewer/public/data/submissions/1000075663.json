WDGS has a moisture content of approximately 65% and can be sold directly as animal feed.  Alternatively, WDGS can be process further and dried into Dry Distillers Grain with Solubles (DDGS).  DDGS has a moisture content of approximately 12% and stored on-site in a storage barn prior to loading into trucks and railcars.  The resulting recycled water or Thin Stillage is reused within the process as make-up water with solubles.  Corn Oil is a liquid co-product extracted from the Thin Stillage as a fatty-acid feedstock or biodiesel feedstock.\r\n\r\nThe distillation process removes the ethanol from the beer, non-fermentable corn solids and water.  The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole stillage.  The resulting product is called wet distillers grain (WDG).  A small amount of WDG will be maintained as wet cake - having a moisture content of 65 - 70% -- and sold directly to customers as high-quality animal feed.  Storage of wet cake is very limited, on the north side of the Energy Center.  The majority of WDG will be dried to approximately 12% moisture.  The resulting product is called dried distillers grain (DDG), which can be stored for extended periods of time in the large barn at the east end of the property.

The Andersons Marathon Ethanol, LLC is subject to RMP requirements due to exceeding threshold quantities (TQ) above regulated TQ values for toxic substance Anhydrous Ammonia and flammable mixture Denaturant (Natural Gasoline).\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used to control pH in process and stored outside in a 18,000-gallon storage tank on the west side of the Fermenters.  Maximum capacity of the storage tank is 15,300 gallons (85%) Anhydrous Ammonia.  This toxic substance is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.

Of the 974,324 pounds of natural gasoline, 472,752 pounds are RMP reportable chemicals.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release - Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe most likely causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as represented by the alternative release scenario.  The most probable time for an exposure to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery truck to the storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are directly observed by the delivery truck driver.  Transfers of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the processing building occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances for the alternative scenario, the amount released would not be based on the total volume of both vessels.  Instead, it would be limited by the volume of the delivery truck.  The plumbing at the storage vessel receiving bulkhead has backflow preventers which would prevent the tank from emptying its contents if a transfer hose ruptured.  Therefore, the product that would be released would have to come from the delivery truck.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied by a tanker truck, which holds 20 tons (40,000 pounds) of product.  Product is transferred via rubber hoses to the storage tank at a rate of 1,000 pounds / minute.  The truck has an excess flow valve and the receiving system at the tank also has one.  Typically, a release would immediately trigger the excess flow valves to slam shut.  However, if the release was too slow to trigger the excess flow valve, it would continue to leak until the transfer system could be shut down.  Over the course of a ten-minute period, approximately 10,000 pounds (10 minutes x 1,000 pounds) of ammonia"

Deliveries are typically 9,000 gallons or 48,686 pounds of which 23,623 pounds are butane, 2,2-dimethyl propane, 2-methylbutane and pentane.  \r\n\r\nAll deliveries are made during business hours and are observed by the truck driver and facility personnel.

The bulk storage tank was built in 2006 under strict guidelines established by the ASME pressure vessel code.  The National Board Certificate for the tank is on file.

The passive mitigation systems in place include:\r\n\r\nBulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point between the delivery truck and the storage tank plumbing.  If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to shear off from the plumbing.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just inside the breakaway barrier, would"

The active mitigation systems in place include:\r\n\r\nExcess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\r\n\r\nBack check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing back to the transport tank from the storage tank.\r\n\r\nPressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\r\n\r\nAn emergency shutoff cord, located along the side of the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage tank, activates the emergency shutoff valves (snappy joes) on the discharge side of the ammonia pump.  This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring-loaded valve.\r\n\r\nAn ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a water hydrant to help knock down a vapor cloud.\r\n\r\nSpill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\r\nDelivery truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece"

The Andersons Marathon Ethanol, LLC facility operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 63 people.\r\n\r\nThe following operations are performed at this facility:  Grain Receiving and Storage, Grain Milling, Fermentation, Distilling, Dehydration and Evaporation, Decanter Separation, Wet and Dry Distillers Grain with Solubles (WDGS / DDGS) Drying, Wet and Dry Distillers Grain with Solubles Storage and Shipping, and Ethanol Storage and Shipping.  \r\n\r\nCorn is stored temporarily in concrete silos and steel bins prior to being fed to four Hammer Mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\r\n\r\nCorn is blended with water & enzymes and pumped into Fermenters for batch fermentation.  Fermentation final product results in a Beer Mash which is approximately 12% ethanol and 88% non-fermentable solids and water.  The Beer Mash product goes through a scrubbing process to removed residual volatile organics from fermentation, and then enters the distilling process.\r\n\r\nCO2 gas is a byproduct of fermentation and sent to a scrubbing process that reduces the amount of ethanol and HAPs released to the atmosphere.  A blend of water with an additive flows countercurrent to the gases and removes the ethanol and HAPs from the CO2 gas.  CO2 gases from the Scrubber system vents to atmosphere or a dry ice production facility adjacent to The Andersons Marathon Ethanol, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe distilling process separates components of the Beer Mash that results in 190-proof ethanol, non-fermentable solids and water.  The 190-proof ethanol is pumped to bulk storage prior to pumping into a dehydration process to remove the residual water, with the"
