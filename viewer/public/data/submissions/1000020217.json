Accidental Release prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Dallas, Inc. are committed to protecting people and the environment.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are available to control and mitigate the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Lewisville Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one chemical at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management regulations.  That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) .  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements, is 26,000 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSysco Dallas, Inc. has taken the following steps, as required by 40 CFR Part 68 (EPA's Risk Management Planning regulations).
