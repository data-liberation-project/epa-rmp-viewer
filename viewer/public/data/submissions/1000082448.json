Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\n\n\nThe Glendale Waste Water Treatment Plant is part of the Wastewater Operations Division of the City of Lakeland, Florida.  The City of Lakeland requires each facility to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training services.\n\n\n\n2.

The plant consists of disinfection, filtration, clarification, and aeration processes which treat wastewater for the City of Lakeland.\n\n\n\nThe Glendale Waste Water Treatment Plant adds chlorine to the filtered wastewater as a disinfection agent.  The chlorination process is located in an enclosed building, that includes a scrubber capable of filtering up to one ton, located on the southwest corner of the property, where liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to 16 one-ton containers.  Eight containers are always connected to the chlorination system with 4 online and 4 on standby.  Up to 8 one-ton containers may be stored nearby.  The total maximum chlorine inventory in the process is 32,000 lbs.  This exceeds the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n3.    Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Glendale Waste Water Treatment Plant has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program was established in 1997 for the chlorine process. The program includes written operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and employee training to ensure safe operation of the chlorine process.  The PSM Program receives ful"
