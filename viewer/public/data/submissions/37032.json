      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe City of San Angelo Treatment Plant provides treated water to residential, commercial and industrial customers of the City and surrounding areas.  Raw water is processed and disinfected with chlorine in the treatment process.  The Water Treatement Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 24,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton cylinders, which is above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Water Treatment Plant since operations began.  No accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history have occurred at the Plant.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe off-site consequences of potential accidental releases of chlorine at the Water Treatment Plant were assessed in accordance with requirements established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68.  The Environmental Protection Agency's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" was used to model a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for chlorine.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Water Treatment Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhereed to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nA hazard review has been conducted for the chlorine system and identified action items are expected to be completed by December 31, 2004.  When a major process change is made to the system, there are procedures in place to conduct a hazard review.  Otherwise, a hazard review is conducted every five years.\n\nWritten p"

      "SummaryText": "rocedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are also in place at the Water Treatment Plant.  Procedures are reviewed and updated periodically by plant personnel and whenever a major process change occurs.\n\nWater Treatment Plant operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation and operator demonstration of activities.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nA team of Plant personnel conducts a compliance audit of the facility operations and procedures once every three years and whenever a major process modification is made.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implementation of the recommendations.\n\nFacility personnel are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of off-site emergency response personnel occurs, the City of San Angelo Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating the emergency response effort, and notifying potentially affected areas in the surrounding community."
