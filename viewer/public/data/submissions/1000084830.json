Vantage Corn Processors (VCP) has operational control of a Corn Dry Mill and Cogeneration facility located at Columbus, NE, and is a covered facility under the rule because three processes at the facility contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  All three of the processes meet Program Level 3 criteria.  The actual components of the required RMP include:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tConduct a hazard assessment (release scenarios)\r\n\u00bf\tDevelop and implement an accident prevention program\r\n\u00bf\tDevelop and implement an emergency response program\r\n\u00bf\tDevelopment and implementation of a management system organizational structure\r\n\u00bf\tSubmittal of a RMP Plan\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release, and to minimize the consequences of any such release of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nAt VCP, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\r\n\u00bf\tA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\r\n\u00bf\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our accident prevention program\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of our emergency response program\r\n\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help"

Operations at the site include raw material receiving and storage, corn processing and co-product separation, product storage and shipping.  The primary products are ethanol and animal feed.  In our processes, we use two toxic chemicals and one flammable material stored in quantities greater than the EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limit.  The EPA has identified that toxic chemicals and flammable materials exceeding Threshold Quantities have the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  The three substances and quantities are identified below.\r\n\r\n\tToxics\tQuantity\tThreshold Quantity\r\n\t\t\t\r\n1.\tChlorine\t4,000 lbs.\r\n(2 - 2,000 lb. Cylinders)\t2,500 lbs.\r\n2.\tAmmonia (anhydrous)\t48,000 gal \r\n(210,000 lbs. @ 85% Admin. Control)\r\n(4 - 12,000 gal.

AST\r\n(1 - 500,000 gal )\r\n(2,795,000 lbs.)\t10,000 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nChlorine is used at the cooling towers.  Chlorine is drawn into the water stream from storage cylinders to keep a bacteria-free system.  Anhydrous ammonia can used for pH adjustment and as a nutrient in our dry mill ethanol plant, the tanks are currently out of service but remain available for service.  Anhydrous ammonia is also used in the cogeneration facility for the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system, which injects ammonia into the appropriate high temperature region of the furnace/boiler for conversion of NOx to N2 and H2O.  Natural gasoline is added to ethanol in a blend tank as a denaturant."

The Plans consolidate various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The Emergency Response Plans include written procedures to follow in the event of an incident.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the Platte County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \r\n\r\n7.0\t   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe following are improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\r\n\r\n-\tEvaluate the use of alternate sources of sulfur dioxide (dry/solid forms)\r\n-\tEvaluate placing administrative controls on the quantity of sulfur dioxide stored on-site\r\n-\tEvaluate the use of alternate chemicals to replace the use of chlorine in the cooling towers.\r\n-\tAlternative chemicals / methods have replaced anhydrous ammonia at the dry mill, however the tanks remain in place out of service.\r\n\r\nIn addition, recommended changes identified during Process Hazard Analysis will be implemented as necessary."

The probability of a release meeting these conditions is extremely small.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario at VCP's Columbus Facility is the rupture of the anhydrous ammonia outdoor aboveground storage tank and release of the entire contents (full tank = 68,000 lbs.).  The worst release would occur over a 10-minute period and the distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 4.7 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using the RMP*Comp program for Anhydrous Ammonia as well as Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009). There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public and environmental receptors in this WCS include:  residences, schools, public recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas, national or state parks / forests and officially designated wildlife refuges.  The population was estimated and public receptors were identified using The EPA TRI Facility Siting tool and U.S. Census Data utilizing Marplot 4.2.4.  Environmental receptors were identified using U.S. Geological Survey Quad Maps.  Additional information regarding the WCS is included in the Registration Data Elements.\r\n\r\nThe worse-case flammable release scenario at VCP's Columbus Facility would be a vapor cloud explosion of the natural gasoline following release of the entire tank contents (2,900,000 lbs.).  The consequence distance to an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch is 1.1 miles.  The distance was obtained using RMP*Comp.  There are no mitigation measures included in this scenario.

Alternate toxic release scenarios have been prepared and selected for chlorine and ammonia.  An alternate flammable scenario has been prepared for natural gasoline.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe selected ARS for chlorine is described below.  Chlorine could be released at the facility if a one-ton chlorine cylinder valve is sheared off.  The entire contents of the cylinder (2,000 lbs.) could be released at a rate of 63.4 lbs/sec.  The release would occur inside the chlorine building.  Liquid chlorine is released which flashes immediately to vapor.  The distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  Active mitigation in this scenario includes release sensors and alarms, vacuum system shutdown, the presence of unloading personnel, and on-site Emergency Management Team (ERT) personnel and equipment.  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-99-009).  Public receptors include residences and commercial / industrial areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the exposure distance.\r\n\r\nThe selected ARS for anhydrous ammonia is described below.  Anhydrous ammonia could be released when a pressure release valve malfunctions.  Anhydrous Ammonia is released at a rate of 288 lbs. per minute for 30 minutes (8,640 lb. release).  The distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.4 miles.  The exposure distance was obtained using the ALOHA 5.4.1 program for ammonia (anhydrous).  Detection equipment, alarm system, excess flow valves, and an on-site ERT help limit release duration.  Public receptors include residential areas.

Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect processes are all considered.  Through evaluation, the consequences of catastrophic releases can be prevented or minimized.\r\n\r\nVCP processes are currently in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The PSM Program addresses chemical accident prevention in a way that protects employees as well as the public, and the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.
