In the event of a significant release of propane that involve off site populations, these populations will be notified through the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the environmental, health and safety management systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement. Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n-\tCompliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically being evaluated for improvements.\n-\tAn ongoing dialogue with the local Fire Department will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops"

These high standards include:\n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n-\tOperating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found during regular audits of the facility.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Whitehall Yard does not operate under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. However, they do operate under the requirements of Program Level 2 in the RMP regulations. Analysis of the potential hazards of the process, training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents since operations began. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a propane release has occurred at the Whitehall Yard Facility within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nKiros and the contract operator have documented emergency response plans and procedures in place at the Whitehall Yard properties to respond to and safety mitigate any release or accident involving propane. Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by Kiros contract operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to Kiros headquarters. Operator personnel at the terminal are trained to the Hazardous Materials Operations l"
