This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ferndale Storage Terminal is located west of Ferndale, Washington along the Strait of Georgia waters. The Terminal serves as a storage facility for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane and butane) receiving and sending these products via railcar, truck, pipeline and ship. The Terminal is able to store enough of both propane and butane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Terminal. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance pr"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the EHOS program are documented in a written employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each program element. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address: chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific inventories; safety interlocks; suppression systems; vent and relief studies; and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the equipment specifications and operating procedures. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes so safety features in the process are"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Terminal uses a variety and combination of applicable methodologies to conduct PHAs. These PHAs address: facility siting; human factors; qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel; and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process: What-if; Checklist; Hazard and Operability (HAZOP); Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA); Fault Tree Analysis; or an appropriate equivalent methodology. PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Terminal has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes: \n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to atmosphere to prevent overpressure of the large storage vessels.\n\n\n\n2. Excess Flow Valves that automatically close to isolate loading connection failures.\n\n\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific "

There were no incidents that occurred during the past 5 years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Terminal maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Terminal facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Terminal has been coordinated with the Whatcom County Fire District No. 7. This coordination includes periodic emergency response drills and meetings with the Fire Departments personnel. The Terminal is staffed 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an i"
