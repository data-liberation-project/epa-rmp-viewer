This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ferndale Storage Terminal is located west of Ferndale, Washington along the Strait of Georgia waters. The Terminal serves as a storage facility for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (propane and butane) receiving and sending these products via railcar, truck, pipeline and ship. The Terminal is able to store enough of both propane and butane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Terminal. Because processes at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance pr"

The facility also reviews recent CSB reports to improve its lessons learned information and improve the PHA process. The Terminal will be looking at atmospheric releases and corrosion impacts as a result of recent reports.\r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) normal operations, (2) emergency shutdown, (3) normal shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All of this training is documented for each operator, including skills demonstration used to verify that the operator understood the training. Process maintenance personnel are trained in their respective duties"

There were no incidents that occurred during the past 5 years. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Terminal maintains a written Emergency Action Plan, which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Terminal facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Terminal has been coordinated with the Whatcom County Fire District No. 7. This coordination includes periodic emergency response drills and meetings with the Fire Departments personnel. The Terminal is staffed 24 hours a day and has around-the-clock communications capability with the Fire Department. This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an i"

These PHAs address: facility siting; human factors; qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls on personnel; and one or more of the following methodologies appropriate to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process: What-if; Checklist; Hazard and Operability (HAZOP); Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA); Fault Tree Analysis; or an appropriate equivalent methodology.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, and correcting identified deficiencies. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures provide that work is performed in a consistent manner and serve as basis for training.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance prior to selection of a contractor.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.
