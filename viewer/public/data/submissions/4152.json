Fort Benning is located in western \n\nGeorgia, along the Chattahoochee River, near Columbus, GA.  \n\nThe installation extends westward, into Alabama, south of \n\nPhenix City, Alabama. The installation is situated on \n\napproximately 180,000+ acres, which includes parts of \n\nMuscogee and Chattahoogee counties in Georgia and Russell \n\nCounty in Alabama. There are four main cantonment areas at \n\nthe installation: Main Post, Harmony Church, Kelley Hill, \n\nand Sand Hill.\n\n    The facility uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at \n\nits wastewater treatment plants and drinking water \n\ntreatment plant. The chlorine gas cylinders capacities are \n\neither 2,000 lbs. or 150 lbs. containers. The specific \n\namount stored at each is process is found with the program \n\nelements. Several of the swimming pools on post also use \n\nchlorine gas as a disinfectant. However, the amount of \n\nchlorine stored at each pool is well below the RMP 2,500 \n\nlb. threshold. 150 lb. Cylinders are delivered from the \n\ndrinking water treatment plants to the swimming pools on an \n\nas needed basis.\n\n    Fort Benning has not had any accidents involving \n\nchlorine gas that resulted in any offsite or on site \n\nimpacts in the past five years.  The worst cast distance to \n\nendpoint does not go beyond the boundaries of Fort Benning. \n\nMore information relating to worse case distances is \n\nincluded in the program. Also included in the program is \n\ninformation regarding the models used to obtain the worse \n\ncase distances.\n\n    In the event of a chlorine release, Fort Benning's \n\nwastewater treatment plants and water treatment plant \n\nemployees do not act as first responders. There is a \n\nwritten policy (with training) to inform Fort Benning Fire \n\nDepartment through the use of 911. Fort Benning has \n\narranged for the fire department to respond to emergencies \n\ninvolving chlo"

      "SummaryText": "rine.  Fort Benning's fire department is \n\nequipped to handle a release or other chlorine emergency to \n\nthe magnitude in which chlorine is stored. Fort Benning \n\ncomplies with all fire codes and all applicable state and \n\nfederal laws.\n\n    Fort Benning has reduced the amount of chlorine gas \n\nstored at Wastewater Treatment Plant #1 from 34,000 lbs. to \n\n12,000 lbs. Wastewater Treatment Plant #2 keeps 12,000 lbs. \n\nof chlorine on hand at all times. The drinking water \n\ntreatment plant has reduced the amount of chlorine gas \n\nstored from 74,700 lbs. to 50,000 lbs. This amount \n\nfluctuates due to the storage of 150 lbs. cylinders for \n\npost swimming pools. Fort Benning anticipates a reduction \n\nin the amount of chlorine stored at the drinking water \n\nplant after the close of swimming pool season.\n\n    New chlorine regulator systems have been installed in \n\nall three plants. The new chlorine regulators operate off \n\nof a vacuum system. If a line breaks or becomes dislodged \n\nfrom a chlorine cylinder then the system shuts down. The \n\nvacuum system prevents chlorine gas from escaping. All \n\nchlorine cylinders are inspected when they are delivered, \n\nplaced on line, and through out each shift.\n\nNew chlorine gas detection alarms with dial up \n\ncapabilities to emergency responders will be installed in \n\nthe plants during the summer of 1999. Wind direction \n\nindicators have been installed at all three plants. In the \n\nevent of a release the wind direction indicators will \n\nprovide valuable information for emergency responders."
