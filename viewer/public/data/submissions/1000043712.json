      "SummaryText": "1.0    Introduction\n\nThe Rohm and Haas Company Croydon Plant (Rohm and Haas Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining processes safely.  Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to incidents should they occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This summary provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Croydon Plant, and a discussion of our response to the EPAs Risk Management Program. \n\n\n\n2.0    General Facility Information\n\n\n\nThe Croydon Plant is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  The plant was built in 1969 and is part of a larger site, the Bristol Site originally built in 1909.  Today, the Bristol Site includes the Croydon plant, the polymers solvent based acrylic production plant, and corporate engineering group.  The Croydon Plant shares many of the services provided at the Bristol Site including a unified emergency response network.  Of the total site area of 800+ acres, only 250 acres are in actual use with the balance of the area utilized as open space accommodating a variety of plant and animal species.\n\n\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces over 100 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products.  These products are aqueous based acrylic emulsions which are used as coatings and binders.  Emulsion coating products are used in interior and exterior latex paint and traffic line formulations.  In addition, these products are found in floor polishes, adhesives, inks,cosmetics, coatings and binders for paper products,cement and concrete.  Because the products are water based, they are more environmentally friendly than solvent based coatings.\n\n\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces more than 350 million pounds of product annually.   The plant's pr"

The Bristol Site works closely with its Community Advisory Council (CAC) to identify community needs and concerns.\n\n\n\n3.0    EPA Risk Management Program\n\n\n\nIn a series of rules promulgated between 1994 and 1998, and updated in 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency established the Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act containing a list of toxic and flammable chemicals.  Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate a worst case and alternative case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.\n\n\n\n4.0    Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Croydon Plant uses three RMP toxic chemicals: \n\nAcrylonitrile monomer - Storage tank, railcar, and 4 reactors\n\nVinyl Acetate monomer - Drum storage only\n\nAqueous ammonia - storage tank and 4 reactors\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0    The Rohm and Haas Croydon Plant Accident Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps  \n\n\n\nCroydon Plant maintains a number of accident prevention programs in order to ensure safe operation of all processes.  The Croydon Plant complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the Plant follows corporate and plant-specific safety standards, (which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards), while also complying with EPA, DOT, and state requirements.   The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP toxic chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \n\n\n\n5.1     Employee Participation -  Employees are "

Employees participate in safety committees, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, management of change reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.   Employees make rounds once per shift to identify potential leaks or other safety hazards.   Employees use Dow Chemical electronic tools to communicate hazardous conditions to each other and management.\n\n\n\n5.2    Process Hazard Analysis - A process hazard analysis technique known as RC/PHA (Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis) is used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analysis and updated a minimum of every three years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.  These are designed to create several layers of protection, so that if one system fails other systems will maintain the process in a safe state.  These engineering and administrative controls help prevent releases of chemicals: \n\n\n\n    Redundant safety systems and instrumentation, particularly for tank level systems\n\n    Automatic shutdown devices that are triggered if critical safety equipment malfunctions\n\n    Secondary containment for storage tanks\n\n    Alarm systems and automatic shutdown devices for critical control parameters \n\n    Pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurization\n\n    Fire protection systems\n\n    Operator attendance of unloading operations\n\n    Permit system to control work in hazardous areas\n\n    Work preplanning and safety reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3    Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for all processes to ensure safe operation.

This Consolidated Emergency Response Plan is  coordinated with the Bucks (Pennsylvania) and Burlington County (New Jersey) Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC), Bristol Township, and Croydon Fire Company.  The site Emergency Services Leader serves on the Bucks County LEPC as an industry representative.   New employees are trained on handling emergencies prior to working in a process area and plant personnel review the plan annually.  The Bristol Facility has an extensive alarm system, which is monitored by ADT.   The facility has emergency service technicians on site at all times.   ADT will call the emergency service technician or the fire department depending on the type of alarm.   The facility has an on-site fire brigade, mobile fire suppression vehicles, Hazmat Technicians as well as certified emergency medical personnel. The site has mobile foam capabilities to control vapor release.  All emergency response personnel receive ongoing training.  The facility has 24-hour emergency response capabilities and can respond to both on-site and transportation off-site hazardous materials releases.
