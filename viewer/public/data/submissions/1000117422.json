This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \nThe Falcon plant is a facility which receives field natural gas from third-party producers.  The field natural gas is treated to remove impurities and further processed to produce condensate, natural gas liquids and residue gas for sale to customers.  These sales products are flammable mixtures which can contain regulated flammable substances including methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed their respective threshold quantities stored at this facility.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nThis facility is regulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals - PSM), 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), and 40 CFR Part 68 (EPA Risk Management Program) as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are in place to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. \n\nThis facility has implemented the PSM elements to facilitate accidental release prevention.  Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.  Process hazard analysis"

Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.   \n\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.    \n\nThe facility has a policy of investigating accidental releases to prevent similar accidents from recurring.  The facility has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.   \n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThis plant does not have any incidents within the last 5-years that would meet this criteria: \u0093accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\u0094\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThis facility is a non-responding facility and has coordinated with the local fire department for response to large, non-incipient stage, accidental releases.  The facility maintains an emergency action plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify"

Improvements are accomplished through responsibility matrices and training, which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."
