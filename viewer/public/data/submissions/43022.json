It\u00bfs designed to provide the Fresno County CUPA with necessary details required for review. The original program was filed and approved in 1999. \n\nThere were no changes in refrigeration equipment, inventory or releases in the last 5 years. The only changes at the facility was the addition of NH3 monitoring and retirement of the Packing Shed Manager. \n\nRegulation changes in 2004 require the following revisions; \n\u00bf\t5 year Accident History must be updated within 6 months if a reportable release occurs. Originally it was only every 5 years.\n\u00bf\tERP Emergency Contact information changes must be updated in 30 days. This can be done online for EPA and must be mailed to the County. \n\u00bf\tAdditional data sections of RMP consultant information and ERC email address were added.\n\nA Compliance Audit was completed to document previous undocumented reviews by facility staff. Suggestions from the Compliance Audit will be followed and implemented, or rejected and any suggestions documented in the follow-up section. The major recommendation was more complete documentation of inspections, training, contractor qualifications and employee awareness.\n\nThe original Process Hazards Analysis was reviewed as required at 5 years. Since Royal Valley Fruit Growers did an excellent job of implementing recommendations in the original PHA, and since no equipment changes have occurred since the last PHA, no revisions were required to update the original PHA. The most significant item was considering a component reliability program for SRV\u00bfs instead of replacing all SRV\u00bfs every 5 years. There are 28 SRV locations. All but 3 of these are dual SRV\u00bfs for a total of 53 SRV\u00bfs. One SRV that\u00bfs been in service will be removed and sent for testing yearly. This process of testing would naturally replace all active valves ever"

This facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public or included in the Executive Summary.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRoyal Valley Fruit Growers Association is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our use of Industrial Refrigeration Contractors for all maintenance including remote system monitoring in addition to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls and perform preventative maintenance to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nStationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities are consistent with SIC code 0723. Specific activities include washing, packing, pre-cooling and cold storage of grapes and tree fruit.  The flooded Ammonia refrigeration system provides 3 pre-coolers, 3 storage rooms 1 refrigerated hallway/dock and a hydro-cooler.  Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigerant is the only regulated substance present at our facility above thresholds requiring an RMP.  Total system NH3 capacity is estimated at 17,700 lbs..  Sulphur Dioxide seasonally used for fumigation is also present however quantities are under 300 lbs.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required off"

No specific unusual external events were included due to the facilities rural location, remote equipment location and recent construction meeting all applicable seismic and safety codes. A pipe/tank rupture in the largest vessel was used to represent the Worst Case. Potential impacts by forklift or other facility traffic typical to this type of operation or errors made during maintenance/construction are the most likely cause of a reportable release. Any catastrophic earthquake, fire or weather type events would result in the same impacts as presented in this OCA or less. Details are not included in the executive summary to prevent potential abuse of public information.\n\nSince no accidents or near - misses occurred, a common compressor shaft seal failure was used for the alternate release scenario. This is a realistic release that is expected to happen at least once over the life of the system. To simulate it a seal or flange leak of \u00bc\u00bf diameter gas release is assumed. The release rate is 10 lbs/minute at a pressure of 154 psig corresponding to 86\u00b0F condensing pressure. A response time of 30 minutes is assumed. Plant maintenance personnel could respond more quickly in most cases. The distance of <0.1 miles is obtained from RMP Comp software corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Using tables which have values less than .1 miles it\u00bfs actually less than .06 miles. \nFive-year Accident History\nRoyal Valley Fruit Growers Association has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no reportable accidental releases or injuries during this period.\nProgram 3 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes. A complete review and revision of Standard Operating Procedures was completed 4/20/2005.\n\nTraining\nRoyal Valley Fruit Growers Association has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The last complete Mechanical Integrity survey was 10/04/2004.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Royal Valley Fruit Growers Association to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 10/22/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Royal Valley Fruit Growers Association.  The most recent review was performed on 04/01/1999.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRoyal Valley Fruit Growers Association conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
