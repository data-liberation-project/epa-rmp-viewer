Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIn this facility we use Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, and toluene 2,6-diisocyanate in amounts which are cosidered hazardous by the EPA. We observe safety precautions in handling these materials sufficient to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personnel health as well as our co-workers and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhear to all applicable State and Federal rules and regulations.\n\nOur emergency reponse program is based on information provided to us by our suppliers of these regulated materials. The emergency response plan is coordinated with the Senatobia Fire Department and Chemtrec, in whom we have entered into agreement with htem to be our primary responder in the event of accidental hazardous material release.The emergeny response plan procedures for the notification of these agencies as well the local Emergency Planning Committee in the event of an accidental release.                                                                                                                                                    \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of residential dinette furniture and contract office seating. Toluene 2,4 and 2,6-diisonate are used in the molded foam manufacturing process for our seating. The 2,4 and 2,6 TDI mixture is stored in 6,000 gallon closed tank located inside the plant in the foam building section. Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substances used at this facility are Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate and Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate.\n\nThe "

Administrated controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternative release scenario, including;\n\nToluene 2,4-diisocyanate;\nWorst-Case Scenario-Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of 43,555 lbs. of Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate.The release would be into a diked area of 918 square feet and a building floor area of 854 square feet. The release rate to the outside air would be less than .0008 lbs. per minute making the estimated distance to toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nToluene 2,6-diisocyanate;\nWorst-Case Scenario-Failure of the TDI storage tank would result in a release of 10889 lbs. of Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate.

The release rate to the outside air would be less than .00231 lbs. per minute making the estimated distance to toxic endpoint of .01 miles.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations. The processes using the regulated materials have been designed using all applicable federal and industry standards including the SPI's Safety Guidelines for working with TDI.\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\n\nWe have had no accidental release of any of the materials in the last 5 years.\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is based upon emergency response and specific chemical information provided by supplier of the TDI mixture. We have contacted the services of Ferguson Harbour Incorporated to be the primary responder to any accidental hazardous material release. FHI will provide emergency response "
