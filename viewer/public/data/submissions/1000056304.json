These policies have been incorporated in the facility's Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nThere are three flammable substances at the NorthStar facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68. These substances are used as propellants in packaging operations at the facility. These substances and the specific process covered include:\n\n\n\n* Toxic Substances\n\n\n\n-- There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities per 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\n* Flammable Substances\n\n\n\n-- Flammable Mixture: This material, which is a mixture of propane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether, is a propellant added during packaging operations in the adehesive preparation process. The maximum amount of flammable mixture stored on-site is approximately 51,100 pounds. \n\n\n\n-- Methyl ether: This material is used in similar fashion as the flammable mixture. The maximum amount of methyl ether stored on-site is approximately 10,350 pounds.\n\n \n\n-- Flammable Mixture: This material, which is a mixture of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and dimethyl ether, is a propellant added during packaging operations in the adehesive preparation process. The maximum amount of flammable mixture stored on-site is approximately 7,200 pounds. \n\n\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed. \n\n\n\nThe Adhesive Preparation Process prevention program includes the following process controls and mitigation systems:\n\n\n\n*Relief and check valves\n\n*Manual and automatic shutoffs\n\n*Interlocks\n\n*Alarms and procedures\n\n*Emergency power\n\n*Grounding equipment\n\n*Excess flow dev"

The ERP is to be coordinated with the Bartow County Fire Department and the Bartow County Emergency Management Agency. As part of the community involvement efforts, the following activities may be coordinated with the agencies listed above:\n\n\n\n*Pre-emergency tours\n\n*Emergency action drills\n\n*Hands-on fire extinguisher training\n\n*Material safety data sheets\n\n*Responsibility roles in evacuation procedures\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility has a plant emergency notification system.\n\n\n\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed.  During the past five years, there have been no RMP reportable accidental releases.\n\n"
