The refrigeration system has an inventory of ammonia that is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make this chemical valuable as a refrigerant also make it necessary to observe specific safety precautions.  These safety precautions are exercised in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system to control human environmental exposure in an effort to reduce the overall threat to workers as well as the surrounding communities and the environment.\n\nIt is Arden's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  However, the safe handling of ammonia is paramount at Arden.  Standards and recommended practices governing the safe handling of ammonia are used to ensure that a reasonable level of risk reduction is maintained.  Investigation of inherently safer technologies, and failsafe design applications are a few of the continuous improvements being studied.  Safety depends upon management commitment, the manner in which ammonia refrigerant is handled, the safety devices inherent to the refrigeration system design, operating procedures and philosophies, and the training of Arden workers.\n\nArden believes that accountability for safety reaches throughout all levels of management.  Senior management's commitment and dedication to continued safe-operating practices is clearly evident in Arden?s organization structure and employee empowerment.  \n\nExtensive improvements have been made to safety and health programs like the "

This is known as employee ownership and its success is portrayed through lower injury rates, fewer incidents, and improved efficiencies at the plant.\n\nThe Emergency Evacuation Plan outlines procedures for warned and unwarned emergencies that may occur at the plant.  Warned emergencies are usually tornadoes, heavy snowstorms, or conditions that are reasonably predictable.  Unwarned emergencies usually consist of onsite emergencies such as a spill, fire/explosion, or a chemical release.  As a responsible company, Arden coordinates emergency response activities with the local emergency management organizations.  This ensures prompt response and mitigation actions during incidents.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled\n\nArden International is a domestic producer of processed food products.  The Lakeville, Minnesota plant site covers approximately 88,400 square feet and the facility grounds total 18.28 acres within the Lakeville City limits.  It is located at 21150 Hamburg Avenue in Lakeville, Minnesota, Dakota County.\n\nThere are approximately 100 employees at the plant site at any one time. \n\nOnly one chemical covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is inventoried at the Lakeville site.  This substance is present in quantities greater than the threshold quantity identified by the RMP regulation and therefore is included in our risk management program.\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) - Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the plant.  It is received into the plant by truck, however deliveries of ammonia are infrequent.  One of the primary refrigeration vessels is the Low Pressure Receiver vessel. This vessel has a maximum inventory of 10,582 pounds that is controlled through administrative procedures.  The refrigeration system at the facility has a total capacity of approxima"

This prevention program was designed around mechanical integrity and training aspects.  The primary objective of the prevention program is to ensure complete containment of ammonia through safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\nArden completed a revalidation of its process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia refrigeration system in March 2009.  The recommendations generated during this review were prioritized using a standardized Risk Rank Matrix method and resolution will be in a timely fashion.\n\nFive year accident history\n\nArden has a very comprehensive Incident Reporting and Investigation procedural process.  This process is defined and explained in the prevention program procedures.  Basically, an incident occurs when a deviation from expected performance is experienced.\n\nIndividuals knowledgeable in refrigeration operation or the equipment being investigated lead formal incident investigations.  Root cause and corrective actions are determined and formal reports are prepared.  Progress regarding corrective action on all investigated incidents is tracked through final resolution.\n\nArden has not had an accidental release of ammonia within the past five years that resulted in an onsite injury or adversely affected the community.\n\n\nEmergency response Program\n\nArden?s emergency evacuation plan has been designed to address likely incidents arising from our ammonia refrigeration system.  The emergency plan is a vital part of Arden?s overall prevention program.

One of the primary aspects of the risk management program is the empowerment of each employee with the responsibility for continuous safe operations.  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration employs a programmable logic controller as a means to control ammonia emissions and inadvertent ammonia releases to the atmosphere.  An audio, visual, olfactory leak detection and repair program that requires multiple checks per day will control refrigeration system emissions.  In addition, ammonia detectors are strategically located throughout the machine rooms to quickly detect any releases."
