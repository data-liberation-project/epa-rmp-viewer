All procedures associated with 40 CRF 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which will assist in employee safety, public health associated with chlorine, and coordinate with response agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Walter D. Williams Jr. Water Filter Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water withdrawn from West Point Reservoir. Finish water from this plant serves the City of LaGrange, surrounding areas of Troup County, and also supplies the City of Greenville in Meriweather County as a wholesale customer. The chlorination process includes (liquid) chlorine cylinders, chlorine feed equipment, electrical and chemical control equipment, and safety equipment associated with this process. \r\n\r\nDue to the presents of a chlorination process, accidental release modeling was conducted for the impacted area in order to determine potential consequences associated with process failures, which would result in accidental release of chlorine. The first model  worst case  scenario, as defined by EPA, states  The owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. An incident history review was conducted at the Walter D. Williams Jr. Water Filter Plant, which assisted in identifying the most likely release scenario.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to a theoretical toxic end point. This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as  the maximium airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individua"
