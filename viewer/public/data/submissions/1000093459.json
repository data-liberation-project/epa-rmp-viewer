To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Kenneth O. Lester Company is continuing to implement a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program\n\n\n\n Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP.  Kenneth O. Lester Company has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Kenneth O. Lester Company conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nKenneth O.
