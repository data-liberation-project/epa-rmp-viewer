VTCC personnel work continuously to identify methods to reduce the use of hazardous materials and to reduce the risk to the community and environment through implementation of new technology and procedures.  This commitment to safe and environmentally sound operations are values Vopak holds at its core.  They are documented in policy and compliance manuals, and in the mission statement, which are available to all employees.  \t\r\n2.1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n2.1.2.1\tC4 Spheres\r\nThere are two interconnected C4 spheres.  The operating conditions for these spheres are 30 psig \r\nand 80 \u00b0F. Each C4 sphere can contain 179,655 ft3 (6,778,112 lb) of C4-mixture.  Per Vopak, the maximum inventory at any given time is one sphere completely full and the second sphere within its 75% capacity.  Therefore, the maximum expected inventory of C4 mixture at the VTCC facility is 11,903,480 lb.  There are no C4 mixture chemical processes involved at the VTCC facility as no chemicals are produced or consumed at the facility.\r\n\r\n2.1.2.2\tPygas Tanks\r\nThere are three interconnected pygas tanks.  These tanks are at atmospheric conditions.  \r\nTanks TK-120-01 and TK-120-02 have a nominal capacity of 179,674 ft3 (9,128,284 lb) of pygas mixture.  Tank TK-130-01 has a nominal capacity of 4,022 ft3 (204,312 lb).  Per Vopak, the maximum inventory at any given time is TK-120-01 and TK-130-01 completely full and TK-120-02 within its 75% capacity.  Therefore, the maximum expected inventory of pygas mixture at the VTCC facility is 16,178,808 lb.

Vopak conducts training in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.1200, the Hazard Communication standard, to help employees to be more knowledgeable about the chemicals they work with as well as familiarize them with reading and understanding SDS's.  Careful consideration is given to assure that employees including maintenance and contract employees receive current and updated training. \r\n\r\nVopak ensures that each employee presently involved in operating a process or a newly assigned process is trained in an overview of the process and in its operating procedures. Employees already involved in operating a process on the PSM effective date do not necessarily need to be given initial training. Instead, Vopak may certify in writing that the employees have the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities specified in the operating procedures.   Refresher training is provided at least every three years, or more often if necessary, to each employee involved in operating a process to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures of the process.  Vopak determines whether each employee operating a process has received and understood the training required by PSM. A record is kept containing the identity of the employee, the date of training, and how the employer verified that the employee understood the training. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI) is to ensure equipment does not fail in a way that causes a release of chemicals.

The first is to assess whether the management system in place adequately addresses all elements of the PSM rule. The second objective is to assess whether the management system has been adequately implemented for every facility or process.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nUnder the incident investigation section of PSM, the VTCC  has committed to perform a complete investigation of incidents to determine their causes and to seek ways of preventing their recurrence.  The process of incident investigation utilizes a team-based approach involving: gathering and analyzing the evidence; drawing conclusions as to the causes of the incident; generating corrective or preventive actions; and summarizing, documenting, and disseminating the findings. Proper documentation of incident investigation results  provides the basis for corrective actions leading to improvements in the organization's process safety management (PSM) program, and accordingly, should enhance terminal safety.\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\nA Hot Work Permit is required for any operation involving open flames or producing heat and/or sparks. It includes brazing, torch cutting, grinding, soldering, welding and others. The purpose of this element is to assure that VTCC and all affected personnel are aware of the hot work being performed and that appropriate safety precautions have been taken prior to beginning the work.  VTCC has set up a permitting process that requires the date authorized for hot work, equipment involved in the work, a system to maintain and document certification, identification of openings where sparks may drop, the types and number of fire extinguishers, identification of fire watches, an inspection before the work, authorization signatures, identification of flammable materials in the area, verification that the surrounding area is not explosive, verification that combustibl"

For contractors, whose safety performance on the job is not known, VTCC is committed to obtaining information on injury and illness rates and experience.  VTCC screens to ensure that the contractor has the appropriate job skills, knowledge, and certifications. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nSafe operation and maintenance requires the involvement of both the employers and the employees. VTCC employees are expected and instructed to participate in all the major elements of the Process Safety Management program. Employees have the opportunity to actively participate through consultation using methods such as anonymous communication and employee representation. \r\n\r\nInput from employees with the understanding of the processes are continuously solicited as a source of information in the development of process incident prevention plans and conducting Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), or when conducting incident investigations, audits or other activities.
