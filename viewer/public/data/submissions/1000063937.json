This is sufficient to contain the release of this amount of chlorine without causing a building failure due to pressure. The mitigating factor of the building is not considered in computing the release rate to the atmosphere for either scenario. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario assumes a one-ton cylinder fails and discharges 2000 pounds of chlorine gas in ten minutes. This results in a discharge rate of 200 pounds per minute to the atmosphere. No active or passive factors are assumed to mitigate this release. The EPA CEPP RMP Guidance, dtd October 1998 (RMP Guidance), determines a footprint with a radius of 1.3 miles around the plant is the area affected by this release. The area has a population of 5200 and public receptors of residences and schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario assumes the fusible plug metal blows out on a one ton cylinder filled to capacity. This causes chlorine gas to escape through a 3/8-inch hole. This scenario creates the greatest release of gas to the atmosphere. Using the RMP Guidance, the release rate is 37 pounds per minute with the radius of 0.1 miles around the plant as the footprint of the area affected. This footprint does not affect any public or environmental receptors.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\r\n\r\nOur emergency planning and response program addresses the actions that our employees are to take in the event of an unwanted release of a highly hazardous chemical at our facility.
