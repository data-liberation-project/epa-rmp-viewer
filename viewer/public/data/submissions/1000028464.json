This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City Utilities Department implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work safely and efficiently and provide immediate corrective response to any accidents.\n\nThe Lake Hefner WTP staff are trained to respond in the event of a chemical release incident. Emergency response to accidental releases is also coordinated with the Oklahoma City Police and Fire Departments and State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Lake Hefner WTP utilizes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (regulated substances) as disinfectants in the drinking water treatment process.\n\nChemical Name\n\nStationary Source\n\nMaximum Inventory\n\nChlorine\n\n24, 1-ton containers (8 containers online in the chlorine drum room and 16 containers stored on the loading/unloading dock)\n\n48,000 pounds\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\n4,000 gallons (2, 2,000 gallon tanks)\n\n20,600 pounds\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis as well as written process"

Process safety information includes chlorine and anhydrous ammonia information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\n\nThe City of Oklahoma City Utilities Engineering Division verifies that City owned water and wastewater treatment plants comply with applicable codes and standards and with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (through review of engineering standards for construction projects).\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis completed for this RMP documents the process and the findings to minimize or eliminate hazards, to mitigate the consequences of hazards of any releases or other unplanned events, and to reduce the likelihood of exposure to chlorine or anhydrous ammonia.\n\nWritten procedures and information have been developed, implemented, and maintained for each hazardous process, including steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\n\nAll employees involved in working with and around the chlorine and anhydrous ammonia systems are trained in process and safety procedures, including emergency response on an annual basis.\n\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine or anhydrous ammonia systems."
