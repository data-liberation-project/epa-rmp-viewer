The District is committed to providing Georgetown County employees a safe working environment.  To ensure this environment, the District has establish safe working practices, standard operating procedures, and accident prevention programs.  Management is dedicated to training employees on proper operating procedures, emergency response, and equipment use.  To prevent accidental releases of chemicals, the District follows all applicable sections of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program.  Georgetown County Water and Sewer District has addressed the need for evacuation and response due to a chlorine release by coordinating with Local Fire Department's Emergency Response Team, and maintaining its own emergency response team for support, to respond and control spills or leaks of chlorine. The distances determined through the release scenarios determined the emergency response plan requirements.\r\n\r\n2.  The Murrells Inlet Wastewater Treatment Plant treats domestic and industrial wastewater from the surrounding area.  The plant consist of a bar screen, two oxidation ditches, two clarifiers, a chlorine contact chamber, dechlorination chamber and a post-aeration/effluent pump station.  The chlorination system, installed at the plant to disinfect the effluent flow before discharging the treated wastewater, is housed in a control building where the chlorinators, safety equipment and instrumentation are located.  The plant is equipped to use chlorine from one-ton containers under normal operation.  The chlorine is fed as a gas from one-ton containers to a chlorinator which mixes the gas with a stream of water.  The resultant chlorine solution is fed to a mixing chamber adjacent to the chlorine contact tanks.   The Murrells Inlet wastewater Treatment Plant typically has 3 one-ton co"

For the Process Hazard Analysis, two release scenarios, a \"worst-case release\" and \"alternate release scenario\", were evaluated for impact on the plant and its surroundings.  The worst-case release, as defined by EPA, is the \"greater of the following: (1) For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or (2) For substances in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe is released as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  The alternative scenario is one \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"  The worst-case scenario for the Murrells Inlet Wastewater Treatment Plant evaluated the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine as a gas within a ten-minute time span.  The release was modeled using the EPA modeling tool, RMP*Comp to determine the distance to toxic endpoint.  The distance to toxic endpoint is the distance the vapor cloud will travel before the maximum airborne concentration reaches a level that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one-hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects.  For the chlorine system at the wastewater treatment plant, the release of one ton container (2000 pounds) would travel 3.0 miles before reaching its toxic endpoint.  This distance accounts for the EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec, highest maximum daily temperature of 116 degreesF and average humidity of 65%.  Approximately 2,000 people, schools, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas would be affected.  The Intracoastal Waterway is an environmental receptors for the worst-case spill.  The alternative release scenario involves a vapor release from a tubing"

Approximately 700 people, a school, and a recreational area would be affected.  No passive mitigation has been considered at the wastewater treatment plant.  The installation of chlorine detectors and alarms in conjunction with a trained emergency response team have prepared the Georgetown County Water and Sewer District for a chemical release.  In the event of a release the response team can evaluate and contain the situation.  The District has on-site Chlorine Institute Emergency Repair Kits for the chlorine containers to aid the team in controlling the release.\r\n \r\n4.  The Georgetown County Water And Sewer District follows the EPA guidelines for Risk Management and the guidelines established by OSHA for Process Safety Management.  The two codes require the District to evaluate the on and off site risks associated with a highly hazardous chemical and ensure that proper precautions and plans are implemented to minimize the impact of such release.  The District completed a Process Hazard Analysis to review the causes and effects of a chemical release.  To aid in the prevention of a leak, the District has established a preventative maintenance program to keep the chlorine equipment in optimum condition.  Any equipment not in proper working order is immediately evaluated for repair or replacement.  In addition to a preventative maintenance program, the District has established standard operating procedures in conjunction with the Chlorine Institute and manufacturer's recommendations.  Employees are required to follow the standard procedures at the plant, especially near a highly hazardous chemical area.  All employees are trained prior to exposure to equipment"
