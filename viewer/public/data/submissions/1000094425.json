The policy mandates ANSI CGA G-2.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia for the ammonia storage. This standard closely resembles the required regulation under OSHA 1910.111. Company policy also requires the implementation of specific engineering and administrative controls to prevent releases for all toxics stored at this facility, in addition to a complete Safety & Health Program. Airgas Specialty Products does not respond to releases but maintains an Emergency Action Plan that is coordinated with local responders.\r\nIf a release were to occur at this location, associates would be notified of the release by activation of the audible alarm and muster at the evacuation point for a head count and notify the Baytown Fire Department if necessary.  The Baytown Fire Department is the primary response agency to a release at this location and is trained in Hazardous Materials operations.  \r\nAnhydrous hydrogen chloride, anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia at a concentration greater than 20% are stored and distributed from this location. Ammonia is stored in ASME coded pressure vessels and maintained in totally enclosed systems from transport cargo trailers to distribution vessels, minimizing transfer losses and accidental release potential. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored at this facility in DOT regulated tube trailers. The toxic and corrosive characteristics of anhydrous hydrogen chloride make it necessary to observe certain precautions when handling.\r\nAirgas Specialty Products has developed and implemented procedures specific to storage and distribution of all toxic chemicals at this facility to meet the requirements of a prevention program as outlined in the regulation. Process safety information was gathered specific to the process and a process hazard analysis was conducted and operating procedures were written based upon the process safety information"

All other elements of the prevention program has been addressed and followed per the RMP and PSM regulations.\r\nThis Airgas Specialty Products location has not had any RMP defined accidental releases in the past five years.\r\nAirgas Specialty Products has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia. The plan includes procedures for informing all on-site personnel as well as the required notification of emergency response personnel (local fire department, state and federal agencies).\r\nThis ASP facility has been scrutinized and closely follows the standards and regulations and has continued such without major incident or release for many years indicating sound processes and safety systems, therefore no engineering or administrative controls are scheduled to be implemented toward the improvement of safety."
