To further strengthen our prevention program we apply various elements of these standards universally throughout our plant site.  As a supplement to these requirements, the organics process utuilizes a PLC for continuous computer monitoring, activation of early warning alarms for early detection of out of normal range conditions and lastely activation of  interlocks to place the process or equipment is safe mode.  Where identified as critical redundant instrumentation exists to avoid false alarms causedby instrument failure.  The plant flammable vessels are equipped with automatic sprinkler systems that can be manually activated to function as a water currtain and deluge.  Our operating procedures have been reviewed by Underwriters Laboratories and have received certification in accordance with ISO 9002 standards.",

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Kemira Chemicals Inc.\nPlant: Washougal, WA\n\nKemira Chemicals Inc. is a chemical manufacturing company based in Kennesaw, GA.  We produce products for several diverse industries including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment and agricultural pest control. \n\nThe Washougal, Washington facility manufactures products for paper, water treatment and agricultural markets. The portion of the plant covered by Risk Management, makes two dithiocarbamate products that are sold to other chemical companies for use in agricultural pest control and for use in wastewater treatment. While the Washougal facility is 13 years old, the Organics Unit producing these dithiocarbamates is 6 years old. From initial concept, the design of the Organics Unit included product, process and employee safety considerations. OSHA regulations (Process Safety Management) required that several Layers of Protection be included during design, before startup and to continue through operations and training of all employees. These Layers of Protection are now parts and obligations of our Risk Management Programs.\n\nThe Organics Unit uses three raw materials that are covered under Risk Management:  carbon disulfide, methylamine and dimethylamine. EPA lists carbon disulfide as a Toxic; the two anhydrous amines are listed as flammables. \n\nCarbon disulfide:\n    Clear, colorless liquid with a garlic-like odor\n    Flammable in liquid and vapor form\n    Direct contact to skin and eyes will cause irritation. \n    Liquid contact to eyes can result in severe pain. \n    Inhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n    Prolonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nMethylamine\n    Clear, colorless, flammable gas with a fishy odor. \n    Slightly heavier than air\n    Contact with the eyes can result in severe pain and irritation. \n    Contact with the skin can cause burns or blistering.\n    Inhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n    Prolong"

The design of storage and handling systems take both hazards of each material into consideration. All materials handling, from rail car unloading, through storage, reaction, storage and loading of finished product into shipping containers, is a closed loop during normal operating conditions. Venting, when required, is routed through scrubbers designed to minimize emissions to the atmosphere. \n\nIn the production of dithiocarbamates, reactions between a specific amine and carbon disulfide will yield a specific dithiocarbamate. The Organics Unit uses two amines to produce two distinct dithiocarbamates. The reaction systems (as well as loading and unloading systems) are computer controlled and monitored by trained operators. Interlocks in the computer logic, for example, will not allow a rail car of amine to be unloaded unless all valves are in the proper position and that all safety observations and checks are properly processed.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis: \nWorst Case Scenario - Toxic Chemical -  Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario (Toxic) to be the sudden and complete loss of a full tank (350,000 pounds) of carbon disulfide. The only safety precautions that Risk Management allows to be considered in the Worst Case Scenario are passive mitigation. In our case, the storage tank is surrounded by concrete dike containment.

Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate evaporated carbon disulfide would travel approximately 2.1 miles. This distance is based on the assumption of rural terrain. Much of the area around the plant is, however, urban. On these sides of the plant, the distance to the \"endpoint\" is less than 2.1 miles. Within the larger affected area, a population of 5,100 would potentially be affected, including residences, schools, recreation areas, commercial and industrial facilities, a wildlife sanctuary, preserve or refuge and a National Forest.\n\nWorst Case Scenario - Flammable - Analysis of our processes showed the Worst Case Scenario (Flammable) to be the sudden and complete loss of a full tank (220,000 pounds) of dimethylamine. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate the evaporated dimethylamine would explode and the distance to a 1 psi over pressure would be approximately 0.45 miles. Within these areas, a population of 203 would potentially be affected, including recreation areas, commercial and industrial facilities, and a wildlife sanctuary, preserve or refuge. \n\nAlternative Scenarios:  While the alternative scenarios are still unlikely to occur, they are more likely to happen than are Worst Case Scenarios. In these scenarios, we can presume our Layers of Protection, our safety processes, our safety programs, our safety equipment and our people will be available and used. While these scenarios are more likely to happen than the Worse Case, and these are the scenarios that we use for Emergency Planning, our safety systems are designed to prevent them from happening.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - Toxic - Analysis of our systems indicate that the more likely toxic scenario would be continuous venting of vapor from the relief valve on the carbon disulfide tank because of tank over pressurization due to a fire in the containment pit below the tank.

In such case, the loss rate would be 30,000 pounds in one hour. Using EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate carbon disulfide would travel 0.76 miles before the concentration dispersed to a level considered by EPA to be non-hazardous. Within these areas, a population of 647 would potentially be affected, including residences, recreation areas, commercial and industrial facilities, and a wildlife sanctuary, preserve or refuge.\n\nAlternative Case Scenario - Flammable - Analysis of our systems indicate that the more likely scenario (flammable) would be the release of 25,000 pounds of methylamine from a 1\" hole in the tank. Our shower/deluge system would mitigate an estimated 70% of the released product, catching lost material in the secondary containment pit below the storage tank. Based on EPA's Offsite Guidance, we estimate the evaporated methylamine would explode and the distance to a 1 psi over pressure would be approximately 0.14 miles. Within these areas, a population of 9 would potentially be affected, including commercial and industrial facilities, and a wildlife sanctuary, preserve or refuge.\n\nAccident history:  In The past, we have experienced occasions when citizens have reported objectionable odors coming from the plant. We believe these odors to be from materials not regulated under RMP. Regardless, we have an obligation to determine the source(s) of these odors and to take actions to prevent a recurrence. In 1998, modifications to an existing scrubber were made which significantly improved its performance. Since then, no confirmed odor complaints have been received for the Washougal plant. Additionally,  increased scrubbing capacity for the Organics Unit has further aided in reducing emissions.\n\nThe goal at Kemira is to produce quality products and to produce them safely. We h"

Following is a partial listing of the Layers of Protection that we employ in our everyday activities.\n\nDesign: As previously stated, in the early days of the design of the Organics Unit, we used best engineering practices to assure the systems would operate as intended. We have concrete dikes (secondary containment) to catch any spilled materials.\n\nAll of our valve systems are designed to fail-safe. This means that in the event of computer failure or loss of electrical or air power, valves will return - open or closed as necessary - to the \"safe\" position.\n\nOn a regular schedule, we are required to complete a comprehensive review of the hazards and operability of our entire production system. If we find a valve, pipe, tank or pump that might fail and allow a release or an incident, we will correct it.\n\nMaintenance: We have a documented maintenance program in place. Using a combination of safety and quality programs, instrument calibration, prestartup safety reviews, Management of Change and a Work Order system are integrated into Maintenance.\n\nSafe Operations: Our employees are essential to the safe operation of our plant. Their training, their experience, their observations and their knowledge of how to respond to situations is the basis of safe operations. These people apply their knowledge and training in their everyday actions. All activities in the Organics unit - from unloading railcars to filling trucks and railcars with finished products - are restricted to trained, designated employees.\n\nMost activities in the Organics Unit are computer controlled. This means that nearly all actions taken by an operator are checked against an internal list in the computer's memory as well as with remote sensors to make sure it is the correct action. Established safe conditions must be met before actions can be completed. \n\nThe equipment and systems tha"
