In this way we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the PSM/RM Programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur ammonia refrigeration system consists basically of a cycle where liquid ammonia is evaporated while removing heat from the air or liquid surrounding it. The ammonia is always contained inside tubes, pipes or vessels. The vapor is then compressed and condensed so that liquid ammonia"

Under worst case scenario conditions, ammonia could travel 0.9 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely to occur for the following reasons:\nworst case scenario conditions are uncommon; compliance with industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive, pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance, inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary. Also installed ammonia sensors in the system to warn of leaks; alarms will sound.  The system is monitored over a 24-hour period seven days a week.  Finally we have a emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n \nAlternative Case Release Scenario:\nCorrosion of the pipe connection to the intercooler vessel results in a release of 151 lbs/min for 5 minutes. Under common weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  the preventative maintenance in place regularly maintains and inspects piping; there are pressure relief valves and pressure regulators that prevent sudden pressure increases.
