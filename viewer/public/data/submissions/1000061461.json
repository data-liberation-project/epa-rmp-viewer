This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the Butane transfer systems only, including the associated piping and thirty (30) approximate 31,000 gallon storage tanks detached railcars.\n\n\n\nStar Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) along with its fourteen (14) compliance elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations. The Butane transloading system is designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58, manufacturer's instructions and Sunoco Logistics specifications.  Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Star Terminal's Butane transloading system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Star Volunteer Fire Department and request their assistance. The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team, but outside services may be called in to assist. The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments (alternate departments include Biscoe and Troy) and the Montgomery LEPC. The Star Volunteer Fire Department is aware of the system, available protection systems (site fire extinguishers, emergency shut-off devices) and Emergency Response Procedures in place at the facility.\n\n\n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidental releases in the past "
