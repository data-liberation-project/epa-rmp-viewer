The Lansing LP Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Lansing, MI. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\r\n\r\nThe Lansing LP Terminal, located in Lansing, MI, is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment (HES) goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe Lansing LP Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection along with the process safety principles in RC14001. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Marathon has developed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\r\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\r\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\r\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\r\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. The Lansing LP Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety systems incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Lansing LP Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is then pumped to a blending/injection skid for direct injection into blend grade and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid, Bartec-Benke, and PLC Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, fusible elements (<250 degrees Fahrenheit), pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Lansing LP Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.

Marathon and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the Lansing LP Terminal also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures along with engineering and administrative controls to prevent a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\r\n\r\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices and company standards;\r\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\r\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process/Block Flow Diagrams;\r\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators (both on-site and remotely);\r\n-Computerized monitoring and automated process controls;\r\n-Redundant control systems with uninterruptable power supply; \r\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\r\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safe"
