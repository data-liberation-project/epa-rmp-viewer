      "SummaryText": "The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWDSC provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 16 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.  Lake Mathews is a very important storage reservoir in the MWDSC distribution system, holding raw water from the Colorado River before it is routed to treatment plants for processing as drinking water.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWDSC in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of this century.  MWDSC currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants.  \n\nIn addition, MWDSC uses chlorine for algae control in the Lake Mathews Reservoir Feeders, using the MWDSC owned Mobile Chlorination Unit III (MCU III).  However, chlorination for such algae control is performed infrequently. Thus, chlorine is not likely to be used at the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility for more than a few days during each year.\n\nIt should be noted there is no fixed schedule for bringing chlorine to the facility for algae control.  It should also be noted that when chlorination for algae control is not being performed, no chlorine is stored at the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility.\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.

Chlorine leak sensors are provided inside the MCU III and in the chlorine trailer manway.  In addition, the chlorine trailer angle valve, which is connected to the chlorination process is provided with an emergency electrically activated shutoff valve.  In case of a major chlorine release, chlorine supply from the chlorine trailer can be stopped by manually activating the shutoff valve.\n\nAn emergency shower and eye wash station is also provided at the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility; MCU III is parked near the wash station.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility, an alarm will alert the control room inside MCU III.  Loss of power will stop the water supply pump and turn off the evaporator; chlorine flow will stop and the system will be in standby, with no safety consequences.  MCU III also has a generator system which can provide sufficient power to run the total MCU III chlorination system, independent of Lake Mathews supplied power.\n\nAccess to the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility is controlled through a gate which is closed during non-working hours.  The facility also has a security guard on duty 24 hours a day.  The MCU III and the chlorine storage area are marked 'Authorized Personnel Only. In addition, two operators are continuously present during the temporary operation of the MCU III at the Lake Mathews Reservoir facility.

They will be Y2K compliant by July 31, 1999, though no Y2K problems are anticipated.\n\nThe MWDSC emergency response policy for chlorine involves the preparation of integrated contingency plans, which address emergency response for hazardous materials and are tailored to each facility.  These plans integrate with the emergency response services available in the community and are in compliance with the RMPR and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.

The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. \n\nFor the worst-case as well as alternative release scenarios, the released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) which disperse in the atmosphere.  The distances to the toxic endpoints were estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  No passive mitigation measures were considered for the worst-case release scenario.  However, administrative controls were considered which limit the quantity of chlorine in the storage vessel.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicate that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.

A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination facility pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no such chlorine releases, which could have resulted in offsite (Outside Lake Mathews Reservoir facility boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis where a release would reach offsite. Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgement. \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected involves the release of chlorine from the monel flexible hose connecting the chlorine storage vessel to the chlorination process.  This scenario can occur if the operator uses a flex hose which is worn or has a defect, resulting in a crack during withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine trailer. It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16-inch) diameter.  If such a release were to occur, the control room inside the MCU III would be immediately warned by the chlorine monitors at the MCU III.  It is assumed that approximately fifteen minutes would be required for the operators present at the MCU III to don personal protective equipment and activate the spring-loaded shutoff valve to close the valve at the chlorine trailer.  The activation of the spring-loaded valve is considered as an active mitigation.  This will reduce the total quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere during an accident.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of this scenario is highly unlikely because the flex hose is carefully inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds, once each shift.  In addition, under the MCU III preventive maintenance schedule, the flex hoses are replaced at least every two years (more frequently than recommended by the manufacturer).  \n\nThe alternative release scenario toxic endpoint distance was also estim"

The emergency response plan has a special focus on responding to chlorine emergencies.\n\nThe emergency response plan is being coordinated with local response agencies (Riverside County Fire Department).  The main elements of the emergency response plan are: (1) chlorine response flow chart, responsibilities of various personnel at the facility, duties of on-scene incident commander, HazMat responder team, (2) details of emergency recognition and prevention at the facility, (3) procedures for planning and coordination with off-site emergency response organizations, and (4) details of the training program for all HazMat responders. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges to improve chlorine safety were identified in December 1998, when the hazard review was performed.  It is expected that these recommended actions will be evaluated and implemented by December 1999."

This information includes chlorine background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the MCU III chlorine process. Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures, and safe upper and lower pressures to operate the processes are in documents kept with MCU III.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA detailed hazard review was conducted in December 1998 for the MCU III chlorination system equipment and procedures.  The hazard review will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is a major change in the process.  A list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nIn addition, all MWDSC chlorine systems have undergone a high priority evaluation for Y2K readiness.  They will be Y2K compliant by July 31, 1999, though no Y2K problems are anticipated.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMWDSC maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures for the MCU III that provide clear instructions for the chlorine process.  MWDSC ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system.  The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine trailer, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, chlorine system start-up and shut down, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, and chlorine system emergency operating procedures.  Also included are the switching procedur"
