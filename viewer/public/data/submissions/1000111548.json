(Chlorine was used for water treatment and was present over the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds, but its use has been discontinued as of November 2019). \n\nFacility Background:\n\nThe APG located approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore, Maryland and 50 miles south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC); U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) which includes the U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Health Command; the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD); and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe APG is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  \n\nRegulated substances\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is currently the only chemical for which APG is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  The anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant in an industrial refrigeration system for the CFF. The refrigerant charge exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold quantity. As a refriger"

In addition, FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford County Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR) 420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation.  \n\nThe most recent Chemical Accident Or Incident Response And Assistance (CAIRA) exercise at APG was held on December 12, 2024.  Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) conducted an Ammonia Action review on March 4, 2024, including a test of the ATC notification system.\n\nPlanned changes:\n\nAPG is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the RMP, and no significant changes to the system are currently planned. A variety of physical security measures are in place at all facilities, to include patrols by armed security forces to prevent unauthorized access. The ammonia refrigeration system at the climatic firing facility was constructed and installed to the latest engineering design and safety standards, safety valves were installed in the system to substantially reduce the quantity of any release, and air monitoring was installed in all buildings serviced by the refrigeration system to provide an early warning system for personnel in and around the facility and system equipment shutdown."
