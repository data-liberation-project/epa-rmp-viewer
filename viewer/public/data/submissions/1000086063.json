The District encompasses approximately 15,695 acres and is located in an area with residential, commercial, and recreational areas.  The Eck Lane Water Treatment Plant currently serves the entire WCID 17 service area.  Parts of the District's service area are located within the jurisdiction of the City of Austin, the City of Lakeway, and the City of Bee Cave.\n\n\n\nThe Eck Lane Water Treatment Plant is located adjacent to the WCID 17 main office at 3812 Eck Lane, Austin, TX 78734, in the Hudson Bend sub-division near Lake Travis. This water treatment plant uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant.  The chlorine is stored on-site in ton cylinders.  The maximum supply stored on-site is approximately 12,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nThe process system consists of six (6) one-ton stainless steel cylinders and an all vacuum feed / injection system. Four (4) of the six (6) one-ton cylinders are kept in service during normal operation and two are used as spare.  A chlorine leak detector, set to 1 ppm with remote sensors mounted approximately 1-inch above the floor, is connected to an audible alarm system that also pages the operator in the event of an emergency. The chlorine system is monitored during the week several times a day by an on-site operator and is monitored daily on the weekends.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly with the equipment serviced annually regardless of condition.\n\n\n\nField personnel and the general manager receive formal training as required by 29 CFR 1910.120, in conjunction with the local fire department personnel, in emergency response for water/wastewater treatment facilities.  This training includes hands on experience with SCBA, Level A suits, and liquid and gas identification.  Emergency equipment is maintained on-site.\n\n\n\nTravis County WC&ID N"

A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is also kept at WC&ID No. 17's main office. In the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas, emergency response will be coordinated with Travis County Emergency Service District No. 6.  Travis County ESD No. 6 is located approximately 3 minutes from the water treatment plant and the Lakeway Regional Medical Center is located approximately 10 minutes from the plant.  There have been no reportable accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past fifteen years.\n\n"
