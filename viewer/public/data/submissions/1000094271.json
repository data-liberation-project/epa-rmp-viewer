      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n    The PPG Circleville facility complies with applicable Ohio and USEPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PPG Circleville also adheres to PPG's EHS Management System (MS)and its elements guiding community interaction, emergency response and risk mitigation.  PPG's EHS MS is our methodology for ensuring both regulatory compliance and compliance with external standards such as Responsible Care & ISO 14001.  All of these activities are an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Heath, and Safety Policy, whose goal is \"to manufacture, sell, and distribute products worldwide in a manner that is safe and protective of our employees, neighbors, customers, other stakeholders, and the environment.\"\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\n    PPG Circleville is a part of the PPG Automotive Coatings Group of PPG Industries, Inc.  PPG Circleville produces resins used in the manufacture of automotive coatings.  The facility stores and uses Toluene 2, 4 Di-Isocyanate and Toluene 2,6 Di-Isocyanate, both of which are referred to in this document as TDI.  The EPA-RMP list identifies TDI as a toxic material.\n\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n    An off-site consequence analysis was performed for the largest quantity of TDI (toxic material) stored in any given tank at the facility.  EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidelines for Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and its lookup tables were used to complete the analyses.\n\n\n\n    EPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release of the entire contents of the largest storage container.  Based on EPA RMP criteria, the worst case release scenario would have a potential impact radius of 0.4 miles from the point of release.  This would impact our two closest industrial neighbors.\n\n\n\n    An alternative scenario was also studied which would model a flange failure in a transfer line.  Based on the"

      "SummaryText": " EPA RMP criteria, the alternative case release scenario does not have an offsite impact.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n    There have not been any accidents associated with this process in the past five years. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n    The RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all plants must be classified as Program Level 1, 2, or 3 processes.  PPG Circleville's TDI process is classified as a Program Level 3 process due to the Worst-Case Scenario having potential off-site impacts and due to our applicable North America Industry Classification System code.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\n    The facility manages and trains its own internal Emergency Response Team.  In addition, PPG reaches out to local emergency response organizations (procedures, training, drills, etc.) to participate in table top exercises and facility tours.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n    PPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations.  Changes in the manufacturing equipment, operating practices, and process controls are made, as necessary, to assure process reliability and effective minimization of accidental release.
