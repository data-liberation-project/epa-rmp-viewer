Populations in these radii are 3,700 and 590, respectively. Treatment plant uses written procedures for chlorine cylinder replacement and monitors building for chlorine leakage. There have been no accidents in the past 5 years.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWe have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Chanute believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to handle chlorine in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe Chanute Water Treatment Plant has chosen to be a non-responding facility in the event of an emergency.  Responsibility for emergency response to an accidental release has been given to the Chanute Police and Fire Departments and the State and Local Emergency Response Centers.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances.\n\nThe Chanute Water Treatment Plant utilizes chlorine and ammonia as disinfectants for the treated drinking water.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantities for these chemicals are shown below.\n\n \tChemical\t\tMaximum Inventory (lb.)\tThreshold Quantity (lb.)\n\tChlorine\t\t               10,250\t\t                 2,500\n\t\t\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe offsite consequent analysis includes a worst-case scenario and an alternative release scenario as defined in 40 C.F.R 68.
