We also have a 12,000-gallon storage tank that holds 56,078 pounds. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds.  The facility has thirty-three 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, and 5 560-gallon applicators, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 290,850 pounds.\n\n3.
