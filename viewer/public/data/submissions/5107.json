This program is designed to provide information required by both the RMP rule for Program 3 facilities and the elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule at 29 CFR 1910.119.  The program is intended to prevent or reduce the risk of major incidents that might expose employees or off-site populations to the hazards of toxic chemicals, fire, or explosion.  Specific elements include safety information, hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, compliance audits, and incident investigation, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractor analysis.",

Morton Road\nJacksonville, Illinois  62650\n\nThis plan summarizes the Risk Management Program (RMP) developed and implemented at the AC HUMKO facility located at 1201 E. Morton Road in Jacksonville, Illinois.  In compliance with applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP requirements, the AC HUMKO Risk Management Program document, which is summarized by this plan, describes the following components of a RMP:\n\n- A hazard assessment program that identifies and analyzes the potential onsite and off-site impacts of worst-case and alternate release scenarios of regulated substances, and includes documentation of five-year accident histories involving regulated substances.\n\n- A prevention program that covers operating procedures, maintenance, training, management of change, process safety information, and other similar information involving regulated substances.\n\n- An emergency response and action plans to mitigate any accidental releases that occur.\n\n- An overall system to manage the development and implementation of a risk management system.\n\nThe plan is submitted in accordance with applicable regulations for the on-site refrigeration process covered by RMP regulations.\n\nThe subject ACH facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature in food manufacturing operations.  \n\nThe refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia at a stationary source in amounts greater that the RMP and OSHA PSM threshold of 10,000 pounds and a catastrophic release of this substance could impact public receptors.  Therefore, the subject facility is regulated by Program 3 requirements.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents involving ammonia within the past 5-years.\n\nAC HUMKOs Emergency Response Program was developed in accordance with OSHA  regulatory requirements cited in 20 CFR 1910.38 and 20 CFR 1910.120.
