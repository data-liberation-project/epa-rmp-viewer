      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Bogalusa plant #328, located at 2032 Columbia Street, Bogalusa, Louisiana, is a manufacturer of ice for wholesale and retail distribution. The facility has a potential production capacity of 250 to 300 tons of ice per day and utilizes approximately 22,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration operation makes use of standard design ammonia systems. There are eight distinct refrigeration systems in the plant with numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, high level cutouts on all vessel and approved safety relief valves on all applicable equipment. Each system is comprised of one or more compressor packages, evaporative or shell and tube condensers, high-pressure and/or low-pressure ammonia vessels, and either tube icemakers or air-cooling evaporators.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\r\n\r\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include engine room purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are exceeded, computerized PLC controls on the icemaker system in Engine Room 2, safety relief valves on all vessels, and the capability of shutting down the entire system if required. Administrative controls are in place that limit the utilization of vessels at less than 50% of their intended capacities."

      "SummaryText": "The company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\r\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Bogalusa facility's ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate management and Reddy Ice-Bogalusa management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audits, and trade secrets. These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assig"

A delegated safety director who implements monthly plant inspections and safety meetings to address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month. Each department may conduct monthly safety meetings covering topics pertinent to the job hazards in that area.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Bogalusa facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Bogalusa facility has had one release that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.  On June 3, 2007, an 12-pound release of ammonia vapor resulted in the suspected damage of a neighbor's garden costing Reddy Ice $5500 in corrections.  No on-site or off-site persons were injuried.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Bogalusa facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, and revised and updated as necessary to reflect changes in facility operations and personnel.\r\n\r\nAs required, the facility has coordinated emergency response activiti"

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES\r\nThe Reddy Ice-Bogalusa facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. On a corporate level, Reddy Ice is continuing to implement ammonia diffusion/neutralization system installation at all plants and supporting the installation of additional ammonia detection, alarm, ventilation, and safety systems at its larger facilities."
