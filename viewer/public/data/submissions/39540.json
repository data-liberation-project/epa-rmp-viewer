      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Chemical Facilities At Mebane Bridge Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at City of Eden, Mebane Bridge Wastewater Treatment plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass treatment and disinfection of industrial and domestic wastewater.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for bacterial disinfection of wastewater effluent discharge.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 16000.00 lb.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Disinfection.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 9.1% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles "

The scenario involves the release of 50 lb. of chlorine gas .  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to from a hole or connection producing a small leak.  The 180 minutes the estimated time would take the responding agency to be on site and stop the leak.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCity of Eden, Mebane Bridge Wastewater Treatment plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and What-Ifs.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with thorough knowledge of the mechanical equipment and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 30 months.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/21/2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, City of Eden, Mebane Bridge Wastewater Treatment plant maintains written operating"
