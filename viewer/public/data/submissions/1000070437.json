      "SummaryText": "The City of Sweetwater, Texas (City) operates the Sweetwater Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The Sweetwater WTP is located at 169 CR 217, Sweetwater, Nolan County, Texas 79556.  The Sweetwater WTP produces potable water for the City of Sweetwater, the City of Trent, and the City of Roby.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 12,600 pounds of chlorine gas may be stored at the Sweetwater WTP.  Chlorine gas and sodium chlorite form chlorine dioxide gas, then chlorine dioxide solution.  Although chlorine dioxide gas is an RMP-regulated substance, the quantity of chlorine dioxide gas produced on-site is significantly less than the 1,000-pound RMP threshold quantity since the chlorine dioxide gas is immediately converted into chlorine dioxide solution and no chlorine dioxide gas is stored on-site. Chlorine solution and liquid ammonium sulfate (LAS) form chloramines in the treatment plant.  Additional chemicals are used in the treatment process.  The sodium chlorite, LAS, and the additional chemicals on-site are not chemicals subject to risk management planning.  \n\n\n\nBecause the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (?68.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Sweetwater WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (?68.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include commitments to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine gas are prevented.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.

      "SummaryText": "Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (?68.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Sweetwater WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (?68.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (?68.50 & ?68.58).\n\n\n\nThe Sweetwater WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR ?1910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Sweetwater WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Sweetwater WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via calling 9-1-1 in the event of a chlorine release from the Sweetwater WTP.  The City of Sweetwater's Fire Department"
