      "SummaryText": "Conway County Regional Water Distribution District is a potable water supplier in Conway County, Arkansas. We are a public entity created by Act 114 of 1957 by the Arkansas Legislature.\nCCRWDD uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant in our treatment process of water. CCRWDD has approximately 6000 lbs. on site in 1-ton cylinders. Due to the toxic qualities and its form, this gas could pose a threat to public health if released.\nCCRWDD stores and utilizes chlorine gas in 1-ton cylinders in a separate bulinding specifically designed for its use. This building isequipped with automatic vents and leak detectors. These dectectors are monitored in the control room of the plant 24 hours a day.\nAll plant personnel and two supervisors are trained in leak detection and containment. During the fall of 2004, we conducted a simulated release of Chlorine gas in conjuction with the Conway County OEM and the County fire Dept.\nRoutine maintanence of the chlorine equpment is continual and reviewed by an outside source on a yearly basis.We maintain two SCBA's and two chlorine ton cylinder repair kits. All written procedures are incoporated in our Emergency Response Plan."
