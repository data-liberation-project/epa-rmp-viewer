There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plants. A PSM Implementation Manual was edited to be site specific for each Wastewater Plant. The Manual was issued to the plants. In 1999 the Manual was expanded to address the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nKey items included in the updated manual are:\n\no\tA written Management Program defining the positions and individuals responsible for implementing the RMP and PSM regulations\n\no\tWritten site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits\n\no\tChlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no\tStandard Operating Procedures for safe Chlorine Management\n\no\tA Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine equipment \n\no\tAn Emergency Response Plan to address chlorine emergencies and offsite response and communication\n\nNext, these steps have been continually implemented to maintain compliance with the PMP/PSM program.\n\no\tTraining on RMP/PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation;\n\no\tConducting periodically Process Hazards Analyses for the two chlorine processes;\n\no\tImplementing the Mechanical Integrity Program for chlorine regulators, controls and material handling equipments such as cranes\n\no\tConducting Self Audits to review compliance with the elements of RMP and PSM\n\no\tConducting periodic Chlorine Response Drills.\n\no\tPerforming an annual review of our Chlorine Operating Procedures\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals\n\n- The chlorine delivery systems at the plants"

This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine. \n\n- In January 1999, an automatic switchover system was installed on the chlorine cylinders at both plants. This system is designed to automatically switch from an empty to a full chlorine cylinder. This process avoids the need for an operator to manually change the cylinders at anytime, day or night.\n\n- In January 1999, chlorine leak detectors were installed at the chlorine facilities at both plants. This equipment will detect any chlorine leak allowing operators to initiate emergency response\n\nThe city safety coordinator, plant superintendent, chief operator and several plant operators are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the RMP/PSM regulation.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plans (ERP) for the two wastewater treatment plant have been significantly upgraded. In 1997, the ERP were revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. As noted above periodic emergency response drills are being conducted.\n\nIn addition to RMP and PSM, the organization has an active safety program. The City has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. The Safety and Risk Manager for the City also takes an active role in supporting the Public Services Safety Program. \n\nWithin the Public Services department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n- Personal Pr"
