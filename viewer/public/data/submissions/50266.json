It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Olin Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 6 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Olin, Iowa location is Eric Hall, location  manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. In addition, the following individuals (with associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers) are to be contacted in order:\n\n                     Eric Hall, location manager\n                               WORK:   (319) 484-2341\n                               Home:     (563) 388-6484\n                               Cell:        (563) 357-0893\n\n                     Mike Wagner, Regional Manager\n                               WORK:   (563) 942-3365\n                              "

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. From time-to-time throughout the year as many as thirty (30) 1,000-gallon and three (3) 2,000-gallon portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is two (2).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.                                         \n\nThe system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, r"

The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Olin, the unincorporated community of Hale, and the State Game Management Area of Muskrat Slough, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons in those areas. Even though the community of Hale and the unincorporated communities of Newport and Cedar Island do not fall in the 4.4 mile distance to endpoint, their proximity to the area in the total distance to endpoint has been considered in the event that conditions dictate.  An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, River Valley Cooperative has extended to the Olin Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nRiver Valley Cooperative, Olin, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death,  property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place. However, on July 11, 2007 following an act of theft for the apparent production of methamphetamine"

They had circumvented the locking valve cover on the nurse tank. One woman suffered severe eye irritation and was treated at the scene by the ambulance crew. Both women were later transported to the local hospital for observation. They were treated and released the same day. The incident was investigated by the Jones County, Iowa Sheriff's Department.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of River Valley  Cooperative  to immediately notify the Olin Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 6 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Olin Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Olin location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Olin has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 6 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual"

In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
