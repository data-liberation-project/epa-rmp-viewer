OxyChem has a mechanical integrity program providing an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nOxyChem's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release:  In the event of an accidental release, the Taft plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment.  OxyChem trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  This training includes response training for its personnel, designating an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducting regular drills to review response activities, and coordinating response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies. OxyChem works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) and Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  In addition, OxyChem has established a Special Situations Center at our corporate offices in Dallas, Texas to assistant in all emergencies.\n\nOxyChem utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  The Taft plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Louisiana, and EPA regulations.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Taft plant.

This plant, the Taft plant, is bordered on the south by Louisiana Highway 3127, on the east by Louisiana Highway 3142, to the north by Louisiana Highway 18, and on the west by other industrial facilities.  Overall, the Taft plant has about 347 full-time employees, including contractors.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (\u0015 68.155(b)):\n\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Taft plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. It is Taft plant policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations, industry standards, and best practices.  In order to effectively implement these policies, OxyChem established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Departments to oversee safety and environmental activities. As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Taft plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Taft plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Taft plant.\n\nThe risk management program at"

OxyChem implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include programs to train personnel, to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes, and to evaluate the hazards at the Taft plant.  The Taft plant participates in auditing processes like OSHA VPP to measure and enhance its prevention program.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (\u0015 68.155(b)):\n\nThe Taft plant consists of two Chlor-Alkali plants which manufacture chlorine, caustic and hydrogen.  There is also a sulfur monochloride manufacturing unit at Taft.  The Taft complex has facilities to store, load, and ship the chlorine and the other materials.  One Chlor-Alkali plant was constructed in 1966, the other plant in 1973.  The Taft plant handles only one regulated substance that is covered by the RMP rule:  chlorine.  It is an RMP covered Program Level 3 process.\n\nRegulated Substance              Process                Largest Vessel Inventory, lbs.

In June 1993, the Taft plant became ISO 9002 registered.\n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (\u0015 68.155(c)):\n\nThe Taft plant has performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a worst case release scenario  and an alternative release scenario for each toxic in a process over the threshold quantity.  In reality, however, OxyChem does not expect the worst-case release scenario to occur.  The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the Local Emergency Planning Committee, LEPC, and the Department of Emergency Preparedness, DEP,  improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nEPA Comp was used for evaluating the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternate case scenarios.

Although the facility limits the inventory level in the tank to 90%, it was not used in the scenario. The worst case release scenario was evaluated following EPA's Comp software.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel a distance greater than 25 miles before the concentration of chlorine was reduced to below 3 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). The U.S. Census indicates that 847,183 people live within this distance from tank;  several public receptors are also located within this distance, including residences, schools, hospitals, prisons, recreational and industrial areas. Environmental receptors located within this distance include Indian Mounds near Grand Point. In addition, Salvador and Manchac State Wildlife Management Areas are included within this distance.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario is a 1/4 inch hole in a tank outlet pipe in the #2 Chlor-Alkali plant which results in a release of 8,400 pounds of chlorine over a 120 minute duration.  The alternate case release scenario was evaluated following EPA's Comp software.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the chlorine gas cloud would travel 0.2 miles before the concentration of chlorine was reduced to below 3 ppm (which is the 'endpoint' Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule). There are no residences within a 0.2 mile radius of the alternate case scenario. The only public receptors are commercial and industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (\u0015 68.155(d)):\n\nThe Taft plant has always had prevention and maintenance programs in place to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in May 1992, the plant revised and integrated these programs for the chlorine manufacturing and storage processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program (29 CFR part 1910.119).  The facility is currently in compliance with the PSM program.  The Taft plant complies with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule (40 CFR part 68) which was promulgated in 1996.  As a participant in the OSHA Voluntary Participation Program (VPP), the facility has had an initial audit and a recertification audit both conducted by OSHA to maintain program status since 1994.  Since 1994 the Taft plant has been listed as an OSHA Star facility, the highest ranking by OSHA for a plant's safety program.\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant's fence line.  It is the EPA's intention that facilities develop one prevention program to protect both worker safety, the public, and the environment.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Taft plant's Program 3 prevention program that address EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements.  The Taft plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information \n\nThe Taft plant maintains a variety of technical documents which are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.
