The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Beaver Water District implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0    Description of the Beaver Water District and Regulated Substances\nThe Beaver Water District Water Treatment Facility is located in Lowell, Arkansas near the shores of Beaver Lake.  The Beaver Water District handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) at each of six processes located on the facility. This substance is:\n* Chlorine - stored in 2000 pound cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\nThe chlorine is stored and used in quantities above the listed threshold of the RMP Rule and the storage vessels and associated equipment are therefore considered ?covered processes?.\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\nThe RMP Rule requires The Beaver Water District to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facilities.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination processes at each water treatment process.\nThe information obtained from this Hazard Assessment has been appropr"

Based on the guidelines of the RMP Rule, the processes are considered Program Level 2 and a prevention program has been developed according to the Program Level 2 requirements. The following details the prevention program elements at the Beaver Water District that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\nThe Beaver Water District maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the Beaver Water District processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at the Beaver Water District, including the chlorine in the covered processes.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\nThe Beaver Water District performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure the Beaver Water District operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\nThe Beaver Water District develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4    Training\nThe Beaver Water District trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure"

A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n4.5    Maintenance\nThe Beaver Water District properly maintains the equipment in our processes.  The Beaver Water District maintenance program includes:\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6    Compliance Audits\nThe Beaver Water District performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule.  A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n4.7    Incident Investigations\nThe Beaver Water District investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The Beaver Water District trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8    Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\nIndustry standards are followed at the Beaver Water District to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 2000 pound cylinders. The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, Compressed Gas Association, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.
