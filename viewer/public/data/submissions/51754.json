      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Pilgrim's Pride Live Oak Processing Facility.  The reason for submitting this RMP is to add Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation as the Owner of this facility and to identify a new Emergency contact.  This facility has two refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  Because the two systems are tied together with a common transfer line, they are considered one system for the purpose of this Risk Management Plan.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in the total system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions with the Live Oak Fire Department and the District 3 LEPC and ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous chemical, our accidental release prevention policy is designed to comply with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations of these two agencies.  These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulatio"
