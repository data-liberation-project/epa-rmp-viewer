      "SummaryText": "The Praxair facility at Ontario, California is a hydrogen production plant.  We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form the hydrogen, which we then purify and liquefy.  The final cryogenic liquid hydrogen product is stored in our insulated storage tank, and is shipped by truck and railcar to customers throughout the west.  Hydrogen is listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The production and storage process at the Ontario plant contains about 190,000 pounds of hydrogen, and is therefore subject to the RMP rule.\n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report a Worst Case Scenario for the Ontario plant, which is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest hydrogen vessel in our process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The release is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Ontario facility, the largest hydrogen vessel contains about 190,000 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.64 miles to the EPA-specified endpoint.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP*Comp\" modeling software.\n\nWe are also required to report an Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, under the RMP rule.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario,"

      "SummaryText": "and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.  For the Ontario hydrogen process, a credible release would be through a bursting disk on the hydrogen storage tank, with the released hydrogen gas igniting and causing a small vapor cloud explosion.  At the Ontario facility, a release of this type would result in a maximum impact distance of about 0.09 miles, or slightly under 500 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's \"RMP*Comp\" modeling software.\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Ontario facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.  On a local level, this prevention program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n7 Documented process safety information to ensure the process design is understood and maintained throughout its life;\n7 Process hazard analysis to identify and control all of the hazards associated with handling hydrogen;\n7 Trained operators, using written operating procedures, to safely operate the process as intended; and\n7 Maintenance programs and procedures to ensure the on-going mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nThe prevention program is audited periodically, by our corporate assessment group, to ensure that the process safety concepts and practices are in place and working effectively.\n\nAs a result of our process safety and risk management practices, the Ontario facility has not had an accident involving hydrogen in the last five years.
