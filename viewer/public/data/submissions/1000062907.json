The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are transported onward to another facility for processing.\n\n\n\nBadger Midstream Energy, LP has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Grey Badger Gas Plant is located near Borger, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Natural Gas Liquid Product\n\n2. Condensate \n\n3. Residue Gas\n\n4. Helium\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Grey Badger Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 271,325 pounds (60,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in one of the two pressurized Natural Gas Liquids Storage Tanks (TK801 or TK802). The entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations, the 1 psi overpressure was reached at 0.52 miles. The WCS could affect a nearby public receptor. A consideration of the 0.52 mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for th"

The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as ensuring proposed process and facility changes to safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nBadger Midstream Energy has a comprehensive program to identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered process.\n\n\n\nThis program systematically exams for potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. Process Hazard Analysis is conducted using checklists with a team of Badger Midstream Energy employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies, evaluates and makes recommendations to management of potential hazards identified. The team's findings are forwarded to Badger Midstream Energy Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD.

Training\n\n\n\nBadger Midstream Energy has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\n\n\nF.
