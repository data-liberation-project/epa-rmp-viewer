              "Description": "Process 1 - Silane Transfilling\n\n- Silane processes are covered in site Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Employees are\n\ntrained to these SOPs and are re-trained whenever any changes are made.\n\n- Employees are required to wear standard site PPE which includes flame resistant clothing.\n\n- A visual inspection is required prior to each use to the transfill system. Once the visual\n\ninspection is completed, a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak\n\ncheck is performed.\n\n- Maintenance Team performs preventative maintenance.\n\n- During transfilling, only the required amount of Silane is valved open on the bulk tank to\n\nminimize any potential escape in case of a leak; helps reduce response time on bulk tank.\n\n- Silane system is continuously monitored when in use.\n\n- Emergency shutdown buttons are located near the system in case of an emergency.\n\n- Fire detection/suppression system is in place at the transfill area as well as the bulk source.\n\n- The bulk source is staged in an area with three fire walls.\n\n- The Silane filling system is in a Class 1, Division II room.\n\n- Silane system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n- The Silane system has minimal threaded connections and connections are welded wherever\n\npossible. Piping material is 316L stainless steel and the system incorporates double seal\n\ndesign which provides the highest leak free integrity.\n\n- Silane transfilling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and\n\ngauges. This cross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an\n\noverfill condition to occur.\n\n- Any changes to the process require a Management of Change, a Process Hazard\n\nAssessment, and potentially a ready to operate review (RTOR).",

Employees are\n\ntrained to these SOPs and are re-trained whenever any changes are made.\n\n- Employees are required to wear standard site PPE which includes flame resistant clothing.\n\n- The Storage of Silane incorporates several preventative actions that ensure safe and leak\n\nfree storage.\n\n- A visual inspection of the Silane storage is done on a periodic period, if not daily. Silane\n\nleakage will leave a white or brownish type staining (silicon dioxide powder) when the Silane\n\ncomes in contact with air.\n\n- The greatest hazard of Silane is flammable potential. Silane is a pyrophoric gas that burns\n\nupon contact with air. Operators wear personal protective equipment including flame resistant\n\nclothing. Fire detection/suppression systems are in place at bulk source. The bulk source is\n\nstaged in an area surrounded on three sides with fire walls.\n\n- Any changes to the storage of Silane require a Management of Change, a Process Hazard\n\nAssessment, and potentially a ready to operate review (RTOR).",

Once the visual\n\ninspection is complete a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check\n\nis performed.\n\n- Maintenance Team performs preventative maintenance.\n\n- During transfilling, only the required amount of DCS is valved open on the bulk tank to\n\nminimize any potential escape in case of a leak; helps reduce response time on bulk tank.\n\n- DCS system is continuously monitored when in use.\n\n- Emergency shutdown buttons are located near the system in case of an emergency.\n\n- Fire detection/suppression system is in place at the transfill area as well as the bulk source.\n\n- The DCS filling system is in a Class 1, Division II room\n\n- DCS system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n- The DCS system has minimal threaded connections and connections are welded wherever\n\npossible. Piping material is 316L stainless steel and the system incorporates double seal\n\ndesign which provides the highest leak free integrity.\n\n- DCS transfilling is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and\n\ngauges.

Once the visual\n\ninspection is complete a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check\n\nis performed.\n\n- HCl system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n- The HCl system is constructed of 316L Stainless Steel.\n\n- The HCl is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This\n\ncross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill\n\ncondition to occur.\n\n- Any changes to the process require an MOC, a Process Hazard Assessment, and potentially\n\na ready to operate review (RTOR).",

Once the visual\n\ninspection is complete a leak check is performed using helium. Lastly, a vacuum leak check\n\nis performed.\n\n- Cl2 system is shut down and isolated at the end of each workday.\n\n- The Cl2 system is constructed of 316L Stainless Steel and connections are welded where\n\npossible.\n\n- Cl2 system is continuously monitored when in use.\n\n- The Cl2 is monitored by both weight and pressure using calibrated scales and gauges. This\n\ncross-reference between weight and pressure minimizes the possibility of an overfill\n\ncondition to occur.\n\n- Cl2 system is contained inside of a building which would result in a smaller dispersion\n\ndistance should a release ever occur.\n\n- Any changes to the process require an MOC, a Process Hazard Assessment, and potentially\n\na ready to operate review (RTOR).",

At the plant, a stand alone building has been designated as a command post center where ER equipment is stored and emergencies can be managed. The building also contains the key contact information to communicate to outside agencies and local authorities.  The Emergency Response Team members have completed their initial 40 hour training requirement and also receive their annual required 8 hour refresher training.   Plant communicates with the Bucks County Emergency Management, the Bucks County LEPC and the Morrisville Fire Department. \n\n\n\nThe Morrisville Plant maintains a facility Emergency Action Plan that has been shared with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
