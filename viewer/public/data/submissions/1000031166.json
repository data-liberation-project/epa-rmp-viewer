      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Goodrich Aerospace Pueblo facility produces carbon brakes for aircraft.  Carbon textile material is received by the facility and is first cut, d and prepared for the brake production process.  The textile is then sent to the furnace deck area where it undergoes carbonization and densification in a series of furnaces.  Next, the densified carbon brake parts are machined to the appropriate configuration.  Finally, the non-wearing surfaces of the brakes are coated with an oxidation inhibitor and mounting hardware is attached.  Some reprocessing of used brakes is also conducted at the facility.  In addition to the direct manufacturing activities, a variety of support operations are involved at the Pueblo facility.  On-site laboratories perform both research and development, and quality assurance/quality control functions. Both routine and non-routine maintenance is also conducted on vehicles and equipment.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses propane in the brake production process.  The propane storage tank (18,000 gallon capacity) is located outside the southwest corner of the furnace deck building.  The maximum inventory of the storage tank is 69,000 pounds of propane.  The storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII) and contains two safety relief valves.  The propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail.  The perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario evaluated for propane at the facility involves the release of the entire tank (69,000 pounds) over a 10-minute period.  The propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate.  Ten percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  Other assumptions include Atmospheric"

USEPA's RMP*Comp version 1.07 calculated the distance to the endpoint for this worst-case propane release scenario to be 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nThe endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental propane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short term exposures will no longer occur.  For propane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures.\n\n\n\nThe population within the estimated worst case impact area for propane is estimated to be 0 people using the 2010 Census data and the Marplot mapping software package.  However, it was determined that there are commercial properties within the endpoint of the worst-case impact radius.  Therefore, because the propane system is also subject to the PSM rule, the propane system is a Program 3.  There are no other public or environmental receptors within the worst case impact radius.\n\n\n\nAlthough a worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP Rule, a worst-case occurrence is a highly unlikely event.  The possibility of a catastrophic failure of the storage tank is extremely remote because:  (1) the storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards (i.e. ASME and NFPA 58 Codes); (2) the tank is equipped with two safety relief valves to prevent over pressurization and catastrophic release; (3) the perimeter of the facility is fenced and access to the site is controlled to prevent tampering; (4) the propane tank is protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail; and (5) the external surface of the tank is visually inspected on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario is also required for Program 3, and is considered "

      "SummaryText": "\"more likely\" to occur than the worst case scenario, but must still be significant enough to impact off-site areas (i.e., achieve at least the EP at the plant fence line).  The Risk Management Program Guidance For Propane Storage Facilities (\"Propane Guidance\") was used to select a credible alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen represents the incident that is most likely to occur but is still severe enough to achieve the EP at the facility fence line.  This scenario assumes that the tank is overfilled, and one of the 2\" safety relief valves (set at 255 pounds per square inch gauge) lifts to relieve the excess pressure.  The valve is assumed to have a flow capacity of 8,300 standard cubic feet (Air) per minute, and is assumed to remain open for five minutes.  The \"Propane Guidance\" was used to estimate the distance to the EP, assuming the same vapor cloud explosion described in the worst case scenario (the released vapor forms a cloud, of which 10 percent ignites).  The distance to the EP (1 psi) is calculated to be 0.13 mile.  There are no residential populations within this distance.  Also, there are no environmental receptors within this impact radius.\n\n\n\nAlthough an alternative release consequence analysis is required by the RMP rule, a failure and release of propane that is large enough to reach an EP beyond the fence line is not likely because the propane vendor follows a procedure designed to ensure that the filling of the tank is safely accomplished by qualified personnel.  Additionally, the tank is not re-filled until it has reached 30% capacity or less.\n\n\n\nETHANE\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a fleet of ethane trailers.  The maximum inventory of ethane is 28,000 pounds, and the maximum capacity of a single ethane trailer hooked up to the process is 13,500 pounds. \n\n\n\nFor a worst-case release scenario, the facility must assume that the entire contents of both the ethane trailers and the distribution system (28,000  pounds) for "

      "SummaryText": "the trailers is released as the vessels are interconnected through the vapor distribution system such that once the pressure is below a certain point on one trailer, the valve for the second trailer opens to the system.  Under this release scenario, a vapor cloud forms, and 10% of the cloud detonates.  Other assumptions include Atmospheric Stability Class F, an ambient temperature of 77 degrees F, and 50% relative humidity.  The distance to the endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental ethane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short term exposures will no longer occur.  For ethane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 psi.  An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures.  EPA's RMP*Comp calculated the distance to the endpoint for a worst case ethane release to be 0.2 mile.\n\n\n\nThe population within the estimated worst case impact area for ethane is estimated to be 0 people using the 2010 Census data and the Marplot 4.2.2 mapping software package.  However, there are commercial properties within the endpoint of the worst-case impact radius. Therefore, because the ethane system is also subject to the PSM rule, the ethane system it is a Program 3. There are no other public or environmental receptors within the worst case impact radius.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that Marplot 4.2.2 calculates populations within a defined radius by evaluating Census 2010 Blocks. A block is the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau tabulates 100 percent data.  Marplot 4.2.2 will estimate the population within a radius as the sum of all Census 2010 Blocks whose centroids fall within that radius.  The radius of impact (0.3 miles) for the worst-case release scenario for propane includes the centroid for Blocks 1039, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1043, 1055, 1056, 1134 1171 and 1164, which has an associated population of "

The key components of the RMP prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n-  The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of the process and the design of the system and equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the covered processes.\n\n-  The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant {i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize covered processes are the most knowledgeable about it and are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n-  The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on covered processes using the checklist and flowchart study methods.  PHAs address:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failures; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effect"

PHAs may result in procedural and/or hardware recommendations to improve the safety and operation of the covered processes, and all recommendations are tracked and resolved.  PHAs will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n-  Written operating procedures (OPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of covered processes.  The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n-  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to covered processes.\n\n-  Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n-  Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of a regulated substance are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the investigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent recurrence.\n\n-  Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the covered processes are \"pre-qualified\" based on their knowledge of the system, understanding of applicable codes and standards, written safety and training programs, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.\n\n-  Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark "
