Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Verona Pumping Station (Water Treatment Plant) are strongly committed to\nemployee, public and environmental safety. This is demonstrated, by an accidental release\nprevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance and employee training associated with the process at our facility. It is our\npolicy, through the use of appropriate controls, to prevent the release of the regulated\nsubstance used in our operation. If such a release should occur, we are completely\ncoordinated with the HAZMAT unit of the Battle Creek Fire Department. They would\nprovide the highly trained emergency response personnel to control the effects of any\nrelease.\n\nThe Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe primary activity of the Verona Pumping Station is Municipal Water Supply and\nTreatment. We have 1 regulated substance at our facility. That substance is Chlorine. It is\nused in the treatment process for oxidation and disinfection.\n\nThe maximum inventory at the Verona Pumping Station is 24,000 lbs. It is stored in 1\nlocation in 2,000 lb. cylinders.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including\nadministrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each scenario.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario, RMP Comp Software ver. 1.07. We have used the same\nSoftware for the alternative scenario. The details are as follows.\n\nThe worst case scenario involves a direct release of 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, a maximum distance of 1.3 miles is needed in an urban setting to reach a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe Alternative release scenario submitted for a 1 ton Chlorine Container with gas feed. This scenario involves the release of Chlorine gas through a 5/16 diameter"

This includes changes in equipment, technology or procedures.\nAll employees involved with the maintenance or operation of the process are notified\npromptly of any changes and offered training on the changes.\n\nPage 3\n\nPre-start up Review\nPre-start up, safety reviews are conducted on any new equipment or changes to existing\nequipment in the Chlorination process. These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, operating and maintenance procedures are correct and understood by all\nemployees involved in the process prior to the start up of any new equipment.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe Verona Pumping Station will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine if the\nprovisions under the PSM rule are being carried out.
