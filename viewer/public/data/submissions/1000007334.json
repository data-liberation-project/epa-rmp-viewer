HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Prevention Program.  These are summarized in Part (d) below.  HTI\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program includes response plans that are coordinated with emergency response activities available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (f) below, is in compliance with the USEPA\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nb.\tHTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad sheets (also called metal clad sheets).  These sheets are eventually processed into computer suspension assemblies used in the hard disk drive industry.  HTI\u00c2\u00bfs Hutchinson, Minnesota, facility uses only one chemical included in the RMP regulations: chlorine.  It is used in etchers for oxidation purposes to improve performance of the etchant.\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition.  The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified metal tanks which are stored in two specially-engineered totally enclosed hold bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1 \u00c2\u00bf ton chlorine tanks (four in each bunker), but only one tank feeds the system at a time.  The liquid chlorine flows from the tanks to a system that converts the liquid to a gas (vaporizer).  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant.  Chlorine is fed into the etchant sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that signal the feed rate.  The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery system contain multiple controls for redund"

An emergency response team is on call 24 hours a day to respond should there be a leak.\n\nc.\tThe off-site consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios called \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfalternate release.\u00c2\u00bf  The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where \u00c2\u00bfthe owner operator shall assume that the \u00c2\u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel \u00c2\u00bf is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to unspecified accident or failure.  This scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is \u00c2\u00bfpassive\u00c2\u00bf (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated).  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario,\u00c2\u00bf but there are no other requirements as to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could potentially be released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario would be one that could reasonably occur (even if it had not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\nHTI\u00c2\u00bfs worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of one chlorine tank contents.  HTI\u00c2\u00bfs alternative release scenario is valve failure in the storage pit releasing one pound of chlorine of which 0.75 pounds is captured and controlled by the scrubber and 0.25 pounds is released to the environment.\n\nHTI\u00c2\u00bfs Hutchinson, MN facility population estimate within the worst-case scenario distance to end points was calculated by using software from the US Census Bureau.
