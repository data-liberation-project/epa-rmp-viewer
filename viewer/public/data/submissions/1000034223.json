      "SummaryText": "Introduction \n\nThe Russell City Energy Center (RCEC) is a 625 megawatt (nominal gross output) natural gas-fired combined-cycle electrical generating facility, with a 230-kilovolt switchyard. The RCEC facility is located at the west end of Depot Road in the City of Hayward, in Alameda County, northwest of the Hayward Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF). \n\nRCEC uses aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent solution) as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere. Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. RCEC stores aqueous ammonia in a storage tank onsite. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps RCEC personnel take to ensure a safely operating plant, and how RCEC personnel handle chemical emergencies. This document complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe RCEC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \n\nThe emergency action plan (EAP) for RCEC details actions to be taken in the event of a release. The City of Hayward Fire Department (HFD) will be the first responders in an ammonia emergency. RCEC personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, RCEC personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. The HFD will handle the release response and mitigation. In the event of a major release, RCEC may join"

This aqueous ammonia storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the CalARP Program and EPA Risk Management Program regulations. The aqueous ammonia process at RCEC is categorized as a Program 1 process under the CalARP Program and EPA Risk Management Program regulations. Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the site as required to support operations and stored in one 15,000 gallon capacity storage tank, filled to 85 percent tank capacity, which is approximately 12,750 gallons total.\n\nThe ammonia storage and transfer system is designed to provide 29.4 percent aqueous ammonia to each HRSG ammonia flow control unit (AFCU). The AFCU vaporizes the aqueous ammonia and then injects the vaporized ammonia upstream of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce NOx emissions.\n\n\n\nAqueous A"

Visitors and contractors must be approved by RCEC staff prior to entry into the facility. \n\nProcess Control. The ammonia storage and transfer system is controlled and monitored via the plant Distributed Control System (DCS). The ammonia process is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. System pressures, temperatures, levels and flow rates are monitored at the main plant control system. The plant control system will initiate preset alarms in the event that system parameters exceed those set points.  \n\nStorage Tank Pressure Relief. The ammonia bulk storage tank is a horizontal, single-wall type equipped with overpressure and vacuum protection. Two 100 percent pressure-relief valves mounted on a three-way valve and two 100 percent vacuum-relief valves mounted on a three-way valve provide the overpressure and vacuum protection, respectively. The three-way diverter valves are able to align any one of the pressure- or vacuum-relief valves for venting and vacuum breaking, respectively. Pressure-relief valve exhaust pipes are routed to a safe height of 10 feet above the access platform.\n\nTank Level Indication. Several tank level alarms are provided on the storage tank. The aqueous ammonia level in the ammonia bulk storage tank is continuously monitored in the DCS, and an alarm is sounded in the control room based on 'low' level, 'low-low' level,, 'high' level and 'high-high' level of the ammonia bulk storage tank, an audible alarm and visual indicating lights are provided in the local control panel for 'high' and' high-high levels'.\n\nSecondary Containment. The ammonia storage tank is located within a concrete area provided with curbing that prevents the discharge of large quantities of aqueous ammonia to the adjacent area due to accidental releases.

      "SummaryText": " curbing also allows aqueous ammonia to flow to the sump located underneath the concrete area. The underground sump is nominally 45 feet long by 18 feet wide by 4 feet high (with a capacity of approximately 20,916 gallons). This volume is sufficient to contain the full contents of the ammonia storage tank plus additional rainfall, as required. Because of the smaller opening  (1 foot by 1 foot) of the sump, the aqueous ammonia remains cool in the underground sump, limiting evaporation of the ammonia.\n\nLeak Detection. Four ammonia leak detectors are provided to sense ammonia vapor. Three detectors are located in the storage tank area and one is installed in the pump skid area. The detectors are monitored and alarmed at the plant control room. The entire ammonia system is visually inspected for leaks on a daily basis.  \n\n\n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nA prevention program is not required for Program 1 processes. However, accident prevention at RCEC is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n?    Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment\n\n?    Monitoring of employee and contractor use of the system\n\n?    Contractor Safety Program\n\n?    Emergency Action Plan\n\n?

(COSCI) is operating a number of similar peaking and base loaded power generation facilities in California. Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the RCEC facility. Operational and safety issues identified at any other COSCI-operated facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites. Additionally, the following will be used to identify and track safety improvements at RCEC.\n\n?    Implementation and revision to safety and training procedures\n\n?
