      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The only material considered hazardous at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Our facility has two 12,000 gallon tanks, equipment for receiving ammonia by truck and equipment for transferring ammonia from storage for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling ammonia.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from the tanks if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the storage tanks to prevent overpressuring and rupture of the tank.\n3. Inspections by independent inspectors to ensure that our equipment is maintained in a manner that ensures safe operation and prevents releases.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures. We have also coordinated with the Port Lavaca Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA. This scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  According to information supplied by the the Fertilizer Institute and the EPA the effect from this scenario would include some residences, but no hospitals, schools, or major commercial areas.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPA\u00bfs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect from such a release would include a few residences, but no hospitals, schools, or major commercial areas."
