The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is ammonia solution >20% concentration (NOT anhydrous ammonia).  This site is not regulated by OSHA Process Safety Management.\n\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping, manufacturing, and storage. This starts with receiving aqueous ammonia in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,500-gallon, carbon steel aboveground storage tank (AST).   Unloading activities are conducted in a coated concrete containment area that will catch any accidental spills. The ASTs are in concrete containment basins that are equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  All tanks, piping and containment areas are constructed and maintained in accordance with Minnesota Rules (\u00a77151) and/or the requirements set forth in the facility's Aboveground Storage Tank Permit (if applicable).  \nPrevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists. Employees are also equipped with proper equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery. \n\nAdherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program. We also follow industry standards, such as those of the National Association of Chemical Distributors to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\n5-Year Accident History:  As a result of our diligence, there has not been an accidental release from ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations,"
