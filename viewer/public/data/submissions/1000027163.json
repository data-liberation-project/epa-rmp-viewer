Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the Benardi Frozen Foods, division of Windsor Foods (Windsor Foods) facility located at 301 West Third Street in Toluca, Illinois, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes changes that include removal of the west refrigeration system engine room and an increase of approximately 3,000 pounds to the overall site inventory of ammonia.  This RMP includes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\n?

Windsor Foods has developed an Emergency Action and Response Plan (EARP) that contains procedures designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nIII.    Facility Identification\n\nThe Windsor Foods facility is located at 301 West Third Street in Toluca, Illinois.  Windsor Foods, Benardi brands is a producer of frozen Italian foods.  The facility has recently removed the west ammonia refrigeration system engine room, which resulted in an overall increase in the total amount of ammonia on-site, specifically in the east (new) engine room.\n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311822.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for processing and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is now one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers and freezers at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system is approximately 23,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia in the refrigeration system has been calculated at approximately 23,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used for cooling in spiral freezers, dock freezers, process freezers and coolers, storage freezers and coolers, and compressor oil cooling.  The refrigeration system consists of five (5) high stage compressors, four (4) low stage compressors, four (4) evaporative condensers, three (3) storage freezer evaporators, three (3) loading dock evaporators, one (1) cooler evaporators, one (1) cheese shredding room evaporator, one (1) filling mix room evaporator, three (3) packing line evaporators, five (5) production line evaporators, one (1) sauce kitchen evaporators, one (1) King make-up air unit, six (6) spiral freezers,"

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nVI.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   \n\n\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules. The next audit of the PSM program will occur by October 13, 2013, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM / Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n\n?    Employee Participation - Windsor Foods has developed a site-specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, and other information required to be developed under the PSM/RMP regulation.
