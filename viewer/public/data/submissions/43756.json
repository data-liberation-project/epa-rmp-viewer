      "SummaryText": "      Our facility is a water treatment plant that uses chlorine for disenfection purposes.  We use 1 ton containers that are kept inside our storage/feeding building.  It has a capacity of 3-1 ton containers.  One container is having gas drawn from it at a time and we normally have at least one container in reserve for standby.   Our chlorine storage/feeding building was completed in 2000 during our plant updating and expansion project.  A chlorine leak detector was installed inside the building at this time.  The detector sensor is mounted near the floor and continuously monitors the air inside the building.  It activates a visible and audible warning at 1 ppm and activates an alarm at 3 ppm.  Besides the visible and audible alarm inside the plant it is also connected to our SCADA system phone dialer.  If the alarm is not acknowledged it will begin calling offsite personnel.  The chlorine building also has a powered vent, a safety glassed entrance door with panicbar on the inside, and light and vent switches located on the outside of building next to the entrance door.  We label the containers as full, in use, standby, or empty for quick identification in case of an emergency.  Our chlorine feed system is vacumn operated and if a line should break it would shut the tank regulator off.  We keep a complete stock of repair parts and maintenance kits for the regulators, rotameters, and chlorine injectors plus a supply of extra tubing.  We test our leak detector and replace the sensor as needed.  New employees are required to read the chlorine manual immediately upon starting work.  During this time they are also taught on site about chlorine handling, safety,  and precautions.  The point that is stressed the most is to never change, unhook, or alter any equipment in the chlorine building  without at least 2 people present.  Training is continual and on going to reduce complacency and instilling the attitude of safety and prevention by educating on the hazards of chlor"

      "SummaryText": "ine.  We keep emergency numbers outside the chlorine building next to the entrance door, in our lab, and in our office both of which are located inside the main facility building.  We keep 2 chlorine repair kits B on hand.  We also have 2 self contained air paks with a spare air tank that we keep filled and tested so that they will be ready for use if needed.  Our facility is inspected yearly by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.  All aspects of our operation are inspected and corrections are made as they are brought to our attention.  We keep an emergency response plan that is updated as needed.  It includes a listing of who does what and additional emergency numbers of personnel to call.  At the present time we have no plans for any upgrades to our chlorine handling process.  I am talking with other area water treatment plants that have switched from chlorine gas to a bleach solution.  I am wanting to learn how it has affected there facility both in chemical handling safety and the financial impact it has had for them.  We have had no accidental releases in the past five years.\nWe have made no changes to our operation in the last five years and at this time we have no changes scheduled for the immediate future\n"
