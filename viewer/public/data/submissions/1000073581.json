KC Midstream is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Catalyst Energy, Inc. (Catalyst Energy).\n\n\n\n<>The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the Risk Management Program & Process Safety Management Program Manual, which details the RMP program requirements as well as how KC Midstream complies with the applicable requirements.  The Endeavor facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\n<>The stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nThe Endeavor facility is located in Hickory Township, Forest County, Pennsylvania.  The facility compresses and processes natural gas to produce pipeline quality natural gas and NGLs.  The natural gas and NGL mixture is comprised of a flammable mixture containing the following regulated substances:\n\n\n\n     Butane [106-97-8];\n\n     Ethane [74-84-0];\n\n     Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl] [75-28-5];\n\n     Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-] [78-78-4];\n\n     Methane [74-82-8];\n\n     Pentane [109-66-0]; and \n\n     Propane [74-98-6].  \n\n\n\n<>The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\n\n\nThe Endeavor facility is required to implement the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.  As such, the Endeavor facility will comply with the requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of flammable or explosive chemicals codified in 40 CFR Part 68.65 thr"
