      "SummaryText": "A.  Hutchinson Technology Incorporated's (HTI) Risk Management Plan involves policies and procedures that integrate technology, engineering, written procedures, and management practices to allow safe operation of the chlorine system.  HTI follows all applicable requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program. HTI's emergency response program includes responses that are coordinated with emergency services available in the community.  The emergency response program, summarized in Part (F) below, is in compliance with the USEPA's Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nB.  HTI uses a chemical process for etching stainless steel and stainless steel/polyimide/copper clad sheets.  The sheets are further processed into micro-electronic components for eventual assembly into computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.  HTI's Eau Claire facility uses only one chemical included in EPA's RMP regulations: chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the facilities etchers to precisely remove stainless steel and other materials during the manufacturing process of micro-electronic components. \n\n\n\nChlorine is supplied to the etching process to maintain the etchant solution (iron chloride) in optimal etching condition.  The chlorine is received as a liquid in DOT specified 1-ton cylinders which are stored in two engineered totally enclosed bunkers (half submerged below ground).  These bunkers can hold a total of eight 1-ton chlorine cylinders (four in each bunker), but only one cylinder is on-line supplying chlorine to the system at a time. The liquid chlorine flows from the cylinder to a vaporizer system that converts the liquid to a gas.  The chlorine gas then flows to the mixing/holding etchant tanks (called sumps) where it enters the solution to chemically maintain the etchant. Chlorine is fed into the etchant sumps in a controlled manner by sensors that signal the feed rate. The storage bunkers, vaporizer, and delivery syst"

HTI maintains a HAZWOPER First Responder \"Technician\" Level trained team and Hazwoper Level B equipment to respond to a chlorine emergency. HAZWOPER trained individuals are on-site 24 hours per day.   \n\n\n\nC.  The off-site consequences analysis includes consideration of two scenarios, a worst case release and an alternate release. The worst case scenario is defined by the USEPA as a scenario where the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified accident or failure.  This scenario does not depend on how or why it occurred and does not depend on whether it has ever been observed to have happened anywhere.  The requirements do not allow for any control of chlorine to be assumed except for a control that is passive (not human, electrical, or otherwise actively activated). The alternative scenario is defined as more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, but there are no other requirements as to defining the quantity released, except that active controls can be included thereby reducing the likelihood of  a release occurring or reducing the quantity that could potentially be released.  Consequently, HTI determined the alternative release scenario would be one that could reasonably occur (even if it has not been observed) and would be one where a chlorine release could be controlled.\n\n\n\nHTI's worst case scenario for chlorine is the release of one full 1-ton cylinder of chlorine over a 10 minute period. HTI's alternative release scenario is a valve failure in the storage pit releasing two pounds of chlorine over a 20 minute period. The RMP*Comp model was utilized to estimate distance to toxic endpoint of both scenarios.   \n\n\n\nD. HTI is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program for chlorine.

The HTI emergency response program is part of a long-established Emergency Management System.  This program includes a HAZWOPER Technician level trained emergency response team, Level B response equipment, decision process, response procedures, and notification plan.

Both are active participants of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  The program also includes emergency response training and procedures for use, inspection, testing, and maintenance of emergency response equipment.
