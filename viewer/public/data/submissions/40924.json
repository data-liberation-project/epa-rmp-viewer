      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe JEA Brandy Branch Generating Station (BBGS) is located at 15701 Beaver Street, Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.   JEA is committed to operating this facility and other JEA systems and facilities in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of JEA and Contractor employees, the public and the environment.  In addition, JEA is committed to operating this and other JEA facilities in full compliance with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory requirements. \n\nTo ensure that the RMP-covered System is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to accidental release prevention, JEA has developed this RMP plan.  Among the important components of this RMP plan are JEA's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility, and JEA's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Facility.  Further discussion on the ERP can be found below. \n\nThe facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe JEA BBGS facility operates one covered process that contains aqueous ammonia (concentration greater than 20%). Aqueous ammonia is stored in two 11,500-gallon tanks.  Since the solution stored in the tanks is 28% ammonia in water and the tank fill limit is 95%, the total inventory of ammonia is 45,992 lbs.  The aboveground aqueous ammonia storage tanks are completely surrounded by a concrete containment dike and ammonia area monitors have been installed. \n\nElectric generating Units 2 and 3 at BBGS each consist of a natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).  The units are equipped with a selective catalytic reduction system (SCR) designed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission from the HRSG to acceptable limits.  A mixture of vaporized ammonia and air is injected into the HRSG\u00bfs flue gas where it reduces the NOx to nitrogen and water upon mixing with the ammonia in the presenc"

      "SummaryText": "e of a catalyst.  The SCR injection process is controlled by the distributed control system (DCS) but can also be manually operated if necessary.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventative Maintenance Program, written Operating Procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for operations and maintenance personnel, and an Incident Investigation procedure. This Prevention Program will ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe BBGS\u00bfs SCR process is a new process and has not had an accidental release of aqueous ammonia within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe BBGS has an Emergency Action Plan in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38.  The current plan has been coordinated with the City of Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department (JFRD) and the Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.  The JFRD is presently responsible for determining when evacuation of off-site areas is necessary and for public notification.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes are specifically identified but regular training sessions and compliance audits will be conducted.  If shortfalls are noted in the compliance audits then an action plan will be developed and areas of improvement will be addressed in a timely manner."
