If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe facility stored and handles anhydrous ammonia for direct sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored and distributed by nurse tanks for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 112,000 pounds in one 12,000 and two 6,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tanktank holding 40,000 pounds. \n\n3. The worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\nNot Listed.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of EPA 40 CFR part 68 \"Accidental Release Prevention,\" ANSI K61.1 \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\" OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfStorage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,\u00bf and Missouri State Fertilizer laws.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\na. There has been one accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years:\nOn the evening of June 7, 2003 vandals opened a riser hose-end valve releasing ammonia.  The motive for the incident was theft.  There was no wind and a vapor cloud formed around the riser and expanded to the roadway east of the facility.  A driver of a passing truck stopped in the vapor cloud.  A following car, not seeing the truck, rammed the truck.  The driver and a passanger in the car were taken to the hospital, treated and released.  The incident was reported to the NRC.  An EPA representative was onsite within two hours.  A report of the accident was filed with the Missouri Highway Pat"

      "SummaryText": "rol.  Three houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure.  The release had been reported to the owner by a passing motorist.  A brother to the owner living closer to the facility was notified, responded to the release and shut the hose-end valve.  It is estimated that approximately 500 lbs of ammonia was released.  In response to this incident, fencing is currently being installed at the facility as a security measure.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe facility has:\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb. Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\nc. Coordinated with local emergency responders.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
