              "Description": "A Process Safety and Risk Management Program (P.S.M.) Manual is implemented at this facility.  The program describes management responsibilities and employee involvement in implementing the requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and 40 C.F.R. 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions for the regulated processes of moving, switching and storing L.P.G. and methanol tank cars.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O.S.H.A.) standard was promulgated to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  \n\nAccording to the Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 68, the U.S.E.P.A. Risk Management Program rule applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a single process (40 C.F.R. 68.10).   Transportation containers used for storage not incident to transportation, and transportation containers connected to equipment at a stationary source are considered part of the stationary source.   Transportation containers that have been unhooked from the motive power that delivered them to the site (e.g., truck or locomotive) and left on site for short-term or long-term storage are also part of the stationary source.\n\nThe R.M.P. regulations require facilities that store a regulated substance in excess of a threshold quantity to do the following:\n\n?    Prepare and submit a notification to the U.S.E.P.A.;\n\n?    Develop a program intended to prevent accidental releases of the regulated substance;\n\n?    Develop and implement an emergency response program or make arrangements with local agencies for emergency response; and \n\n?    Determine the potential impacts on the surrounding community resulting from a worst-case release and from one or more alternative releases. \n\n\n\nThe data submitted to U.S.E.P.A. must be updated every five years or whenever a significant change in the quantity of material stored at the facility occurs.   Swan Ranch certified the R.M.P. submission in May of 2020.  Therefore, the R.M.P. must be updated on or before May 2025.\n\n\n\nThe Swan Ranch facility stores flammable chemicals containing liquefied petroleum gas, a regulated flammable material over the P.S.M. and R.M.P. regulatory threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds.  The O.S.H.A. General Duty Clause and the General Duty Clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments requires all facilities?covered or not?to identify hazards that may result from accidental releases, design and maintain a safe facility and minimize the consequences of any releases that occur.  Therefore, the diesel fuel containing tank cars are also covered by this Program Manual.\n\nThis section describes key responsibilities and activities for ensuring efficient and effective implementation of the P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program to include:\n\n\n\n?    Identification of covered processes;\n\n?    Identification of P.S.M. and R.M.P. staff responsibilities;\n\n?    Development of a schedule for implementing P.S.M. and R.M.P. requirements; and\n\n?    Development of a record and document management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Determination:\n\n\n\nA release from either process would impact a public receptor.  Therefore, the facility does not qualify for Program Level 1.  Propane and methanol are not regulated highly hazardous substances under O.S.H.A.?s P.S.M. (29 C.F.R. 1910.119) Program and are not one of ten N.A.I.C.S. codes specified by the E.P.A.  As stated earlier, the site stores a maximum of 120 propane railcars at 33,700 gallons of propane per car (17,106,120 pounds propane/site) and 3 methanol railcars at 300,000 gallons of methanol per car (789,000 pounds of methanol/site), which are both greater than the threshold limit of 10,000 pounds.  Thus, the storage of propane and methanol in the railcars is a Program Level 2 process. \n\n\n\nAs previously noted, diesel fuel has a flash point of 126?F. Therefore, it is not less than the 100?F P.S.M. and R.M.P. regulatory threshold, but it is listed in the P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program as a best management practice.\n\n",

Development lots from one to 550 acres are provided with utility and rail infrastructure for industrial users.  The facility is located in Cheyenne, WY, where HollyFrontier Corporation (H.F.C.) also operates a refinery.  H.F.C. stores liquid petroleum gas (L.P.G.) and diesel tank cars at the site Swan Ranch facility.\n\n\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O.S.H.A.) standard, 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals requires that employers develop and implement a P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program whenever quantities of the chemicals listed in Appendix A of the standard exceed the recommended thresholds or when the total amount of flammable liquids on site exceed 10,000 lbs.  O.S.H.A. defines flammable liquids as having a flash point of 100?F or less.\n\n\n\nUS Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.E.P.A.) regulation 40 C.F.R. 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions sets forth the list of regulated substances and thresholds, the requirements for owners or operators of stationary sources concerning the prevention of accidental releases and the State accidental release prevention programs.  The list of substances, threshold quantities and accident prevention regulations promulgated under that part also do not limit in any way the U.S.E.P.A. general duty provisions under the Risk Management Planning requirements.\n\n\n\nThe flammable liquids (< 100?F) in the onsite processes, specifically the switching and storage of L.P.G. tank cars, exceeds the 10,000 lbs.

The methanol tank was modeled using pure methyl formate; because, methanol is not listed in the RMP*Comp database and \"Reference for Consequences Analysis\".  Methyl formate was conservatory selected; because, it has the lowest molecular weight compared to other flammable liquids found in Table C-2 and has a lower flammability liquid limit than methanol.  \n\n\n\nSwan Ranch is comprised of a number of separate business operations that this P.S.M. and R.M.P. Program Manual for L.P.G. and diesel railcar transport/storage is intended to cover.  Cheyenne Logistics Hub, L.L.C. (C.L.H.) is the owner of railroad track and land.  Swan Ranch Rail Road, a Division of Watco, is the short line operator.  Granite Peak Trans Loading, L.L.C. functions as the trans-loader of diesel.  To date, there have only been four rail cars of diesel trans-loaded and it is uncertain whether this operation will be continued.  Finally, Cheyenne Rail Hub, L.L.C. (C.R.H.) is responsible for track rental, rail car storage, and potential trans-loading.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the modern, approximately 7,200-acre facility are designed, operated and maintained in full compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAEP); and applicable building and industry codes.  NFPA 30 Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, 2018 was adhered to in the new construction design and building of the regulated processes.  NFPA 30 is part of the International Fire Code, which is widely recognized by state and local inspecting governments.\n\n\n\nProcess and risk safety management systems and procedures are in place to manage changes in process technology, facilities, operating procedures and maintenance procedures in order to provide for continued safe and reliable operations.\n\n\n\nAll employees at the Swan Ranch facility understand that they have the responsibility to protect the environment and to ensure the safety and security of their fellow workers.

It was developed by Granite Peak Development and is part of the Swan Ranch project.  Four thousand acres are located at the southwest intersection of Interstate 80 (I-80) and Interstate 25 (I-25) and the remaining 3,200 acres are located across I-25 to the east.\n\n\n\nC.L.H. operates a large private railroad switchyard that is served by the B.N.S.F. Railway (B.N.S.F.) and the Union Pacific Railroad (U.P.).   The switchyard is adjacent to the B.N.S.F. tracks on the southern end of the property and the U.P. tracks on the west side of the property.  It has a number of feeder tracks.  The High Plains Interchange (I-25 Exit 4) provides main access to the park and is located on the east side of C.L.H.   C.L.H.  may also be accessed from the College Avenue Interchange (I-25 Exit 7).  C.L.H. is platted and zoned for Heavy Industrial (H.I.), Light Industrial (L.I.) and Highway Commercial (H.C.).  \n\n\n\nThe average number of liquefied petroleum gas (L.P.G.) pressurized tank cars stored at the facility is 70, while the maximum is 120.  The average number of methanol liquid tank cars stored at the site is two, while the maximum is three.  The average and maximum diesel non-pressurized tank cars is four.  The L.P.G. DOT112J340W tank cars (33,700 gallons/ load limit 162,400 lbs.) are stored at the site by HollyFrontier Corporation.  The methanol DOT 111A100W1 non-pressurized liquid tank cars have a 30,000 gallon capacity and a 263,000 lbs. gross rail load.  The diesel tank cars are DOT111 or DOT117 "
