This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as, personnel training the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\n\n\nKansas Ethanol has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; Facility Response Plan; and Emergency Action Plan.  Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nKansas Ethanol's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nKansas Ethanol is located in Lyons, Rice County, Kansas.  The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from the natural fermentation of corn.  The regulated substance stored at the facility is limited to a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).  \n\nNote:  Anhydrous Ammonia:  Anhydrous ammonia has been removed during this update.  The ethanol production process has recently been modified to no longer require the use of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Currently the 18,000-gallon aboveground steel Anhydrous Ammonia "

      "SummaryText": "storage tank remains on-site, but it has been emptied and is in the process of being sold and removed off-site.  Therefore, Anhydrous Ammonia has been removed from PSM/RMP planning & reporting.\n\n\n\nWORSE CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant.  Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off site.   Denaturant is stored in a 165,000-gallon steel tank in the facility tank farm.  The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay.  A worst case MSDS was used to determine RMP applicability.  The breakdown of reportable constituents is a part of the determination documentation.  The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 924,000 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Of the entire tank contents, equaling 924,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 314.16 pounds is reportable under CAA Section 112 (r).   RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint, the model results are also a part of the determination documentation.   Public receptor information was obtained using 2014 Census Block data obtained from State of Kansas GIS Data Access & Support Center (DASC).  Public Receptors were limited the employees and contractors of the Jacam Chemicals plant that is across railroad tracks to the east.  No environmental receptors are affected by a worst-case release of denaturant.\n\n\n\nAlternate Scenarios:\n\n1.  Flammable Mixture (Denaturant):  The alternate scenario used for the flammable mixture is the release of 42,000 pounds of natural gasoline due to a tanker truck loadout spill, causing a vapor cloud fire.   The endpoint used was an over pressurization of 1 PSI, a worst-case option.  Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a faci"

      "SummaryText": "lity staff member overseeing loadout operations - therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides.  The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm.   For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint, the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Of the entire tanker contents, equaling 42,000 pounds of the flammable mixture, only 14,280 pounds was used in the RMP Comp model due to the breakdown of regulated constituents under CAA Section 112 (r).  Public receptor information was obtained using 2014 Census Block data obtained from State of Kansas GIS Data Access & Support Center (DASC).  Public Receptors were limited the employees and contractors of the Jacam Chemicals plant that is across railroad tracks to the east. No environmental receptors are affected by an alternate release of denaturant.  \n\n\n\nThe Kansas Ethanol facility could possibly qualify as a Program 2 for remaining RMP process, Flammable Mixture (Denaturant), due to the exemption under PSM rules for flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks.  Plant ethanol processes are subject to PSM as a flammable liquid greater than 10,000 pounds.  However, Ethanol does not have a flammability of 4 in the NFPA fire diamond, therefore is not considered under RMP rules as a flammable liquid.  However, given that the Denaturant and Ethanol processes are located quite close to each other and can share some common piping it would be possible that a release/fire/explosion from one process may affect the other.  Therefore, the facility includes the Flammable Mixture (Denaturant) as a Program 3 for RMP/PSM purposes for consistency and as a best management practice (BMP) throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTIO"

Written weekly and monthly visual inspections are performed and the reports are on file in the Safety Manager's office.  Quarterly leak detection monitoring is performed and reports filed per KDHE requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents associated with RMP covered processes at the Kansas Ethanol facility.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nKansas Ethanol has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including the Health and Safety Plan and Facility Response Plan.  Kansas Ethanol has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility Emergency Action Plan.  The Plans listed as part of this Executive summary have been prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nKansas Ethanol provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.  Any changes to improve safety will be implemented immediately upon discovery of needed changes.  Kansas Ethanol last completed a PSM/RMP Facility Audit on April 19-21, 2016, the next Facility Audit (every 3-years) will therefore be due April 2019.\n\n"
