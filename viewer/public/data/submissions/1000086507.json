The following areas are addressed in this summary\n\n\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n?    Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n?    Hazard Assessment\n\n?    Prevention Program\n\n?    Five-Year Accident History\n\n?    Emergency Response Program\n\n?    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n\n3) California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\n\n\nAmericold is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA/CalARP Risk Management Program. Americold has developed their Risk Management Plan Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) program to include and to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations.   The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report. Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.  State regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Americold interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.  All releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to"

Any release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release.  The General and/or Operation Manager and the Facility Service Manager are to be called if not on site for support. Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General and/or Operation Manager and the Facility Service Manager, if not on site, for instructions.  There are additional full time supervisory and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Supervisor that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis.  They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately to the site management team.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe facility provides process freezing, short-term and long term storage of various food products. The facility is located in an industrial area of Stanislaus County on a contiguous property.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Refrigeration System.  The total ammonia inventory in the process exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.  The refrigeration system is a direct, closed loop, mechanical refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\n\n\nParameters and scenarios of the hazard assessment are included in the report above.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The Prevention Program implemented is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\nKey objectives of Americold's, Modesto Prevention Program are briefly described below.\n\n\n\n1.  Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information.  (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)  \n\n2.     Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation consi"

All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Americold, Modesto.  (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n3.    Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.  (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\n\n4.    Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Americold certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.  (Addressed under Training Element.)\n\n5.    Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  Second, all Americold's, Modesto employees (direct hires, contract) receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees.  (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n6.    Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by the Management of Change Procedure.

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Americold's Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started.  (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\n\n7.    Verification of Americold Logistics compliance with the RMP/PSM program.  This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Americold's personnel. Americold has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find.  (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)\n\n8.
