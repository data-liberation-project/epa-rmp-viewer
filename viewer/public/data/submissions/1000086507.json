All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site.  Small releases can be brought under control immediately.  The emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches for the system with the release.  If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate.  The appropriate shut down switches are identified.  The Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include EPA's Risk Management Plan, OSHA's Emergency Action Plan, OSHA's Process Safety Standard, EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Contingency Plan and Hazardous Materials Plan(HMBP) \u00ac CalARP California Code of Regulation, Title 19 Div. 2 Chapter 4.5\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration systems were thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration systems consisted of a:\r\n\r\n- Series of Safety What-If questions & Checklists; \r\n- Facility inspection.\r\n\r\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup. There has been a designated process safety and compliance manager added to the regional management control structure.\r\n\r\nThis technical assessment was conducted to fulfill the Hazard Assessment (off-site consequence analysis) requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5) for the Americold - Modesto facility."

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Americold's Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.

Any release of more than 25 ppm may result in immediately shutting down the ammonia system depending on the location of the release.  The General and/or Operation Manager and the Facility Service Manager are to be called if not on site for support. Releases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General and/or Operation Manager and the Facility Service Manager, if not on site, for instructions.  There are additional full time supervisory and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Supervisor that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia system on a regular basis.

Americold has developed their Risk Management Plan Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) program to include and to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations.   The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report. Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.  State regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Americold interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.  All releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to"
