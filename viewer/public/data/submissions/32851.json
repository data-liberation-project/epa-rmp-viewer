      "SummaryText": "nexAir, LLC is a distributor of industrial and medical gases and has been in business in Monroe since April of 2000. nexAir, LLC acquired this facility from Greene Welding Supply and the purchase became effective April, 2000. Prior to the date of purchase this facility was, owned by, and doing business as Greene Welding Supply.nexAir, LLC is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of it's employees and the public while complying with all applicable laws and regulations. The only regulated chemical stored at this facility is Chlorine gas. It is stored in 150 lb cylinders. The primary distribution / sales for this gas is to water well facilities in Monroe, LA locale. The worst case scenario is the release of one 150 lb cylinder of chlorine in a 10 minute period. Toxic Endpoint for this type release is .4 miles. The alternate release scenario is the release of one150 lb cylinder of chlorine over an 8 hour period from a .1 square inch hole. Using this type scenario, a greater likelyhood would be that a chlorine cylinder would develop a leak at the valve and slowly leak down over an extended period of time. The Toxic Endpoint for an alternate release scenario is .1 miles. In the event of a leak, the Monroe Fire Department will be notified to respond. The Quachita Parish Local Emergency Planning Commission will be notified in order to inform the public and take precautionary measures to protect public safety."
