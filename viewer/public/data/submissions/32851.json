              "Description": "Chlorine is purchased from Ideal Chemical in Jackson, MS. In 150 lb. containers only.These cylinders arrive in a company-owned tractor trailer. The delivery truck is required to park and chock wheels on the concrete pad in the dock area parking lot. These cylinders are pre-loaded onto steel pallets with side rails. They are secured in place by appropriate straps.Each pallet contains (15) cylinders with approx total weight of 3750 lbs. A forklift with sufficient weight capacity is used to off load these pallets and store in a fenced, secure / well ventilated area behind the main warehouse on northwest side of facility.All shipping papers are checked for verification. A visual inspection and odor inspection is done on all cylinders to detect damaged or possible leaking cylinders.Empty cylinders are stored in this same area and are secured on these steel pallets and readied for shipment to Ideal Chemical Company via their truck.nexAir drivers are required to back their truck up to the fenced area to load chlorine onto nexAir vehicles for delivery to customers.nexAir trucks are designed to transport gas cylinder and drivers are required to secure gas cylinders, in upright position, using heavy straps.Per D.O.T. regulations; proper shipping papers, placarding, labeling and marking are required.All chlorine cylinders are transported and stored with caps for safety and regulation requirements. nexAir company policy does not permit any nexAir employee to remove the cylinder cap, open a valve, hook up or unhook chlorine cylinder at customer facility.Drivers must use the vehicle tailgate for lifting, and appropriate cylinder cart(where applicable) for transporting / loading cylinders.Empty cylinders are handled and transported following same rules and procedures as previously described, and are stored in the steel pallets in the storage area to await pick up by Ideal Chemical Co.",

      "SummaryText": "nexAir, LLC is a distributor of industrial and medical gases and has been in business in Monroe since April of 2000. nexAir, LLC acquired this facility from Greene Welding Supply and the purchase became effective April, 2000. Prior to the date of purchase this facility was, owned by, and doing business as Greene Welding Supply.nexAir, LLC is dedicated to protecting the health and safety of it's employees and the public while complying with all applicable laws and regulations. The only regulated chemical stored at this facility is Chlorine gas. It is stored in 150 lb cylinders. The primary distribution / sales for this gas is to water well facilities in Monroe, LA locale. The worst case scenario is the release of one 150 lb cylinder of chlorine in a 10 minute period. Toxic Endpoint for this type release is .4 miles. The alternate release scenario is the release of one150 lb cylinder of chlorine over an 8 hour period from a .1 square inch hole. Using this type scenario, a greater likelyhood would be that a chlorine cylinder would develop a leak at the valve and slowly leak down over an extended period of time. The Toxic Endpoint for an alternate release scenario is .1 miles. In the event of a leak, the Monroe Fire Department will be notified to respond. The Quachita Parish Local Emergency Planning Commission will be notified in order to inform the public and take precautionary measures to protect public safety."
