The Facility Policy\n\n\tThe owners, management, and employees of Pawnee County (Gray Branch) are committed to the\nprevention of any accidental releases of  anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and\nminimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility information.\n\t-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\t-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\t-The maximum quantity stored would be 84,120  pounds in 1-18,000 gallon storage tank.  The\nmaximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck holding 44,000 pounds.\n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or\ntank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,120 pounds,\nwhich represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design\nstandards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.5 miles.\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely\npotential incident) is a release from a pop off valve.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to\n200 ppm) is .01 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u0013Safety Requirements for the Storage and\nHandling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\u0014, published by the American National Standards I"
