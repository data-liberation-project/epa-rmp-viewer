Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Rhodia, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Sulfuric Acid Manufacturing; Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Manufacturing; Hazardous Waste Incineration; Diphenols Ethers Manufacturing.  We have 10 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Propionitrile  [Propanenitrile], Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-], Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-], Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Carbon disulfide, Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methyl mercaptan  [Methanethiol] and Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-].  Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and is a raw material for dyes and detergents.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a chemical intermediate, refrigerant, bleaching and food processing.  Propionitrile  [Propanenitrile] Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-], Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-],  Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Carbon disulfide,  Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl, Methyl mercaptan  [Methanethiol] , Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer)  [Benzene,"

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and the EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Liquid Sulfur Dioxide Manufacturing.  In this scenario 300000 lb. of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.
