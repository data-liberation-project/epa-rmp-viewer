Our efforts include RMP and PSM implementation, and focus especially on the critical operator day-to-day aspects of accident prevention and emergency response.  Our efforts include training personnel and considering safety in the design installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  The Shackelford Gas Plant is dedicated to continual improvement in these worker and public safety programs.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Shackelford Gas Plant, located in Shackelford, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce products (e.g., natural gas, condensate and natural gas liquids) from natural gas. The Shackelford Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. There are no regulated toxic substances at the Shackelford facility.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank (condensate) containing 29,835 gallons (160,214 lb). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.4 miles. Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Shackelford Gas Plant is a VCE resulting from the release of 9500 gallons (39,641 lb) from a product loading pump. The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the I-psi endpoint for this event is 0.27 miles. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. Figure 1-1 graphically pr"

In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\r\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Shackelford Gas Plant facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Shackelford Gas Plant is coordinated with the Callahan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Shackelford Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Shackelford Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Shackelford Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which may result in modifications to the process.
