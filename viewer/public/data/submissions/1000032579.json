      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Dorcheat Gas Plant\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc., owner and operator of the Dorcheat Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Bonanza's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to Dorcheat for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. Dorcheat inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nA Cryogenic Nitrogen Rejection plant is in place to remove liquids and nitrogen prior to sales of residue gas. The plant is capable of handling 28 MMSCFD.\r\n\r\nGas flow into this facility is at low pressure; approximately 15 psig. Processing and sales line pressures range from 600 to 1000 psig; therefore this gas requires boost compression. Dorcheat has several gas fired engine driven compression units that boost gas pressure up to processing pressure. Gas is treated with Diglycolamine (DGA) to remove CO2 and molecular sieve beads to remove any water that may be entrained in the gas. Cryogenic processing at very low temperatures (down to approximately -260\u00b0F) removes virtually all of the ethane and heavier components and rejects nitrogen.\r\n\r\nDorcheat is designed to remove CO2 from inlet gas with a solution of Diglycolamine and water. Once gas is sweetened, any entrained water is removed using c"

These systems are highly automated and operate with minimal interruptions.\r\n\r\nResidue gas, after liquid removal, is at 5 psig and 285 psig. Gas fired compression units' compress this gas up to sales line pressure and it is sold at the tailgate of the plant. Liquids are stabilized, stored and sold by truck.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary equipment consists of water, amine, lube oil, methanol, antifreeze, and NGL and drain system storage. Dorcheat has air compression systems, instrument air drying equipment, and heat generating systems. This facility is also equipped with a control room, various motor control centers, acid gas vent stack, and finally, a flare system for plant blow down systems.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains three sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; propane refrigerant, plant gas consisting of mostly methane, condensate (pentane), and natural gas liquids. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. Because the processes at the Dorcheat Gas Plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe Dorcheat Gas Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Dorcheat Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Onc"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Dorcheat Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedence for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Dorcheat Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Dorcheat Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Job plans/written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Dorcheat Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. has long-standing safe work practices in place to help e"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nBonanza Creek Energy, Inc. promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.
