Cessco also receives regular courtesy visits from the St. Johns Fire Department as the \nfire department periodically uses Cessco's plant and grounds for the training of their new \nfiremen.\n\nCessco manufactures insecticide aerosols, insecticide liquids, and liquid cleaning products.  \nCessco formulates and fills its own EPA registered products and also contract fills for other \ncompanies.  All products are formulated from EPA approved Confidential Statements of \nFormula.
