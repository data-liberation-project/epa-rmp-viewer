The site consists of a combined cycle facility (CC) and a simple cycle facility (SC). The CC facility consists of 2 units, each containing two combustion turbines, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), one steam turbine, one air-cooled condenser, and their plant support equipment.  The SC facility consists of three single simple cycle combustion turbines. The primary for the CC facility fuel is natural gas with light distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel. The primary fuel for the SC facility is natural gas. \r\nThe CC facility uses anhydrous ammonia to control nitrous oxide emissions while the burning of fuel oil and natural gas for electric power production.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, which is vaporized and mixed with air before being injected into the Selective Catalytic Reduction unit on each HRSG.

A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is performed before each job or task.  If a job cannot be done safely, it is not done.  If a job is safe but has environmental concerns, it is not done. \r\nStandard operating procedures and a preventive maintenance program partnered with the shared values are the backbone of Doswell's prevention program.  All Operation and Maintenance Technicians are required to be qualified on the system before being allowed to work with/on that system.  The operator qualification program defines the knowledge and skill an individual must possess to operate or maintain any given system.  In addition to basic system knowledge, an individual must possess knowledge related to safety, emergency, security, integrated plant operations, and environmental impact as applies to that system.\r\nDoswell utilizes a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).  Preventive maintenance (PM) work orders are issued on a periodic basis established by equipment manufacturers and equipment history.  PM's are used to maintain plant equipment in a good working order and prevent accidental releases due to normal equipment aging.  The CMMS issues and tracks corrective work orders. Premature failures, abnormal operating conditions, releases, safety incidents, and re-occurring corrective work orders are also tracked in the CMMS. \r\nDoswell has procedures and equipment for responding to emergencies in an orderly and safe manner. Emergency plans are utilized to provide guidance and direction in the event of an emergency.  As a part of protecting employee health and safety, Doswell designates itself as a non-responding facility. Facility self-designation as non-responding is recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)."
