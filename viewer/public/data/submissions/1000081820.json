Using the most advanced technology and state of the art equipment is a testimate to this commitment. Continued training of all Operations and Maintenance personnel is a priority, new personnel are trained both by his or her peers in the field and extensive classroom and hands on training held at our facilities. Most of our maintenance personnel are chlorine release first responders.\nEWW is dedicated as well to the community safety as shown by our commitment to remove the use of chlorine gas at our facilities though our Capital Improvements Projects (CIP). EWW currently has under way several projects this year that will remove the use of chlorine gas at many of our facilities, even though these facilities are well below the quantity threshold amount required in the RMP.  EWW has completed several extensive studies on various alternative methods of disinfection for our water supply to insure the safety of residence and populous in areas that are located in close proximity to any of our facilities using chlorine gas for disinfection.\nEWW maintains a very strict and rigid approach to the maintenance of our gas feed and safety equipment. A schedule of checks and inspections as well as a Preventative Maintenance (PM) program on all equipment is a true testament of this as shown by not having a recordable release of chlorine in    years.\n    Erie Water Works hosts and invites local emergency agencies to tour our facilities to familiarize new personal and refresh those who have attended in the past as to the location and procedures to take in the event of a release. We are fortunate to have emergency response personnel located within 12 blocks of our facility. Our facilities have been used as training sites in the past for continued education for first responders in the area.\nTraining\n    EWW believes that training is paramount as shown in o"

EWW also takes pride in making sure that operators and maintenance personnel are trained in the proper operation, use and repair of any new or existing equipment being used at our facilities. Much of the training conducted is held annually, some of the training that is provided to our employees is listed below.\n1.    Confined space training\n2.    Hazardous Communications\n3.    Chlorine Safety\n4.    Chlorine emergency response training(First Responders and leak repair training)\n5.    SCBA  and Level ??A? A??A? suit training\n6.    Factory trained equipment maintenance and repair\n7.    Incident Command training and NIMS 700\nSafety Equipment\nErie Water Works has standardized on Wallace & Tiernan Chlorine vacuum regulators and Chlorine dosing equipment at all locations currently using gas chlorination on 150lb tanks or 1 ton cylinders. These units are inspected 2-3 times per shift anytime the plant is on line by our Operations personnel. In addition, the maintenance department visits each facility when tanks need changed and a once per week safety inspection of all chemical feed facilities in our system. EWW also maintains a type ??A?A??A? or type ??A?B??A? repair kit at each location gas chlorine is used determined by either a 150lb tank or 1 ton cylinder. At each facility where gas chlorination is used we also have several SCBA and level ??A?A??A? suits in case of an emergency release.\n    The use of 1-Ton emergency tank valve shut offs, or ??A?Halogen??A? units as the trade name, on all 4 tanks that are either feeding or in standby at the plant, has given us a better sense of security in the event of a release. These units shut down the chlorine tanks at the vacuum regulator in 2.5 seconds in the event of a release. The level of chlorine in the room is monitored by a Capital Controls sensor that alerts the Halogen units to shut down the tanks if the expo"

EWW has maintained secure areas to each of the locations where chlorine gas is used. At the Chestnut plant the cylinders are located in a locked room with an alarm system that sends an alarm to a monitoring service as well as the operators to rapidly dispatch police or rescue as needed to the plant.\nMaintenance\n    EWW maintains a very proactive PM program on all of the equipment used at our facilities; this is even more rigid when it comes to our chlorination equipment. Each shift plant operators make several inspections on the cylinders at the Chestnut plant. Maintenance also makes a weekly inspection of all our facilities and does a safety inspection that is recorded on a safety inspection check sheet. All chlorine leak detection equipment is checked and calibrated once a month by our technician.\nThe vacuum regulators are taken out of service, rebuilt, and tested every 6 months. The chlorine dosing machines and vacuum injectors are also removed from service, rebuilt, inspected and tested every 6 months. The tygone flexible tubing from the vacuum regulator to our header piping is replaced every 6 months. Our maintenance staff is factory trained on the care and maintenance of all chemical feed equipment. The Halogen units are sent back each year for testing, calibration and certification by the factory.\nOpen Participation\n    Erie Water Works opens its doors and invites safety and rescue personnel into our facilities to review all aspects of our safety and chlorination process. We work openly with our Local Fire, and Police departments as well as our Local LEPC. EWW has invited all of these agencies into our facilities to see firsthand where the chlorination equipment is located, what obstacles that might be in the way of emergency response teams and what we have on hand to respond to a chlorine emergency response.\nEWW has developed Of"

EWW believes that sharing this information with key response agencies and personnel would be a great benefit for saving life, property and the environment in any event of a chlorine release.\n\nConclusion\n    Erie Water works feels it is above the curve in the industry when it comes to chemical feed safety, training, and maintenance of all chemical feed equipment.  We feel that there is no substitution for proper training of our staff and the emergency response agencies in our area.\nThank You\n\nAnthony J. Paligo\nMaintenance Coordinator\n\n"
