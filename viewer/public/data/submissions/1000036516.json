The raw water is clarified, filtered, and disinfected prior to distribution.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the water to make it safe for public consumption and use.  The maximum inventory of chlorine that can be located at the Tri-District Water Facility is 14,000 pounds.  This maximum amount is determined by the  of the chlorine storage room.\n\n\n\nChlorine at the Tri-District Water Treatment Facility is stored and used within a building enclosure that protects the containers, the feed equipment, and the controls.  The building is equipped with ventilation and it is heated during the winter months to maintain proper chlorine feed rates and prevent moisture condensation and corrosion.  Only chlorine gas is withdrawn from the containers during use.  Chlorine gas is fed under vacuum conditions such that any failure in the chlorine feed line shuts off the flow of chlorine gas automatically and no gas leak may occur from the feed line.\n\n\n\nThe Tri-District Water Treatment Facility employs State-certified water plant operators to operate the facility.  These operators receive special training and follow standard operating procedures to provide maintenance on, and operation of, the specialized equipment used for chlorination feed, and chlorine handling and storage.  Industry standards and manufacturers recommendation are followed and documented to assure safe operation of the chlorination equipment.\n\n\n\nIn the five years, preceding September 2013, there have been no accidental release from the covered process (chlorine) at the Tri-District Water Treatment Facility.  In the history of this plant, there has never been an off-site release of chlorine.\n\n"

Appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify the Fire Dept. if there is a need for a response.  The Tri-District Water Treatment Facility employees have written procedures to follow for making the emergency call, securing the plant, and evacuating the facility.\n\n\n\nThe off-site consequences of a worst case scenario chlorine gas release and an alternative release scenario have been evaluated and are on file with the EPA and local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nOngoing and regular training of the water plant personnel in the safe handling and use of chlorine is done to maintain safe and effective use of this chemical."
