Hydrogen chloride is a raw ingredient used as part of the chemical manufacturing process.\n1.5.\tSITE DESCRIPTION (B) (1)\t\nThe site is owned and operated by Montco and is managed Montco staff.  The site is located at 209 Janice Drive, P.O. Box 235, Hollister, Putnam County, Florida.   The 100 acre site is located at the end of Janice Drive.\nThe Plant includes a separate anhydrous hydrogen chloride storage area.\nThe boundaries of the hydrogen chloride system subject to the RMP, and like PSM, regulation include the Bulk Hydrogen Chloride Storage, Feed Control system associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, hydrogen chloride scrubber and hydrogen chloride injection cabinets at the injection point of the product reactor/distillation units.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.6.\tMONTCO RESEARCH PRODUCTS AND ANHYDROUS HYDROGEN CHLORIDE\nMontco uses hydrogen chloride gas in a reaction/distillation process in order to produce 1-Chloromethylnapthalene and Ethyl Benzyl Chloride.  A maximum quantity of 42,000 lbs. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is stored on site in two compressed gas tube trailers.  Each trailer contains seven tubes with a capacity of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  A Risk Management Plan has been developed as required and is maintained in order to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of hydrogen chloride gas from the system.\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public.

In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of hydrogen chloride was determined, and sensitive receptors such as residences were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst case and an alternative case and also compiles the five-year accident history for the hydrogen chloride system.\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two hydrogen chloride release scenarios.  The first is a \u00c2\u00bfworst case release\u00c2\u00bf.  The second is a more probable \u00c2\u00bfalternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \u00c2\u00bfthe operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00c2\u00bf due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \u00c2\u00bfmore likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\u00c2\u00bf.\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the hydrogen chloride released before its concentration decreases to the \u00c2\u00bftoxic endpoint.\u00c2\u00bf  The EPA specified endpoint for hydrogen chloride is 0.030 mg/l.  The endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00c2\u00bf  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \u00c2\u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected.\u00c2\u00bf\n2.1.\tWORST CASE   (C) (1)\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP Comp Program.

There are 242 residences and no other receptors included in that release area.\n2.2.\tALTERNATIVE CASE   (C) (2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the regulator of the pressure system or the wip on pipes/valves connected to one of the one-ton containers.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 0.03 square inch hole in the wip tube, a pipe, or even the container itself.  Modeling using the EPA/RMP Comp and EPA\u00c2\u00bfs water guidance demonstrated the rate of hydrogen chloride release is 100.0 lb. /minutes for a period of 30 minutes releasing a total of 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.

The plant and support equipment of the hydrogen chloride storage area and feed control meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and control area has a natural ventilation system.  The reaction vent scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 3,000 pounds of hydrogen chloride.  This vents to a diesel column vent scrubber.\n3.2.4.\tEquipment Design\nThere is one type of hydrogen chloride pipe system, high pressure.  The high pressure hydrogen chloride piping system is made of hydrogen chloride compatible stainless steel pipes, stainless steel tubes or equipment.  These materials include compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by hydrogen chloride) rated to 1,000 psig.  The maximum pressure of the hydrogen chloride in the high pressure system is 650 psig. There are seven 3,000 pound tube containers on each high trailer.  One tube is in service and the other six are on standby. \nThe system has a nitrogen purge system for both pressure testing and clearing the hydrogen chloride levels.\n \n4.\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (E)\nThe plant has been hydrogen chloride reportable and release free since 1992 to the present, 17 years.
