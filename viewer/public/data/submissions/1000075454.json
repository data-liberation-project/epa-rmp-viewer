Prior to being owned by Crestwood West Coast LLC the fractionator was owned and operated by Inergy Services. Crestwood Midstream Partners merged with Inergy, LP on October 7, 2013. Inergy acquired the North Coles Levee Fractionator on October 1, 2003 and added a new butane isomerization (Butamer) unit to the facility in 2008. The facility is owned and operated by Crestwood Midstream Partners, LLC. Facility operations are covered by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (CalOSHA) regulations in Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), \u00a75189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM). The facility is also subject to the Office of Emergency Service's regulations in Title 19 CCR, \u00a72735, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). This is a Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) and CalARP Program Level 3 process for flammables. \r\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Aqueous Ammonia System at the North Coles Levee Facility in July, 2005. The Aqueous Ammonia System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations \u00a72755, CalARP Program. This is a CalARP Level 2 process. The prevention program described below has been implemented. \r\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System at the North Coles Levee Facility in 2008.

The worst-case flammable scenario is based upon a release of 15 million gallons of butane. \r\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator operates 24 hours per day receiving natural gas from surrounding production fields. Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are recovered from the natural gas through a refrigeration process. The remaining natural gas is sold to Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulated utility companies for home use. NGL's are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses. This facility has the ability to remove hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming liquid deliveries. In the summer, the facility receives and stores liquid propane to be used as winter fuel in refrigerated storage tanks. \r\nDuring 2008, Crestwood (as Inergy) started construction of a new butane isomerization (Butamer) unit at the North Coles Levee Facility, and an updated RMP was submitted in January, 2009. The Butamer converts normal butane (n-butane) into iso-butane. The conversion of n-butane to iso-butane is accomplished catalytically in the presence of hydrogen. This submittal is the 5-year resubmission of the January, 2009 plan.\r\nMidstream currently operates two cogeneration units, both of which utilize a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System and oxidation catalyst to reduce oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. The system utilizes aqueous ammonia, which is mixed in dilution air in a vaporizer tower, vaporized, and directed to the reactor where it is injected upstream of the catalyst bed. \r\nMidstream also utilizes a refrigeration system for the treatment and/or storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids, which contains approximately 1150 p"

The program includes the following elements: Offsite Consequence Analysis, Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-job Start-up Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, and Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits. The anhydrous ammonia system has been incorporated into the Plant Process Safety Management Program.\r\nMidstream maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies. Midstream has a Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department, which is the Certified Unified Program Agency for Kern County.\r\nTraining includes employee responsibilities in the PSM and CalARP programs, emergency response, hot work permit procedures, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures. \r\nThe process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shut off valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and containment area. \r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\r\nThe Butamer unit and anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system are the newest processes, with operation commencing in 2009 as part of an expansion of the North Coles Levee Facility.

In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate on of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 911, and secure the area. The 911 system is used to notify the Fire Department. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\t\r\nMidstream maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.

This commitment is demonstrated by maintaining the implementation of the process safety requirements already in place. Furthermore, the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design during construction and installations, is an investment in good business practices. Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable release. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release."
