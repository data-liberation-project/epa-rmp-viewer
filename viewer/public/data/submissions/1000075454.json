The prevention program is based on 40 CFR 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735.  It covers all processes within the facility involving the storage and handling of flammable liquids and gases.  The program includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  All Visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management compliance audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis.  Training includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, emergency response, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.",

It covers all processes within the facility involving the storage and handling of flammable liquids and gases.  The program includes the following areas: Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Evaluation, Contractors and Visitor Orientation, Pre-Job Start-Up Review, Mechanical Integrity, Code of Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permit, Confined Space Entry, Control of Hazardous Energy), Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Emergency Planning and Response, and Compliance Audits.  All Visitors onto the property must undergo a site safety orientation and check in prior to each visit.  Planned changes to improve safety have been established based on compliance with the process safety management compliance audits and revalidation of the process hazard analysis.  Training includes employee responsibilities in the process safety management program, emergency response, hotwork permit procedure, code of safe work practices, and operating procedures.",

Prior to being owned by Crestwood West Coast LLC the fractionator was owned and operated by Inergy Services. Crestwood Midstream Partners merged with Inergy, LP on October 7, 2013. Inergy acquired the North Coles Levee Fractionator on October 1, 2003 and added a new butane isomerization (Butamer) unit to the facility in 2008. The facility is owned and operated by Crestwood Midstream Partners, LLC. Facility operations are covered by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (CalOSHA) regulations in Title 8, California Code of Regulations (CCR), ?5189, Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials (PSM). The facility is also subject to the Office of Emergency Service's regulations in Title 19 CCR, ?2735, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). This is a Federal Risk Management Program (RMP) and CalARP Program Level 3 process for flammables. \n\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Aqueous Ammonia System at the North Coles Levee Facility in July, 2005. The Aqueous Ammonia System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations ?2755, CalARP Program. This is a CalARP Level 2 process. The prevention program described below has been implemented. \n\nCrestwood (as Inergy) installed the Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System at the North Coles Levee Facility in 2008. The Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigeration System is regulated by Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2755 CalARP Program. This is a CalARP Level 2 process.

The worst-case flammable scenario is based upon a release of 15 million gallons of butane. \n\nThe North Coles Levee Fractionator operates 24 hours per day receiving natural gas from surrounding production fields. Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) are recovered from the natural gas through a refrigeration process. The remaining natural gas is sold to Public Utility Commission (PUC) regulated utility companies for home use. NGL's are fractionated into propane, butane, iso-butane, normal butane, and gasoline components for a multitude of industry uses. This facility has the ability to remove hydrogen sulfide that may be present in incoming liquid deliveries. In the summer, the facility receives and stores liquid propane to be used as winter fuel in refrigerated storage tanks. \n\nDuring 2008, Crestwood (as Inergy) started construction of a new butane isomerization (Butamer) unit at the North Coles Levee Facility, and an updated RMP was submitted in January, 2009. The Butamer converts normal butane (n-butane) into iso-butane. The conversion of n-butane to iso-butane is accomplished catalytically in the presence of hydrogen. This submittal is the 5-year resubmission of the January, 2009 plan.\n\nMidstream currently operates two cogeneration units, both of which utilize a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System and oxidation catalyst to reduce oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. The system utilizes aqueous ammonia, which is mixed in dilution air in a vaporizer tower, vaporized, and directed to the reactor where it is injected upstream of the catalyst bed. \n\nMidstream also utilizes a refrigeration system for the treatment and/or storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids, which contains approximately 1150 p"

In the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate on of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 911, and secure the area. The 911 system is used to notify the Fire Department. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM    \n\nMidstream maintains an emergency response plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.
