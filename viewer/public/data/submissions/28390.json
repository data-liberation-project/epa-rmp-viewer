      "SummaryText": "U. S. Amines uses a variety of raw materials including anhydrous ammonia and ethylamine to produce several amines including allylamine within its Amines Plant operations at the Portsmouth, Virginia site.  Anhydrous ammonia, ethylamine, and allylamine are stored in 30,600 gallon, 44,900 gallon, and 20,800 gallon tanks, respectively.   The maximum quantity of each substance stored on-site exceeds 10,000 pounds.  Because of this, the facility is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program regulation.   For each regulated substance, a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario were evaluated to estimate potential impacts to the surrounding offsite area in the event of an accidental release.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is based on the failure of the 30,600 gallon ammonia storage tank when filled to the greatest quantity allowed (75% of capacity).  The ammonia cloud formed from a worst-case release event would reach offsite areas and nearby public receptors.  The alternative release scenario considered is based on a transfer hose failure containing ammonia.  In this scenario, the ammonia cloud would reach offsite areas and could reach nearby public receptors depending on prevailing wind conditions at the time of the accidental release.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for ethylamine is based on the failure of the 44,900 gallon tank storage tank when filled to the greatest quantity allowed (85 % of capacity).  The released ethylamine is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion, which would affect offsite areas and  nearby public receptors.  The alternative release scenario for ethylamine is based on a piping failure.  Similar to the worst-case scenario, the ethylamine released in the alternative scenario is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion, which would affect offsite areas and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for allylamine is based on the failure of a 20,800 gallon allylamine storage tan"

      "SummaryText": "k when filled to the greatest quantity allowed (90% of capacity).  In the event of an accidental release from the tank, the allylamine will be spilled into a 3,900 square foot diked area, which will mitigate the release.  The allylamine cloud formed from a worst-case release event would reach offsite areas and public receptors.    The alternative release scenario considered is based on a piping failure in the allylamine transfer line, which connects the process area to the product storage tank area.  In this scenario, the allylamine cloud would reach offsite areas and nearby public receptors.\n\nDuring the past five years, the U. S. Amines facility in Portsmouth has not had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, ethylamine, or allylamine that caused injuries, property damage, or environmental damage.  Also, the facility complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) provisions.  Mitigation measures and procedures have been established by Celanese to minimize the potential for accidental releases and to minimize offsite impacts in the event of an accidental release of a hazardous substance from the facility.  These measures include required staff training in operational safety issues, on-going preventative maintenance for the process equipment, and established emergency response procedures including coordination with local emergency responders and notification of the public."
