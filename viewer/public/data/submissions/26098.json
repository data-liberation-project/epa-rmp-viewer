If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to the population and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  Farmers Union Coop currently has four full time employees.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and store while awaiting delivery to the farmers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia store at this facility is approximately 190,900 pounds.  This amount includes our main storage tank, nurse tanks and a semi-trailer.  During periods of non operation, of this facility,  local law enforcement and our personnel conduct inspections a various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Anything out of the ordinary is reported to our 24 hour number and appropriate action is taken.\n\nThe major hazards identified in section 8.4.c, fire and explosion, would be from the propane dealer located adjacent to our facility.  There has been coordination between our facility and the owners of the propane facility as to what actions to take in the event of a release from either facility.  \n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our main storage tank.  The quantity released would be approximately 52,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 2.6 miles.\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The altrnative-case release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.4 miles.\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-6"

Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR Part 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program:  Our facility has coordinated with the local responders and we do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.\n\n8.  Planned Changes To Improve Safety:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at our facility.  Periodic evaluations are performd to assess our prevention and safety programs.   No changes are planned at this time.\n\n9 For additional Information Contact:\n\nMr. John Steenson\nFarmers Union Coop\n300 Railroad Street\nWolbach, NE  68882\n(402) 246-5221"
