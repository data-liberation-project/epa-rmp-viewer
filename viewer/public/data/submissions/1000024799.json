This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant facility site is located at 1836 Shada Avenue, Baton Rouge, LA in East Baton Rouge parish. The plant produces synthetic rubber, and uses or produces relatively few regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantities: butadiene (flammable); and ammonia and acrylonitrile (toxic substances).\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nNOTE: Although we have numerous controls to prevent unplanned releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating worst-case scenarios for toxic or flammable substances.\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the plant is a catastrophic failure of an acrylonitrile tank, resulting in a release of 160,000 lbs of acrylonitrile. The maximum distance to a toxic endpoint for this WCS is 11 miles.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for acrylonitrile is a pipe rupture during an unloading operation, resulting in a release of 3,400 lbs of acrylonitrile over a 30-minute period. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.3 mile.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a pipe break at the storage tank, resulting"

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint for this ARS is 0.3 mile.\n\n\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butadiene. The full tank inventory of 1,400,000 lbs is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.9 miles.\n\n\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from release of approximately 5,000 lbs of butadiene resulting from the failure of a pump seal over a period of 10 minutes. The release is expected to be detected and isolated by the operators within a maximum of 10 minutes (active mitigation). The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.1 mile.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Baton Rouge plant. Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant encourages employee participation in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant. In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process saf"

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees have access to any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards such as those associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for applicable process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted by a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Baton Rouge plant updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results at least once every 5 years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant maintains written procedures that address v"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training both in safety issues and in plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is typically paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. Operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least once every 3 years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment. Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules, and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR team uses checklists to verify and document all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are\n\nproperly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or Management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Baton Rouge plant incorporates quality assurance measures (e.g., purchasing specifications and inspection procedures) into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Baton Rouge plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n--Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n\n\n--Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n--Valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n--Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n--Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n--Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g, uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\n--Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n--Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n--Deluge systems for specific equipment\n\n--Trained emergency response personnel\n\n--Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Baton Rouge plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.
