Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source\nPatriot Mining Company, Inc. has policies and procedures that have trained their employees in the safe handling storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees are also trained in emergency response procedures to prevent and/or mitigate the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia at this facility.\n\nThe equipment used in the transportation, storage and use of anhydrous ammonia conform to the appropriate federal and state regulations dealing with this material.  Equipment and maintenance records are kept on site.  Patriot Mining Company uses qualified third party contractors to transport anhydrous ammonia to this facility.  Independent safety consultants provide additional training in safety and emergency procedures for Patriot Mining  Company employees.\n\nPatriot Mining Company has coordinateed its emergency response procedures with the local LEPC.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThere is one stationary source covered by the Risk Management Plan.  The regulated substance anhydrous ammonia.  The tank has a capacity of 12,000 gallons.  The tank is never filled to a volume greater than 85% of total capacity.\n\n3.  Worse Case and Alternative Scenarios including Administration Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit Discharge Distances\n\nPatriot Mining Company has performed a hazard assessment of its operations and determined that the worse case scenario release for anhydrous ammonia would result from the catastrophic failure of the storage tank filled to 85% of capacity,  For this worse case scenario discharge no administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the anticipated toxic endpoint of the regulated material.  The RMP Comp program was used to determine toxic endpoint data in the worse case scenario.  The worse case "

For the alternative release scenaio, Patriot Mining Company considered the effects of passive mitigation sustems such as the excess flow valves and the active mitigation measures initiated by employees monitoring the amterial transfer that will limit the duration and amount of material release to columes below the capacity of both the tanker and storage tank.  These actions will reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario to 0.4 miles radially from the source, according to the RMP*Comp program.\n\n4.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe storage tank is equipped with passive mitigation devices.  Excess flow valves are designed to prevent the rapid loss of regulated material through piping.  The build-up of excess pressure is released through pop-off valves.\n\nTransfer operations between bulk trucks and storage tanks are monitored by trained personnel.  Employees and contractors have been trained as to the proper handling and hazards of anhydrous ammonia.  Storage containers are properly labeled and hazard warnings are posted.  Employees working with anhydrous ammonia have been provided with the appropriate personal protective equipment.\n\n5.  Five Year Accident History\n\nAn estimated 6,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia was accidentlly release during an incident June 29, 2004.  The cause of the release was determined to be human error.  There were no injuries or death resulting from this incident. \n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of a repor"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of the 12/16/04 compliance audit, Patriot Mining Company, Inc. will post written operating and emergency procedures at the field location of the storage tank.  Also, the truck used in the transfer of the ammonia has been parked and this procedure is no longer being utilized.  The tanks are being filled through the independent contractor supplying ammonia to the site."
