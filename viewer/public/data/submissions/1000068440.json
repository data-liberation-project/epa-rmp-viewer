As part of this commitment, ARC has established a system to help ensure the safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at ARC.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program implemented by ARC.\r\n\r\nARC's risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n1.  A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.5.\r\n2.  A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4.\r\n3.  An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk management program at ARC helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the mill.  In fact, ARC has implemented a comprehensive safety program and established many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and d"

      "SummaryText": "amage from a release of a hazardous substance. \r\n\r\nARC utilizes engineer and administrative controls to reduce the possibility of releases of hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nARC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  ARC trains employees to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In the event of an accidental release, the mill's Emergency Response Team will work with local emergency responders to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized.\r\n\r\nThe safety program at the mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at ARC that are required by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nARC is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the mill; and programs to evaluate the hazards at ARC.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, ARC controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire dep"

In order to effectively implement these policies, ARC established a management system headed by the Environmental Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\r\n\r\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\r\nARC operates two bleached kraft pulp mills that employ approximately 430 full-time workers.  The two mills produce bleached kraft market pulp for sale to customers.  As part of this manufacturing process, ARC handles chlorine dioxide in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.\r\n\r\n1.3  Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nARC performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  ARC does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenario was selected to help the Monroe County Emergency Management Agency improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like ARC, and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.  \r\n\r\n1.4  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nSince its inception in 1978, the facility has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for the Kraft Pulp Bleaching process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention programs for chlorine dioxide.  In 1996, the EPA's RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of ARC's Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA's RMP rule accident pre"

The PHA is conducted by a team consisting of a minimum of an engineer with knowledge of the process, an experienced operator, and a facilitator with knowledge of the PHA methodology. The team evaluates the process and reviews the potential hazards of different scenarios. Any hazard with unacceptable residual risk is given a recommendation to reduce the risk down to an acceptable level. These recommendations are assigned a primary person responsible and a due date for required completion. \r\n\r\n1.4.3  Operating Procedures\r\nARC engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as the foundation for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Mill employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\r\n\r\n1.4.4  Training\r\nARC trains employees to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The employee training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.
