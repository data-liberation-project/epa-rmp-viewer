      "SummaryText": "The Warren WWTP stores and uses Chlorine to disinfect treated wastewater effluent as it leaves the plant.  The Chlorine is stored in a separate enclosed building divided into two sections.  Both sections are equipped with stationary chlorine detectors connected to alarms on our Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to notify staff of a chlorine leak should one occur.  The standard amount of chlorine stored is 2500 pounds or less.  During heavy rains we store and use more chlorine (it is possible to have up to 6000 pounds on site).  As a result of the use of chlorine for the disinfection process at the plant, the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management requirements and has developed a Process Safety Management Plan.  Through this plan, Plant staff has worked together to develop the necessary expertise, judgment, training and initiatives to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program for the chlorination disinfection process.  A systematic approach was taken to evaluate the entire chlorination process, including operational and maintenance activities, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, evaluation of the physical plant and equipment and review of training programs and procedures. The Plant's Process Safety Management Program has been instrumental in assuring our ability to prevent and control chemical accidents.  Only one accident has occurred in the past five years.  As a result of our comprehensive response plan, the release that occurred was quickly stopped by the first responder with no off-site consequences.  The Macomb LEPC has a written Emergency Response Plan to deal with a chlorine leak at the Plant, which includes a plan for evacuation of residents in the affected area.  Only a single one-ton cylinder is connected to the treatment plant disinfection process during normal conditions.  A worse case scenario release of all of the Chlorine (2000"

      "SummaryText": " Pounds) would affect approximately 12,000 residents living around the Plant with procedures for their immediate evacuation if necessary.  Chlorine sensors would detect a leak, immediately alerting staff by sounding an audible alarm and sending a computer alarm simultaneously.  Plant personnel would respond by notifying the Macomb LEPC and the Warren Fire Department to initiate the Facility Emergency response Plan which includes specific procedures for off-site authorities to respond to a release incident resulting in bringing in Warren's HAZMAT team, who has been trained as our first responder to enter the building and stop a chlorine leak.  In the event of a release, the Warren Fire Department has been established as the lead agency to assume the role of Incident Command.  Under the established plan, support agencies will respond and act in accordance with their pre-determined roles, i.e.:  Law enforcement (traffic / access control) etc..  Incidents that require medical response will be handled in accordance with OSHA standards and Macomb County Medical Control Board protocols.  The Plant's process safety management program was implemented chiefly to insure that procedures and training are in place to prevent a chlorine release from occurring.  The elements of the Warren WWTP response program which include, coordination with local emergency responders, personnel safety training, public notification and alert procedures, as well as simulation exercises and other training for response personnel are in place to assure employee and public safety in the rare event that a release should occur."
