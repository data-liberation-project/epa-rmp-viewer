Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Atlanta Foam Plant, as part of the Woodbridge Group of companies, believes the health and safety of its employees and the protection of the natural environment, is the utmost concern in the operation of its business.  We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\nComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.\nReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental  improvements.\n\nOur complete Heath Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility. \n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. Our Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Plant Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Plant Manger, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule. \n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Atlanta Foam Plant is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry. The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals as they are poured into"

Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, vacuum or mechanically crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers. \n\nToluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA's risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck, and is stored in 2 tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 210,000. pounds.\n\n3. Off-site consequence analysis scenarios \n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenario's for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.  \n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint as established by the RMP rule was  ALOHA. \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario.\nCatastrophic failure of a railcar full of TDI at the railcar unloading site, discharging its entire contents of 180,000 pounds in 60 minutes, using the ALOHA model. It is assumed that the maximum temperature the TDI could reach during an unload is 120 degrees F. As there is no containment at the railcar unloading site, it is assumed that a pool with a depth of 1 cm is formed,covering 80,000 sq. ft. and evaporates to form a cloud that disperses downwind. The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/l is 0.12 miles, or 217 yards. There are no residences within this boundary.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario. \nAn accidental railcar movement that severs a 25-ft le"

The distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.007 mg/L is .04 miles or 86 yards.

As our LEPC and SEPC are one and the same, we have coordinated our program with the local fire department. A representative group from the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medical treatment for exposure to TDI.\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAt this time we are continuing to maintain our current safety management systems.
