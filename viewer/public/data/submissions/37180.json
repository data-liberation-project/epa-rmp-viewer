      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIowa Cold Storage has an emergency action plan in effect that was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n    1.)    To save lives.\n    2.)    To minimize and avoid injuries.\n    3.)    To protect the environment.\n    4.)    To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nIowa Cold Storage is a new facility as of late 2003, prior to December 2003, the facility operated a small ammonia refrigeration system that was not applicable to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation. The facility is planning to add ammonia in January 2004, which will require the facility to comply with the Program Level 3 of the EPA RMP.\n\nThe refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 12\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total ammonia inventor"

      "SummaryText": "y is 13,000 pounds.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Summary\n\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel.  The largest vessel, High Pressure Receiver, is located inside the engine room and has a maximum capacity of 8,877 pounds.  This quantity was released in 10 minutes.  This vessel is located outside; therefore, passive mitigation was not considered. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The facility is located in an rural setting.  The downwind distance was determined using Exhibit 4-4 from the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", May 2000.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nThe alternative release scenario was that of a 0.75 inch diameter leak of high pressure gas ammonia for one hour.  This scenario was chosen because the facility has a 0.75 inch ammonia gas line that is located outside the building. The quantity of ammonia released in one hour at this rate is 3,180 pounds.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters/second wind speed, and D stability. The facility is located in an rural setting.  The downwind distance to 200 ppm was determined using Exhibit 4-5 from the EPA \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", May 2000.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Controls\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\n? IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie-ins\"\n? I"

IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\"\n? IIAR Publication R-1, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nIn addition, Iowa Cold Storage has implemented a Process Safety Management program for compliance with the OSHA 1910.119 regulation.\n\nEngineering Controls\nThe facility is equipped with a state-of-the-art ammonia detection system. There are ammonia sensors located in the engine room and the pressure relief header. The ammonia detection system will start the emergency ventilation system. The facility can access the liquid and hot gas solenoid King valves remotely through the computer control system. There is an emergency shut off switch located outside the engine room to shut down the entire system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility is new as of late 2003, therefore, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has established an action plan in the event of an emergency which could include an ammonia release, blackout, fire, earthquake, etc.  The facility does not respond to releases of ammonia; therefore, the action plan is similar to that of a fire - evacuation the building and notify the appropriate responders. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Safety Management team is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for the Iowa Cold Storage employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety au"
