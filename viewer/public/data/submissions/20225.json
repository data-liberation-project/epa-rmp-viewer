Fountain, MN,\n\n1.The Facility Policy\n\n          The owner and employees of Eickhoff Fertilizer INC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n           The pimary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers.\n\n            Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n            The maximum quantity stored would be 260,000 pounds in three tanks- 8000,12000,30000 gallon storage tanks. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n             a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles.\n\n             b. The alternative release scenario based on a 2 minute release from a break in a 3 inch pipe. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention propram.\n\n             The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhyrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, MN Dept. of Agriculture Ammonia rules.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n             \na. There have been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that;\n             - ha"
