Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nAt the Kaneka Texas Pasadena facility, there are five chemicals covered by the EPA?s RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68).  They are: Acrylonitrile, 1-3 Butadiene, Chlorine, Butanes and Propylene Oxide.  It is vital to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of ourselves, our co-workers, our contractors, the community and our environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these chemicals combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of our facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use to train our personnel.\nThe facility maintains an emergency response plan that defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures.  Drills and exercises are routinely conducted to test the facility?s plans and revise the plans if necessary. \nThe emergency response plan also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, including emergency response personnel, the local Channels Industry Mutual Aid (CIMA) agency, the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) organization and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \nB.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\nKaneka Corporation engages in the manufacturing of synthetic resins, plastic products, chemicals and electrical raw materials and synthetic fibers. Its products include MBS (modifier resin) resin, used to improve the shock, weather, and heat resistance of various"

Two units, Modifiers and Eperan, are operational.  The third, Chlorinated-polyvinylchloride (CPVC), is under construction with an expected startup date in early 2008.  The final unit, Modified Silicones (MSA), is still under design and has a proposed startup date of 2009.  This RMPlan includes all four units as the quantities, process conditions and locations of all covered chemicals are known at this time.  \n \nThe Modifiers unit handles two RMP-covered chemicals: \n?  1, 3-Butadiene (flammable) with a maximum inventory of 301,000 lbs; and\n?  Acrylonitrile (toxic) with a maximum inventory of 132,000 lbs.\nThe primary purpose of the butadiene and acrylonitrile are as raw materials to create a polymer which is blended with plastics, such as PVC, for impact improvement, as well as applications for window frames and siding.\nThe Eperan unit handles one RMP-covered chemical: \n?  Butanes (flammable) with a maximum inventory of 56,400 lbs.\nButanes are used to expand polypropylene and polyethylene beads which are then used in molding applications.\nCPVC handles one chemical: \n?  Chlorine (toxic) with a maximum possible inventory of 180,000 lbs.\nChlorine is reacted in a water slurry with the PVC.  The resultant CPVC powder is conveyed to railcar for shipping.  CPVC is used in the manufacturing of hot water plastic pipes.  \nMSA handles one chemical:\n?  Propylene oxide (toxic) with a maximum possible inventory of 220,500 lbs.\nPropylene Oxide (PO) is brought onsite by tank truck and reacted with other organic chemicals to make a modified silicone liquid.  The end product is used in the manufacturing of sealants.\nThe Pasadena facility is equipped to safely unload tank trucks and railcar"

      "SummaryText": "rds Analyses have been conducted on processes containing all four RMP-covered chemicals.  Major hazards identified include fire, explosion, toxic chemical releases, overpressurization, overfilling, and equipment failure.  Process controls in place include relief valves, emergency and automatic shutdowns, grounding, interlocks and procedures and training.  Additionally, Acrylonitrile, Chlorine and Propylene Oxide storage are contained within dikes with appropriate drainage and fire protection.  Fire protection is also provided for areas containing the flammables Butane and 1, 3-Butadiene.  \nTraining is conducted continuously and includes classroom, on-the-job mentoring and standard operating procedure (SOP) reviews.  Testing and demonstration are used as means to verify understanding.  SOPs are kept evergreen through a continuous review and revision process that is managed by designated individuals in each process unit.\nThe site has both predictive and preventative maintenance programs which include inspections, tests and routine maintenance activities that are performed by trained and competent employees and contractors.  Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.  There is a system in place to correct identified deficiencies.  Additionally, there is a quality assurance program in place which reviews individual workmanship as well as new and spare parts.\nChange is managed through a management-of-change (MOC) process.  The MOC process outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before they startup.  Additionally, changes undergo a pre-startup safety review conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility?s Pre-startup Safety Review procedure.\nA PSM and RMP compliance audit was conducted in October, 2007.  Findings were discussed with the facility?"

      "SummaryText": "s management team and personnel were assigned to correct noted deficiencies.  The expected completion date of all action items resulting from the audit is July, 2008.\nThe facility has an active accident / incident prevention program.  Each incident and near miss associated with the process area is evaluated and, if it meets pre-defined criteria, a team-based investigation is performed.  The investigation?s purpose is to identify root and contributing causes and to make recommendations to prevent future recurrence.  The facility?s safety department tracks investigation action items through until closure.\nEmployees are active in all aspects of process safety, including safe work permitting, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, mechanical integrity and management of change.  Additionally, contractors are involved in many aspects of the programs.  \nKaneka screens contractors based on safety performance before they are allowed entrance to the facility.  Employees responsible for projects involving contractors are encouraged to provide feedback to both management and the contractor on the contractor?s overall safety performance.\nE.  Five-year accident history:\nThe Kaneka Texas Pasadena Facility has never had, in the history of the facility, any release that reached beyond the property line or resulted in deaths on site, injuries or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\nF.  Emergency response program:\nThe facility maintains an emergency response plan that defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures."
