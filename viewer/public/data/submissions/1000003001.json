      "SummaryText": "BGC Ice/Freezer Plant is a processing plant owned and operated by Brookshire Grocery Company in Tyler, Texas. BGC Ice/Freezer uses Anhydrous Ammonia to keep products at federal mandated temperature levels and there is approximately total of 45,700 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia on site. BGC Ice/Freezer has not had a reportable release of Anhydrous Ammonia in more than thirty years. The entire facility is located behind an eight-foot security fence with A\u00bfauthorized personnelA\u00bf access only to and from premises. Armed security personnel guard the entire facility, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. BGC manufacturing maintenance department has over 100 years of combined experience with Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n Maintenance personnel responsible for the ammonia system are trained every year in the proper technique of wearing emergency response equipment such as  SCBA, Ammonia Respirators, Level A Suits, and other required PPE In Accordance With (IAW) OSHA 1910.134. BGC Dairy and Brookshire Grocery Company maintain close ties with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), Tyler Fire Department, and their Hazmat Team. Annually BGC Ice/Freezer conducts tours for these organizations to maintain familiarity with the facility. The Tyler Fire Department and their Hazmat Team have both recognized the experience that BGC Ice/Freezer personnel have in respect to Anhydrous Ammonia response and have requested that the Hazmat Team backup BGC Ice/Freezer personnel in the event of an ammonia release. In addition, all on site partners receive training and conduct rehearsals in emergency evacuation annually. All new partners receive training in emergency evacuation and ammonia awareness during the new partner orientation process.\r\nBGC Ice/FreezerA\u00bfs  ammonia equipment is in an enclosed room that vents to the atmosphere. All piping is routed to the roof so that if there were a Pressure Release Valve (PRV) discharge, the release will be outdoors. All piping from our pressure relief valves are"

      "SummaryText": "tied into main headers that have been routed to the roof and placed an additional twenty feet in the air IAW ANSI/IIAR 2 1999 7.3.2. An \"Emergency Anhydrous Ammonia Control Box\" is located outside the building, but within our facility, that would allow A\u00bfAuthorized PersonnelA\u00bf to shut down the system in the event of a major release. BGC Ice/Freezer has implemented and continues to conduct an aggressive, preventative maintenance program, IAW IIAR Bulletin 110, to ensure that all hazards are addressed to reduce the risk of an Anhydrous Ammonia release.\r\nIn the event of a suspected release of Anhydrous Ammonia BGC Ice/Freezer has a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan and Emergency Response Contingency Plan in place. This plan receives annual updates, or when deemed necessary by Management or the Environmental Health and Safety Coordinator. The plan is designed to protect our partners and our community. BGC Ice/Freezer, Supervision, Security, LEPC, Tyler Fire Department, and their Hazmat Team have access to the Emergency Response Contingency Plan. This plan consists of an emergency notification call down list containing 24 hour contact numbers for all trained responders, the duties for Ammonia Specialist/Responders, contact information for the LEPC, SERC, NRC, TCEQ, and a  MSDS  for Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\nBGC Ice/Freezer Facility is planning changes to improve safety. In addition to our annual training requirements, BGC Ice/Freezer  will also conduct internal bi-annual training. Annual audits, conducted by an outside source, are currently being budgeted for implementation. Another change to policy is the security guards; they will receive advanced training from an internal source. Cross training of maintenance personnel, responsible for the ammonia, will continue between the facilities. With these changes to improve safety and continuing good engineering practices, BGC Ice/Freezer will continue to be a safe facility."
