      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\n \n  West Liberty Foods (WLF) is a two hundred forty five thousand square foot turkey processing plant owned by the Iowa Turkey Growers Cooperative with the mission to provide the safest food products to our customers at the best possible prices.  Our product list includes many varieties of luncheon meats; custom prepared deli products, as well as many bulk items prepared to order for our customers.  As our product lists have grown, so has our work force.  We have over 900 employees with production on all three shifts handling over two million pounds of turkey meat each week.  Production of this quantity requires refrigeration to keep the products below 40 degrees to insure food safety.  WLF has 90,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on site for use in our cooling and freezing systems. \n\nThe prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia is a top priority of the management at WLF.  Management is committed to both our Process Safety Management (PSM) program and to an extensive worker safety-training program.  However, if an accidental release should occur, WLF has a trained Hazmat team and the appropriate chemical response equipment.  Our Hazmat team has been trained and certified to handle chemical releases that might occur at the WLF facility.  The WLF Hazmat team has drills and meetings to talk about how we will handle releases if they should happen.  WLF evaluates its emergency response plan by conducting tabletop, walk through and full-scale exercises.  In an actual release event WLF would evacuate the plant, assemble members of the WLF Hazmat team, assess the incident and if required call the LEPC, call the local First Responders fire and medical team, and the West Liberty Police.  The incident will be further evaluated and the team will respond in the best practical and safe manner.\n\nThe Worst-Case release scenario used in our RMP was a manifold break in our receiver tanks.  WLF has three tanks coupled together by manifold pipes.  Ea"

      "SummaryText": "ch tank has the capacity to hold a total of 8000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  Full capacity was used to calculate the worst-case scenario so the maximum effect of a leak could be figured.  This worst case has 24,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia released from a ruptured manifold pipe at a rate of 2,400 lbs/minute for 10 minutes.  We used RMP*Comp to calculate a toxic end point of 1.9 miles.  This toxic endpoint would include within its radius residences, schools, commercial & office, industrial and recreation areas.  A release such as this would require the assistance of the Muscatine county LEPC, the local First Responders fire and medical team, and the West Liberty Police.  The entire town of 3,332 people would need to be evacuated.  A release of this magnitude at the facility is not likely to happen as there are barriers in place to protect the tanks and piping from being hit by trucks or other objects.  West Liberty Foods has a 15 MPH speed limit on the property and our receivers have been located in a very safe location.  \n\nFor the alternative scenario we figured the same receivers at the same ammonia levels.  This example used a pressure relief valve failure releasing anhydrous ammonia for 20 minutes at 800 pounds per minute.  Using RMP*Comp the toxic endpoint would be 0.2 mile.  This toxic endpoint would include within its radius residences, commercial & office, industrial and recreation areas.
