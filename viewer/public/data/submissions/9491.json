The Facility Policy\n\n    The owner, and employees of Barr Farms, are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of  \n    anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the  \n    local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to  \n    people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n   - This facility is a privately owned commercial farm.\n   - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production  \n     nutrients. \n   - The maximum quantity stored would be 57,500 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled would be the  \n     storage tank of 57,500 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n   a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  \n       released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 57,500 pounds, which  \n       represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design   \n       standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .71 miles.\n   b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in  \n       a transfer hose,  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of  \n    Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the   \n    standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \n    \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.

The emergency response program.\n\n   - The facility has:\n\n   a. Been included in the community emergency response plan developed under EPCRA.\n\n   b. Appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a  \n       response\n \n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is and on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to  \n    assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia   \n    safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
