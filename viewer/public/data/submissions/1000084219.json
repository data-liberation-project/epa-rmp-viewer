The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Louisville facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  The Maintenance Manager is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, and/or equipment.  These rules are detailed and "

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Kentucky Distribution Center is managed by Zenith Logistics, Inc.  The facility is a warehouse that  stores perishable and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to retail outlets.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities for warehouse areas.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 45,000 pounds.  An ammonia release from the system poses a risk of offsite public and/or environmental injury or impact.  The system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP (40 CFR Part 68) program.\n\nThe facility also has a storage and dispensing system for hydrogen (CAS #1333-74-0), a flammable gas stored under pressure.  Hydrogen is brought in via tanker truck and offloaded to the hydrogen storage system located to the west of the warehouse.  The storage units will hold a maximum of 13,400 lbs. of hydrogen.  The hydrogen is piped inside the warehouse for fuel for lifts used inside the warehouse.  There are 3 dispensing/fueling stations inside the warehouse.  A release of hydrogen from the system could pose a risk of offsite injury from fire/explosion, the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The system is also subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RMP program.  The hydrogen storage facilities are operated and maintained by"

Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAMMONIA\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Kentucky Distribution Center facility for the ammonia refrigeration process involves the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the control pressure receiver (CPR-1).  This quantity represents the maximum quantity of ammonia in the receiver at any time.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n?    The worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical and industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver.  \n\n?    The receiver is located in a low traffic area within the engine room which minimizes the possibility of loss of containment due to vehicular impact (e.g., from forklifts etc.)\n\n?    Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n\n?    An ammonia detector is located near the receiver in the engine room.\n\n?    Pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in the receiver.\n\n?    The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of vessels.\n\n?    The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel\n\n?    The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia at the Kentucky Distribution Center facility involves the release of 1,140 pounds of ammonia over a 60 minute period through a defective pressure safety valve (PSV) on the control pressure receiver (CP"

This quantity represents the quantity of hydrogen in the tank at any time.   This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program using RMP Comp to calculate the endpoint distance at which injury may be caused to people.   The calculated endpoint distance was 1,584 feet (.3 miles).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n?
