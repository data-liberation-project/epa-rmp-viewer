A comprehensive accidental release prevention program is incorporated and adopted in the Chandler Water Treatment Plant Process Sfety Management Plan and the Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP). This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. In the Process Safety Management Plan, the safety consultant has calculated the scrubber control capacity to exceed that requirement to control a release from all of the chlorine containers supplying the system at one time.  The Chlorine scrubber exhaust system can provide one complete air exchange of the Chlorine Storage room every  5 \u00bd  minutes. The Chandler Fire Department provides emergency response expertise to the site. The plant receives two fire inspections from the Fire Department annually one must be completed after the HMMP permit is issued. A complete HMMP is submitted to the Fire Department annually for compliance. The HMMP is reviewed by the Fire Department, a fire inspection is completed and the HMMP permit is issued.\n\n2. Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant\u00bfs primary activities encompass TREATMENT OF PUBLIC WATER UTILITY SYSTEM. Chlorine is the only regulated substance present at the facility. The maximum inventory of Chlorine at the facility is 12 one-ton containers (24,000 lb). Four one-ton containers are manifolded together for the water treatment processing. Additionally, eight one-ton containers are stored in the water treatment process area.  All chlorine"

All chlorine cylinders connected to the delivery system are individually equipped with automatic shutoff devices.  At the first detection of chlorine by the monitoring system the automatic shutoff devices are closed and the scrubber system is activated. \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nRMP*Comp (TM) was used to evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios . \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from one-ton cylinder on the loading dock. If a Chlorine leak did occur, which is highly unlikely, it would be during loading and unloading of the cylinders at the dock area.  If a leak occurs procedures are in place to immediately move the leaking Chlorine cylinder into the scrubber room.  The planning distance for this scenario is entirely contained on-site, and with no residential units within the planning distance. The original report contained a typographical error.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, and NFPA Standards. The process at the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at the facility, which are fully described in the PSMP.\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant maintains a detailed record of saf"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n4.7 Pre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes am conducted as a regular practice at the Chandler Water Treatment Plant. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n4.8 Compliance Audits\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant conducts audits in accordance with the PSMP to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n4.9 Incident Investigation\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant promptly investigates any incident in accordance with the PSMP that has resulted in, or could result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.\nAll reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n4.10 Employee Participation\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to stringent release prevention policies, there has been no reportable accidental release during this period.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe Chandler Water Treatment Plant HMMP carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental release of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nThe plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.
