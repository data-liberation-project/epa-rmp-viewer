(\"PG&E\")\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  PG&E's  policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel and emergency personnel when appropriate, will respond to control and contain the release to ensure the safety of our employees and the public.\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant, located 17 miles west of Freer on Highway 44 in Webb County Texas, operates processes to extract liquid petroleum products from the natural gas stream. This liquid product consists of ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline, which are regulated flammable substances. In order to establish as safe an environment as possible for our employees and the public, PG&E has elected to maintain minimum inventories (below the threshold quantity) of toxic substances. \n  \n The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the surge tank containing 100,000 lbs. of ethane.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this WCS is 0.40 mile or 2022 feet. Although PG&E has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive and/or active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WC"

      "SummaryText": "S.\n \n The surge tank was built and installed to ASME Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII Standards.  It is equipped with a Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) or Relief Valve. The PSV and all other safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15-month intervals. These tests are conducted as a part of the mechanical integrity element of PG&E's PSM program, which the plant has had in place for the past several years.  Ultrasonic testing is also performed on non-insulated piping and vessels in the plant to determine that the wall thickness of the piping and vessels meets service requirements.\n \n An Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of 1300 lbs. of methane from a leak within the compressor building. Such a release is expected to be isolated by automatic shutdown valves within 5 minutes (active mitigation).  These valves would receive a signal to close from a gas detection system with monitors located in the compressor building. The maximum distance to the 1-psi over pressure endpoint for this event is 0.04 mile or 211 feet.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n \n The gas detection system, the automatic shutdown valves and other safety devices are function tested once per calendar year not to exceed 15-month intervals. These tests are a part of the mechanical integrity element of our PSM program, which has been in place for several years.\n  \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation they are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program and how the 14 elements of the PSM standard are being addressed is included in the PSM Policy and Implementation Plan which is maintained at the plant.  In addition, the gas plant has initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issue.  These initiatives include individual safety awards presented for safety excellence during the previous year.\n \n Process Safety Information\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant management is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is always readily available to the employees.\n \n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, pressure) in a Cause & Effect Diagram. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls,"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and training, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \n Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n The plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures may be necessary. \n \n The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n \n Operating Procedures\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) start-up following a turnaround or emergency shut down.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n \n In addition, the gas plant maintains a Cause and Effect Diagram that provides information on how each of the process equipment will react to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished prior to their beginning work by providing contractors with: (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices.  In addition, the plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \n Specialized Safety Features\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help: (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n \n Release Detection\n \n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms.\n2. Low pressure alarms and shutdowns.\n\n Release Containment Control\n \n1.   Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n2.    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high pressure).\n \n3.    Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\n \n4.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump).\n \n5.    Atmospheric relief devices to protect pressure vessels.\n \n Release Mitigation\n \n1.     Fire suppression and extinguishing systems. \n \n2.     Trained  personnel\n\n\n \n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been a decreasing trend in the frequency of accidental releases. None of the accidental releases that have occurred in the past 5 years resulted in offsite effects.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. \n  \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a "

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n \n Safe Work Practices\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and safety procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and safety procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures and others, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n \n Management of Change (MOC)\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to: (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  All operators and/or effected employees must review, understand and sign the MOC (Form 703) prior to starting his/her shift. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \n Incident Investigation\n \n The Shilling Gas Plant promptly investigates"

      "SummaryText": " all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  This information is communicated to other company employees in other plants by way of the PSM News Brief.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations. \n \n Compliance Audits\n \n To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Shilling Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n \n CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n \n The processes at the Shilling Gas Plant must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
