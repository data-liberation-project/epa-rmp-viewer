The BWWP has emphasized its commitment to safety by holding monthly shift meetings emphasizing safety, and have been rewarded in this approach by having no accidental releases of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance\nThe Whitlock WTP is located at 1920 West 11th Street, on the west side of Pueblo near the Arkansas River.  Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia are used at the WTP to provide disinfection of the public water supply.  The primary plant chlorination process store chlorine in one-ton cylinders, and no more that 30 cylinders of chlorine (60,000 pounds) are stored at the WTP. The primary anhydrous ammonia system includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in four 2,000 gallon storage tanks for a maximum storage capacity of 8,000 gallons (35,200 pounds).  The settling facility ammonia system includes storage of anhydrous ammonia in two 3,000 gallon storage tanks for a maximum capacity of 6,000 gallons (26,400 pounds).\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\nThe worst case release scenario for the primary chlorination process involves the loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine from a single cylinder of chlorine outside of any enclosure. The rule for worst case release analysis assumes all of the contents are released in 10 minutes. The alternative case release scenario for the primary chlorination process was based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities, and involves the release of 1,550 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes as a result of a crack in the cylinder caused by a drop during transport.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed using RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance t"

The worst case release scenario for the settling facility anhydrous ammonia process involves the loss of 7,252 pounds of ammonia from a single anhydrous ammonia storage tank in 10 minutes.  The alternative case release scenarios for both primary and settling facility anhydrous ammonia process was based on accident history at the site, process hazard analysis, and experience at similar facilities and involves the release of 4,340 pounds of chlorine in 30 minutes as a result of a pump seal failure on the tanker truck during filling operations.  The distance to endpoint for both scenarios were analyzed during RMP*Comp, and the analyses resulted in a worst case release scenario distance to endpoint of 1.2 miles for the primary anhydrous ammonia process and 1.0 miles for the settling facility anhydrous ammonia process, and an alternative case release scenario distance of endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe accidental release prevention program complies with the requirements for Program Level 2 processes.  The prevention program includes an employee training program based on the written operating procedures for the WTP, as well as maintenance, inspection, and testing program for equipment utilized within the covered processes.  These programs all serve to prevent or minimize unintended releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe WTP has not had an accidental release of chlorine or anhydrous ammonia within the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WTP is included within a written community emergency response plan, and the primary responder to the WTP is the City of Pueblo Fire Department.  WTP employees handle incidental relea"
