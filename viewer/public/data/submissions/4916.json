The                  \n    facility manufactures fiberglass building insulation which is sold in the commercial,               \n    residential, and retail markets.  The facility currently encompasses approximately 17               \n    acres under roof and is set in 160 acres of rural area.  There are presently about 330 full         \n    time employees who operate the Plant 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.                               \n                                                                                                        \n    Johns Manville places a strong emphasis on safety and environmental leadership.  The                \n    Company fosters a proactive philosophy to ensure that employees work in a safe                      \n    environment and that each facility remains in full compliance with all applicable federal,          \n    state, county and local regulations.  JM is also committed to environmental leadership              \n    within the community served.  This commitment is exemplified in the McPherson                       \n    Facilitys strong recycling and waste minimization programs.  The Companys long term               \n    goal is to have zero process wastes taken to disposal facilities, with all residual materials       \n    either recycled or used for beneficial purposes.  The Facility demonstrates another                 \n    example of its aggressive position on recycling through its use of extraordinarily high             \n    levels of outside, post-consumer glass in its forming process.  This crushed glass, or              \n    cullet would otherwise be "

The storage             \n    vessels are constructed and operated in accordance with ASME specifications.  The resin             \n    storage process is designed to minimize spills in the event of an accidental release.  The          \n    resin storage room and adjacent rooms are equipped with trenches that minimize the                  \n    surface area of a spill.  In addition, the resin storage room is maintained at 50 degrees F         \n    to reduce the volatility of the material.  Although not a qualifying mitigation measure for         \n    the 112R program, low storage temperatures give plant personnel adequate time to react              \n    to the situation by reducing the volatilization rate of the resin material.  As a result of         \n    these factors, Johns Manville has not experienced an accidental release of formaldehyde             \n    over the entire life of the facility.  Modeling impacts indicate that a worst-case release of       \n    formaldehyde from the resin storage tanks would not impact the public beyond the                    \n    Facilitys property line and therefore is qualified as a Program 1 facility.                        \n                                                                                                        \n    With the exception of minor incidents, it is the Facilitys policy to immediately contact           \n    and rely on outside emergency responders in the event of a significant unforeseen or                \n    accidental release of formaldehyde-containing liquid resin.

Under a worst-case scenario, a single vessel containing                \n    6,000 gallons of liquid resin, which includes about 10% formaldehyde, is assumed to spill           \n    with partial containment (low-lying pavement and trenches) in the resin room and                    \n    adjacent water reclaim room.  Liquid not contained in these rooms is assumed to spill               \n    outside and is contained by low-lying paved areas.  Distance to the toxic endpoint of 12.0          \n    mg/m3 is calculated for McPherson using AFTOX, a dispersion model that will determine               \n    toxic chemical concentrations at hazard distances.  According to AFTOX, a worst-case                \n    resin spill and subsequent formaldehyde vaporization onsite at McPherson will result in a           \n    distance of 0.09 miles to the toxic endpoint.  A plant and topographic map analysis                 \n    indicates that 0.09 miles from the location of the resin tank is completely onsite.                 \n    Therefore, the formaldehyde-containing liquid resin process at McPherson does not                   \n    qualify for Program 2 of 112R.                                                                      \n                                             "
