The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Central Farmers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. Facility Information\n\n     -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.             \n     \n     -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. \n\n     -The maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon stroage tanks.  The \n maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or  tank car) released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4  miles.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .70 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handlin"

There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n          - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n    \n          - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n            property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\n     -The facility has:\n\n     a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     c.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information \n          as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     d.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120,\n          including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety."
