The finished product resins are in the form of non-hazardous clear liquids.\n\nFIVE (5) YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe EPA regulations require regulated facilities to provide information about all accidents in the last 5 years involving an RMP regulated substance if the accident resulted in  (1) death, injury according to the RMP definition, or significant property damage on site, or, (2) known deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage off site.\n\nGreensboro Operations have not had any accidents meeting the regulatory definition in the last five years.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS:\n\nAs part of the EPA regulations, Process Safety Management requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) Responsible CareR Commitment, the Greensboro facility is required to conduct Hazard Assessments of regulated processes.   EPA regulations specifically require offsite consequence analyses in the form of Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios for certain regulated substances. \n\nGenCorp is concerned that these Worst Case Scenarios required to be disclosed under the regulations may overstate the risk of a worst case release.  For example, the EPA published lookup tables do not take any local physical conditions into account.  An alternative to the lookup tables (allowed by the regulation) is to calculate release scenarios upon recognized risk analysis techniques, or \"models.\"  Limited consideration of local conditions is used in the models within strict EPA guidelines. Accordingly, GenCorp uses the EPA recognized models in preparing its release scenarios.   While these models may be more accurate, they can still result in highly improbable and in some cases physically impossible risk scenarios.  For example, neither lookup tables nor models allow consideration of existing active safety devices such as sprinkler systems, which can reduce the severity of an accidental release.   T"

      "SummaryText": "he models also increase the number of specific data points examined and, thus, present the most accurate information possible using all required inputs. \n\n GenCorp has also prepared Alternative Release Scenarios which it believes are more accurate predictions of potential accidental releases from the Greensboro facility.  Alternative Release Scenarios are by definition more likely to occur than Worst Case Scenarios but are still very improbable due to engineering and administrative controls at the Greensboro Plant.\n WORST CASE SCENARIO:\n\nEPA regulations require facilities to develop one Worst Case Scenario to represent all toxic substances and one Worst Case Scenario to represent all flammable substances from a list of regulated materials.  Additional Worst Case Scenarios are required if different public receptors (off site residences, businesses or community buildings within a possible impact radius) could be affected by the release of another regulated material.  GenCorp is not subject to this additional requirement.\n\nWhen examining the following Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios, it is important to keep in mind that GenCorp has numerous preventative measures in place at its Greensboro facility to effectively prevent these situations. These measures, most of which were not taken into consideration under the EPA regulations include leak detection systems, continuous monitoring and automated controls, automatic shutdowns, deluge water systems, secondary containment dikes, and employees specially trained in handling and emergency response methods.\n\nFlammable Materials\n\nThe Greensboro Plant does not use any of the 63 listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.  \n\nToxic Materials\n\nThe Greensboro Plant only uses one of the 77 regulated toxic substances on site above the regulatory threshold, 37= % Formaldehyde Solution.\n\nGenCorp's Worst-Case Scenario for a regulated toxic substance is the release of the entire contents of the Formaldehyde stora"

It also assumes, unrealistically, that facility employees would do nothing to mitigate the release.  GenCorp does not think that this worst case is likely and, in fact, it may not even be possible due to the conservative assumptions required by the regulation.  An array of mitigation techniques are in place to reduce the severity of any potential release, including trained operation personnel, control systems, Emergency response Program, and system hazard review.\n\n ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO MODEL:\n\nApplicable EPA regulations also require facilities to submit one alternative release scenario to represent all flammables and one to represent each toxic material. \n\nFlammable Alternative:\n\nGenCorp's Greensboro Plant uses none of the 63 listed flammable substances above the regulated threshold.\n\nToxic Alternatives\n\nThe Greensboro Plant's alternative release scenario model also involves formaldehyde (37= % solution). It assumes a pipeline gasket fails during transfer of material spraying solution during a period of one hour.  While this is a more realistic presentation of what could happen at the Greensboro Plant, this type of incident still remains highly unlikely given the fact that trained personnel are ready to respond.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nGenCorp has initiated a formal Process Safety Management (PSM) program at the Greensboro facility. PSM in concert with effective engineering design, Employee Safety Programs, Chemical Manufacturers Association Responsible Careb, and Emergency Response Programs make up the Greensboro Plant's Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nGenCorp's overall safety efforts at Greensboro consist of measures to prevent the release of hazardous material, as well as programs to mitigate the effects if a release should occur.

Coordination with local emergency response agencies is a key element of the emergency response planning process.  Specific plans are in place to respond to chemical emergencies within the facility.\n\n\n PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nIntrinsic safety is a key element in the design of all process equipment at the facility.  All covered process equipment design and modification is subject to formal hazard analysis procedures.  During hazard analysis, key recommendations are made for improvement to the process.  Application of new design principles to existing equipment is a key element of continuous process safety improvement.\n\nContinued training and planned drills will improve emergency response capabilities.\n\nReplacement of the plant's 37= % Formaldehyde storage vessel from 20,000 gallons down to a 12,000-gallon storage vessel will be completed before June 21, 1999. \n\nProcess equipment upgrades to the resin manufacturing system are also planned as part of the plant's commitment to continuous improvement."
