As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, DENCO, LLC. completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds for a flammable mixture (pentane and butane) and 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDENCO, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically aqueous ammonia, anhydrous ammonia, and pentane and butane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The aqueous ammonia is used as a nutrient source for yeast and anhydrous ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of DENCO, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of DENCO, LLC. to notify the Morris Fire Department, and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for nutrients and pH control.  The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be approximately 62,000 pounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used for pH control.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia present at the site is 15,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 40 percent pentane an"

      "SummaryText": "d 10% butane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 75,000 pounds.  The unleaded gasoline/natural gasoline is stored in 1 above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Due to the varying nature of the denaturant both pentane and butane are listed as regulated constituents.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  DENCO, LLC. has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  An Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. DENCO, LLC. has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough the completion of this RMP, DENCO, LLC. has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nDENCO, LLC. does not have a history of accidents which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n"
