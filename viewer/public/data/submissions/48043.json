THROUGHOUT WILBUR-ELLIS COMPANY A COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY PROGRAM IS IN EFFECT WHICH INCLUDES TRAINING, INSPECTIONS, SAFETY MEETINGS AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY.  THIS FACILITY HANDLES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND AQUA AMMONIA FOR FERTILIZER USE.  THE CHEMICALS ARE STORED IN ABOVE GROUND TANKS.  AQUA AMMONIA IS MADE FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF WATER AND AMMONIA.  NO OTHER CHEMICAL REACTIONS OR PROCESSES ARE LOCATED AT THIS FACILITY. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO INVOLVES THE LOSS OF THE LARGEST TANK INSTANTANEOUSLY.  THE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE WILL IMPACT THE IMMEDIATE ARE AROUND THE PLANT.  THIS WAS DETERMINED USING THE ALOHA MODEL.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO INVOLVES THE INSTANTANEOUS LOSS OF FIVE POUNDS OF AMMONIA OR FIFTY GALLONS OF AQUA AMMONIA FROM DISCONNECTING A HOSE OR OVERFILLING A TANK RESPECTIVELY.  HIS FACILITY IS COVERED BY OSHA REGULATIONS AND IS VISITED PERIODICALLY BY OTHER AGENCIES.  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS INVOLVING THESE CHEMICALS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS REVIEWED AND TRAINED ANNUALLY.  TRAINING AT WILBUR-ELLIS COMPANY IS AN ONGOING PROGRAM EACH YEAR AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS ARE SHARED WITH LOCAL AND COUNTY AGENCIES."
