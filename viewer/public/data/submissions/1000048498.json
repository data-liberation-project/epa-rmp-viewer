The Facility Policy:\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Boise City Farmers Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information:\n\n\n\n?    The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for the direct application of fertilizers for crop \n\n        production nutrients.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario:\n\n\n\na.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas \n\n        over 10 minutes.  \n\nb.    The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a\n\n        release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release prevention program:\n\n\n\n        The facility has referred to the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, \n\n        Kk-611.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational \n\n        Safety   and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n\n\n5.    The Five-year Accident History:\n\n\n\na.    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n\n\n?    Have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n?    To our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries,"

The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\n        The facility has:\n\n\n\nb.    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required \n\n        under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\n        Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the \n\n        maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations \n\n        for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
