Several of the grades involve a process in\n\nwhich chlorine is added to the milled flour to achieve a desired\n\npH.  In addition, a small amount of chlorine is added to the\n\nwheat prior to storage and milling to inhibit microbial growth.\n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to Mennel Milling Co. and used in one ton\n\ncontainers and 150-pound containers.  The supplier delivers full\n\nchlorine containers to the site via truck.  The containers are\n\nunloaded and stored in the indoor storage area by the use of an\n\noverhead crane rail hoist.  Mennel Milling staff connects the ton\n\ncontainers and 150-pound cylinders to the feed system.  The\n\nmaximum number of ton containers is 6 (12,000 pounds) and 150-\n\npound cylinders is 3 (450 pounds).\n\n\n\nMennel Milling Co. uses vacuum feed systems that are inherently\n\nsafe.  These systems involve the use of air or water flowing\n\nthrough an eductor that creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for\n\nthe feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.\n\nIf a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken\n\nor develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum\n\nregulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of\n\nchlorine gas.\n\n\n\nMennel Milling Co. has contracted with Research Products Co.\n\n(REPCO) of Salina, Kansas to perform preventive and corrective\n\nmaintenance on the chlorine feed systems.\n\n\n\nMennel Milling Co. has developed a comprehensive, accidental\n\nrelease prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The\n\nelements of this program include:\n\n     u    Process Safety Information\n\nu    Process Hazard Analysis\n\nu    Operating Procedures\n\nu    Training\n\nu    Management of Change\n\nu    Pre-Startup Safety Review\n\nu    Compliance Audits\n\nu    Incident Investigation\n\nu    Contractor Management\n\n     u    Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\nI"

      "SummaryText": "n the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of\n\nchlorine at Mennel Milling Co. that have resulted in deaths,\n\ninjuries, or significant damage on site, or known offsite deaths,\n\ninjuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or\n\nenvironmental damage.\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan has been developed for the site.  This\n\nplan contains measures that Mennel Milling Co. staff can take to\n\nalert employees to a release, how to distinguish between an\n\nincidental release and a significant release, and many other\n\nelements.  Mennel Milling Co. staff will receive training to\n\nallow for defensive action in response to an on-site release.  In\n\nthe event of a chlorine release, Mennel Milling will contact the\n\nDowagiac Fire Department for technical support.  The fire\n\ndepartment is trained and equipped to respond to chlorine\n\nincidents.  The facility has coordinated its emergency response\n\nactivities with the City of Dowagiac Fire Department and the Cass\n\nCounty Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nMennel Milling Co. has reviewed hazard evaluations previously\n\nprepared for the chlorination processes at the facility.  As a\n\nresult of this evaluation, several changes are planned to improve\n\nsafety.  These changes include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n     u    When meetings of the Chlorine Safety Team are convened,\n\n       minutes should be taken and retained on file.\n\nu    Develop a system to ensure that the findings and\n\nrecommendations of the revalidated PHA are addressed.\n\nu    Provide for an annual review of the written operating\n\nprocedures and certify that they are current and accurate.\n\nu    Provide annual operations and maintenance training\n\nincluding:\n\n          o    Confirm that all affected employees have received the\n\n            necessary training and that the tests used to determine their\n\n            competency are on file.\n\no    Implement the training program included in Section 5.0 of\n\nthe PSM Program.
