This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled:  Our facility's primary activities encompass chemical manufacturing. We have two regulated substances present at the facility. These substances are Sulfur Trioxide and Acrylonitrile. Sulfur Trioxide is used in our Reservol Production, while Acrylonitrile is used in the production of Amine Adducts, TGUM-AHG, and ANOBEX. The maximum inventory of Sulfur Trioxide, considering administrative controls, is 80,000 lb. The maximum inventory of Acrylonitrile is 40,000 lb.\n\n\n\nThe General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  Our facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR 68. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:  Tiarco Chemical maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the processes using sulfur trioxide and acrylonitrile.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Major Hazard Analysis. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety, e"

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of our facility's PSM and RMP program, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors:  A procedure is in place to cover the use of outside contractors. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance would be carried out. Tiarco Chemical has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency action should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur. The safety performance of contractors is evaluated on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:  Tiarco Chemical had a release of Sulfur Trioxide on February 9, 2008. Approximately 0.5 lb of vapor was released over a 30 minute period. The Donaldson Center Fire Department responded to the release. No employees or responders were injured as a result of the release. No one in the community was injured and there was no property damage. As a result of the accident, Tiarco Chemical repaired and improved the failed equipment and revised the maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  Tiarco Chemical has a written emergency plan addressing, among other things, evacuation, notification of emergency responders, state agencies, and the public, mitigation actions that can be taken, first air and medical treatment, and preventive actions to avoid exposure to sulfur trioxide or acrylonitrile.
