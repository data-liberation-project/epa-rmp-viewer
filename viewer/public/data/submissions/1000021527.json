A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe BC Systems plant covered by this RMP is located at 16411 9th Street, Huron, California. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  Three portable ammonia refrigeration systems are used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 8,340 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n1.3.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at BC Systems is accomplished through the following:\nA?    sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction\nA?    specification and review of system modifications\nA?    day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system  \nDay-to day operation and maintenance includes:\nA?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\nA?    Performance of a thorough hazard review at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\nA?    Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed as part of the hazard review process\nA?    Appropriate initia"

Five-Year Accident History\nThe Huron, California has had no ammonia releases that resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, property damage, off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n1.5.    Emergency Response Program\nBC Systems has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the site's Safety Office and reviewed annually.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \nThe site has an Ammonia Emergency Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n1.6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nBased on the Revalidation Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) conducted on October 26, 2010 the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:\n \n\n\n#    Actions    PHA Table\nItem #    Assignee    Due Date /\nStatus\n1    Install a diffusion tank to capture ammonia vapors that may be released from the associated PRVs.    1    Carlos    April 2011 - Santa Maria Diffusion tank to be installed\n2    Site will develop service procedures that will incorporate isolation procedures.    7    Carlos    April 2011 - To be completed\n\n\n\n\n"
