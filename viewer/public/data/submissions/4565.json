      "SummaryText": "ORTEC, INC.\nGeneral Executive Summary\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nOrtec, Inc. is strongly dedicated to employee, public and environmental safety.  This committment to safety starts with our senior management staff and filters down throughout our entire organization. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with regulated processes at our facility.  \n\nII. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\nOrtec, Inc. is a custom chemical manufacturer.  Our primary business includes various adhesives, coating polymers, and similar polymers.  We presently have one regulated toxic substance present at our facility.  This substance is Acrylonitrile [2-Propenenitrile].  Acrylonitrile is a raw material used in making our polymers.\n\nAcrylonitrile is stored in an 8,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum inventory for Acrylonitrile at our facility is 46,900 pounds.  \n\nIII. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.06.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a catastrophic release of Acrylonitrile.  The scenario release amount is 46,900 lbs of Acrylonitrile.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 536 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint o"

      "SummaryText": "f 0.076 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Acrylonitrile involves a release from ST#34, the Acrylonitrile storage tank. The scenario involves the release of 36,000 lbs of Acrylonitrile.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 360 minutes.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L.  Dikes are used as passive mitigation control and are taken into account to calculate both scenarios. \n\nControl measures in place but not considered in the scenarios include:  the manual application of foam to suppress Acrylonitrile vapors and the manual application of sodium metabisulfite to neutralize spills.  The tank is also enclosed in a 16' x 16' sealed concrete walls.  This concrete enclosure limits the exposed surface area of a pool and thus the release rate is most probably less than the release rate reported in the scenarios.  Plastic sheeting is made available to cover spills, thereby limiting vapor releases.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm prevent more than 7,000 gallons from being present in the 8,000 gallon tank.  The tank is inspected for signs of leaks or damage weekly by maintenance personnel and every 4 hours by operations supervision.  \n\n\nIV. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA regulations.  Our facility also meets the requirements of the OSHA PSM rule.  For our covered process, a pre-startup review was conducted along with specific training by the supplier on the handling of Acrylonitrile.  All of our affected employees are trained yearly on the hazards associated with Acrylonitrile and safe handling practices.  Only d"

We maintain current MSDSs for all our raw materials and products.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and properly controlled.  Depending on the process, we use both the Hazard and Operability Study and Checklist methodologies to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance, safety, and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nOrtec, Inc. maintains written operating procedures in order to safely conduct activities within our covered process.  The procedure for Acrylonitrile tanker unloading addresses personal protective equipment required, abnormal conditions, and emergency equipment/supplies requirements.  This procedure is regularly reviewed and used by the operators each time an Acrylonitrile tanker is unloaded.  \n\nTraining\nOrtec, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who handle Acrylonitrile are competent in safe handling practices to protect themselves and their surroundings.  Refresher training is provided on Acrylonitrile handling at least yearly and more frequently as needed.  Air monitoring is also conducted periodically during unloading operations to ensure that workers are not being overexposed.  The results are posted for all employees to review.  \n\nComprehensive training is also con"

Safety procedures and alarms are reviewed during this training.\n\nAdditionally, employees are trained on RCRA regulations so they are environmentally aware.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nOrtec, Inc. carries out documented maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others;  storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Ortec, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.  \n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Ortec, Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\nIncident Investigation\nOrtec, Inc. truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  By participation in the Ortec Safety Committee, employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.
