As part of this commitment, we have established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit an executive summary in the risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Wisconsin Tissue.  This document is intended to satisfy the executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\nOur risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n1.   A hazard assessment designed to help us understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topics 3 and 5\n\n2.   A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate processes containing significant quantities of substances regulated by the RMP rule - see topic 4\n\n3.   An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from processes covered by the RMP rule - see topic 6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this executive summary.\n\nAlthough our risk management program helps ensure that our facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program.  In fact, we have a comprehensive safety program that establishes many levels of safeguards against accidental rele"

Before using a hazardous substance, we always consider less hazardous alternatives.  When we must use a hazardous substance, we consider the potential for this substance to adversely affect our workers, the public, and the environment and take steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nPreventing releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment used to contain it is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nLimiting damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  We work daily to prevent accidental releases from occurring.  However, we also train our workforce to recognize accidental releases, quickly assess the severity of a release, and contact the local fire department if emergency response actions are necessary. We work closely with the local fire department to ensure appropriate plans are in place to minimize the impact of the release on our workers and the community.\n\nOur safety program consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWe are committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  We take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These steps include (1) training programs for personnel, (2) programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and (3) programs to evaluate the hazards of the proces"

      "SummaryText": "s.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, we will strive to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public or damage to the environment.  We provide response training to our personnel, and our Shift Supervisor will initially assume the role of Incident Commander.  However, we rely on the City of Menasha Fire Department for executing emergency response actions, including Incident Command.\n\n2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCES WE USE\n\nOur facility is a recycle pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of finished paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, we handle regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes.\n\n                   Process                                                 Regulated Substance(s)\nFiber Prep and Waste Treatment                                  Chlorine\n\n3.  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWe performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental releases of regulated substances that could affect the public or the environment. We evaluated both a worst-case release scenario and a more reasonable (but still highly unlikely) alternative release scenario for chlorine.\n\nWe do not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  This scenario is designed to estimate the maximum possible area that could be affected by a release at our facility, but it is not a realistic scenario.  An alternative release scenario was selected to help the fire department improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that might occur at a facility like Wisconsin Tissue.\n\nThe main objective for performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).

Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could experience more serious effects.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be more severe; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less severe.\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis. \n\n3.1  Worst-case Release Scenario \n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a failure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar.  When we assume that (1) the railcar is full and (2) all the chlorine is released from the railcar over a 10-minute time period, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint (3 ppm) reaches offsite receptors.\n\n3.2  Alternative Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is an unloading hose rupture on a 90-ton chlorine railcar.  In this scenario, we calculate that it takes 15 minutes for Wisconsin Tissue employees to stop the leak by closing remotely operated isolation valves.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint reaches offsite receptors.\n\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe have always believed that safety is the highest priority.  Beginning in 1992, we formalized this belief into a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) rule.  For Wisconsin Tissue, the prevention program requirements of EPA's RMP rule are nearly identical to the PSM rule.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. \n\n4.1  Prevention Program for Chlorine\n\nOur accident prevention program for chlorine consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.

These documents address (1) physical properties of the hazardous substances we handle, (2) operating parameters for our equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n2. Process hazard analysis.  We perform and periodically update process hazard analyses of our covered processes to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our processes.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience. The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process areas. The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to area personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  Each analysis is revisited at least every five years to ensure it is current.\n\n3. Operating procedures.  Our process engineers, operators, and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\n\n    7 Steps for safely conducting activities\n    7 Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\n    7 Safety and health considerations,"

We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin or resume work in the process.\n\n5. Mechanical integrity.  We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance function to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our processes.\n\n6. Management of change.  We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. All changes other than replacement-in-kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n7.

Compliance audit.  One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.  We audit our covered processes every three years to be certain our prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of our operations.  We assemble an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP rules and in our process designs, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of these two rules and whether it is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9. Incident investigation.  We investigate all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented in the future.  We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n10. Employee participation.

We have a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in our facility.  We reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form.  The appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the hot work permit form is included in our safe work practices orientation.\n\n12. Contractors.  We have a program in place to help ensure that contractor activities at our facility are performed in a safe manner.  We explain to the contract supervisors the hazards of the processes on which they and their employees will work, our safe work practices, and our emergency response procedures.  The contractor is required to ensure that training has been performed for each of their employees who will work at the facility before that worker begins work at our facility. \n\n4.2  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the chlorine used at our facility.  The following paragraph describes some of these safety features.\n\nChlorine is supplied in 90-ton railcars that are approved by both the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine is fed through braided metal flexible hoses into process piping.  We have installed permanently mounted chlorine sensors at locations near likely release points to alert operators of even small chlorine leaks.  There are also sensors that monitor the position of the railcar.  If the car begins to move away from the unloading position, the valves on the railcar are automatically closed.\n\n5.

There is one recorded accidental release that resulted in exposing an employee to chlorine in sufficient quantity to require medical attention.\n\nThere have been other releases of chlorine in the past that have caused odor concerns in the facility and the surrounding community.  Although none of these releases were severe enough to meet the requirements for reporting in the RMP five-year accident history, they were investigated as accidents.  As a result of the investigations, additional safeguards have been put into place to help reduce the likelihood of a catastrophic release.\n\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\nWe have established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n    7 Informing the Menasha Fire Department about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n    7 Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to hazardous substances\n    7 Obtaining outside assistance to control and contain accidental releases of hazardous substances, including the use of emergency response equipment\n    7 Inspecting and maintaining emergency response equipment\n    7 Reviewing and updating the emergency response plan\n\n We have trained our employees to recognize and report emergency situations, and the Shift Supervisor is in charge of coordinating emergency actions until the fire department arrives.
