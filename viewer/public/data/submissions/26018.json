Wastewater contains microorganisms that are harmful to human health.  Several treatment processes are utilized at the plant to treat the raw wastewater, and a chlorination system provides disinfection of the water prior to discharge.  Sulfur dioxide is used to reduce the chlorine concentration in the treated wastewater to acceptable levels prior to discharge. \n\nSTORAGE\n\nNormal operating conditions consist of an inventory of eight one-ton containers of chlorine and four one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  All eight one-ton chlorine and four one-ton containers are stored in the chlorine or sulfur dioxide storage rooms.  During periods of inclement weather, the maximum inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide could be twelve one-ton containers of chlorine and eight one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  During this time, the four additional one-ton containers of each chemical are stored in a covered area outside the chemical storage rooms.  The one-ton containers of chlorine are painted gray on the outside while the sulfur dioxide containers are painted orange.  This color-coding system helps in identification of the individual chemicals.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Mountaintop Area Joint Sanitary Authority (MAJSA) treats approximately 4.16 million gallons per day (MGD) of raw domestic wastewater at its treatment plant.  The chlorine used for disinfection is supplied from one-ton containers.  Additional chlorine is added to the wastewater to reduce ammonia concentrations to acceptable levels prior to discharge.  This additional chlorine raises the concentration of chlorine in the treated water to levels that must be reduced prior to discharge.  Sulfur dioxide is injected into the wastewater to reduce the chlorine concen"

In extreme cases, difficulty in breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from respiratory collapse or lung failure.  The characteristic penetrating odor of chlorine gas usually gives warning of its presence in the air.  At high concentrations, it is visible as a greenish-yellow gas.  Liquid chlorine in contact with the skin or eyes will cause chemical burns and/or frostbite.\n\nIn moist environments, sulfur dioxide converts to sulfurous acid, which may cause skin irritation.  Inhalation of sulfur dioxide may result in dryness and irritation of the nose and throat, choking, coughing, and bronchospasm.  Severe overexposure may be fatal.  In contact with the eyes, sulfur dioxide can penetrate the intact cornea and cause iritis. \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are thoroughly inspected for mechanical integrity and leaking valves prior to leaving the supplier's premises.  The containers are off-loaded from the delivery truck at the treatment plant by an overhead crane with a lifting beam that is specially designed for ton-containers.  The off-loaded containers are inspected by MAJSA personnel prior to departure of the chemical hauling company.  A MAJSA employee is present during the off-loading process.  The one-ton chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are off-loaded directly to the chemical storage areas located inside.  Empty chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers are returned to this area for storage prior to removal from the facility.\n\nThe chlorine storage room contains two chlorine cylinder scales each holding four one-ton containers.  Chlorine liquid leaves the ton-container and, via a one-inch manifold, enters via a section of seamless flexible copper.  From the manifold, chlorine liquid is piped under pressure to the evapor"

The two chlorine evaporator systems provided by USFilter have a design capacity of 10,000 pounds per day.  The chlorine gas leaving the evaporator is then piped under a vacuum to the chlorinator.  \n\nThe chlorinator precisely controls the flow of chlorine to the injector.  A vacuum regulator in the chlorinator shuts off the flow of chlorine gas if the vacuum is lost or interrupted.  Three chlorinators are designated as the base chlorinators and have a design capacity to utilize 10,000 pounds of chlorine per day.  The second set of three chlorinators have a design capacity of 3,000 pounds of chlorine per day and are used only as back-up if the primary units require maintenance.  Water flowing through the injector creates a vacuum from the chlorinator to the injector and this draws the chlorine gas from the chlorinator into the water stream.  Chlorine solution is added to the water stream through a system of nozzles located in all three of the chlorine contact tanks present at the facility.\n\nThe addition of sulfur dioxide liquid occurs by mainly the same process as that described for chlorine.  One difference between the two systems is that the sulfur dioxide evaporators are designed to process 7,500 pounds per day of sulfur dioxide and they normally operate at a lower pressure then chlorine.  Additionally, the two sets of sulfonators operate at 9,500 and 3,000 pounds per day of sulfur dioxide.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nAccidental releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are prevented by routine training and adhering to the written operating procedures that cover the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems from the ton-container unloading through the mixing of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases with the treated wastewater.  These procedures cover both normal operations and emergency operations during which personnel may have to respond to an accidental rele"

Employees who are responsible for disconnecting empty containers and connecting filled containers to the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems have been trained on the operating procedures; inspection of valves, fittings, and the connected piping; and leak testing with an aqueous ammonia solution.  The most recent training in chlorine safety was conducted on May 10, 2002, by an outside contractor.  A list of individuals who participated in this training is provided in Appendix C.\n\nAqueous ammonia reacts with chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas to form a very visible white cloud.  A USFilter representative inspects the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems and performs preventive maintenance on these systems at least once per month.  This additional inspection ensures that worn or damaged parts are replaced and routine maintenance is performed on the evaporators, chlorinators, sulphanators, and the chlorine and sulfur dioxide monitors.  These preventive measures have resulted in the absence of any accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that resulted in personal injury or property damage in the past five years.\n\nThe treatment plant maintains two sets of 30-minute Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and The Chlorine Institute's Emergency Kit \"B\" for ton-containers.  This equipment is stored in a building that is next to the storage rooms that house the chlorine and sulfur dioxide ton-containers.  MAJSA personnel receive annual training on the use of the breathing apparatus and the emergency kit.  The kit contains the necessary tools and other equipment to contain valve leaks and to repair small holes in ton-containers and capping devices for the fusible plugs in the ton-containers.

The fusible metal is designed to melt between 158?F and 165?F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide gases are heavier than air and will settle to the lowest elevation when released.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage rooms and feed rooms are each equipped with an exhaust fan that is mounted near the floor on an outside wall so that any leaks will be exhausted outside the building.  There are elevated air intake vents located in both the storage and feed rooms.  The storage room and feed room exhaust fans can be activated by switches located outside the building and by switches inside the individual rooms.  Four exit doors are provided in the chlorine storage room, and three doors are located in the sulfur dioxide storage room.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe MAJSA has coordinated emergency response with the Luzerne County Emergency Management Agency (LCEMA).  The LCEMA has contracted with two local consulting firms to respond to emergencies at the treatment plant if MAJSA personnel cannot handle the emergency.  This plan was developed in accordance with the provisions set forth in Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986.  The plan is updated as necessary when equipment or operational changes take place at the facility.  Additionally, a yearly questionnaire is completed by MAJSA and submitted to LCEMA concerning changes that have taken place at the facility that could impact information contained in the Emergency Response Plan.  For example, this may include changes in the list of emergency telephone numbers.\n\nIf a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak develops in a ton-container or in the connected piping, valves, or other equipment, the chlorine or sulfur dioxide monitor will activate an audible alarm in the Operatio"

Audible as well as visual alarms are displayed on the control panel in the control room.  The treatment plant is manned five days per week (Monday through Friday) from 6:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  \n\nAfter hours, any system malfunction, including any chlorine or sulfur dioxide system leaks that are detected by the monitors and displayed on the control panel, automatically initiates a dial-up to an alarm center.  The alarm center then contacts the treatment plant personnel.  The treatment plant emergency operating procedures will be followed to determine the severity of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release.  The possibility of whether or not the gas may migrate off site will also be established.  If the release may travel off site, then the Off-site Response Plan will be activated.  If the chlorine release does not pose a threat to the general public, MAJSA personnel will repair the leak.  The MAJSA have installed a windsock near the Microstrainer Building so that the area that is likely to be affected by a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release can be determined.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Increase Safety\n\n* Increase the frequency of practice drills to respond to an accidental release of chlorine to three times per year.\n\n* Encourage the local volunteer fire companies to become more familiar with the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems at the treatment plant.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATE-CASE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as postulated in the regulation (40 CFR 68.25) is the release of the greatest quantity (of chlorine or sulfur dioxide) in a single vessel.  The entire contents of this vessel are to be released as a gas over a 10-minute period.

A release of this magnitude would only be possible if the shell of the container failed and the liquid formed a pool and vaporized over a 10-minute period.  The likelihood of this type of catastrophic release is minimal.  The off-site consequence of this type of release was determined by using U. S. EPA's RMP*Comp software.  \n\nAccording to U.S.EPA Accidental Release Prevention Program (40 CFR Part 68), the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm).  The RMP*Comp results indicate that the chlorine concentration may exceed 3 ppm out to a radial distance of 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage room.  This is the distance to the toxic endpoint.  Within a radius of 1.3 miles, there are 356 residences and a population of 1,046 based on Landview III results listed in Appendix A.  Landview III is a mapping system that includes database extracts from the U.S.EPA, the Bureau of Census, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  This mapping system identifies the location of schools, hospitals, and census information.  Beyond 1.3 miles, the chlorine concentration will be less than 3 ppm.  Short-term exposure to chlorine concentrations less than 3 ppm is not considered a health hazard.  \n\nThe RMP*Comp results for sulfur dioxide were the same as those obtained for chlorine.  The toxic endpoint for sulfur dioxide is also 3 ppm; therefore, the distance to the endpoint is also 1.3 miles.  Based on guidance provided in the regulation and U. S. EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the area surrounding the treatment plant was classified as urban.  This classification was due to the presence of nearby buildings and other structures, trees, and hilly terrain.

These stable atmospheric conditions will limit mixing of the ambient air with the released chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas.  Thus, the gas cloud will grow in size and decrease in concentration as it travels downwind from the point of release. \n\nAlternate-Release Scenario for Chlorine\n\nThe alternate release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  For this scenario, the release was from the 3/8-inch-diameter Type K copper tubing (pigtail) being sheared off and mitigation occurring in one hour.  This flexible tubing transfers liquid chlorine from the ton-container to the manifold.  The assumption is based on the alternate release scenarios listed in Edition 3 of The Chlorine Institute Pamphlet No. 74 - Estimating the Area Affected by a Chlorine Release, April 1998.  The entire contents of the one-ton container is released over a one-hour period resulting in a release rate for this scenario of 91 pounds per minute of chlorine.  \n\nFor this scenario, the meteorological conditions prescribed in the regulation are neutral atmospheric stability conditions (Class D) and wind speeds of 3 meters per second (6.7 miles per hour).  RMP*Comp was also used to determine the radial distance at which the chlorine concentration drops to less than the toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.  This distance to the toxic endpoint, as determined by RMP*Comp, is 0.20 miles (1,056 feet).  There are no schools or hospitals within this radial distance.  There are four residences and an estimated population of 17 within this radial distance. \n\nAlternate-Release Scenario for Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe alternate release scenario for sulfur dioxide also addresses the shearing of the 3/8-inch diameter flexible transfer hose.  This scenario results in a release rate of 21 pounds per minute of sulfur dioxide.  The dist"

Within this radial distance, there is one household and a total population of 4.\n\nThe worst-case and alternate release scenarios are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, along with some additional information regarding population estimates, schools, hospitals, and other buildings or recreation areas within the radial distance to the toxic endpoint.  Census data and the location of schools and hospitals were obtained from the LandView III mapping system.  A hardcopy of the Landview mapping system is included in Appendix A.  The Landview III mapping system program contains 1990 census information.  During the generation of this updated RMP Plan, an investigation was conducted to determine if an updated Landview III program containing 2000 census information was available.  An updated Landview III database was not available upon the completion of this report. \n\n\n\nTable 1 - Summary of the Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios for Chlorine\n\n\n\n                    Worst-Case Release        Alternate Release\n\nType of Accidental Release     Rupture of ton-container    Shearing of                                             3/8-inch copper                                             tubing\n\nQuantity of Chlorine Released    2,000 pounds            2,000 pounds\n\nDuration of Chlorine Release    10 minutes                60 minutes\n\nRate of Release of Chlorine Gas    200 lbs per minute    91 lbs per minute\n\nWind Speed                1.5 meters/second (3.36 mph)    3.0                                                     meters/second(6.7                                         mph)\n\nAtmospheric Stability Class    F (very stable)            D (neutral)\n\nMethod used to determine toxic endpoint    RMP*Comp            RMP*Comp\n\nChlorine concentration at endpoint    3 ppm                3 ppm)\n\nRadial distance to the toxic endpoint    1.3 miles (6,900 feet)    0.2 miles (528 feet)\n\nPopulation within radial distance        1,046                17\n\nNumber of residences            356                4\n\nNumber of hospitals                0                0\n\nNumber of schools                0                0\n\nOther Sensitive Areas        Interstate Highway 81    Interstate Highway 81\n\n\n\nTable 2 - Summary of the Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenarios f"
