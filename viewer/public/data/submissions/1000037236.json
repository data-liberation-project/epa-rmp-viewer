              "Description": "BD-5 and GHT Processes\n\n\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant (NCP) - East Site maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.\n\n \n\nThese policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.  The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's process units, including butylene storage.  Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n   \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place.  The mechanical integrity program includes, for example, ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment.  Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits  \n\n\n\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  \n\n\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nA RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report.   The RMP compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team's findings.  The two most recent RMP compliance audit reports are required to be retained.\n\n",

              "Description": "OL-5 Process\n\n\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant (NCP) - East Site maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.\n\n \n\nThese policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.  The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's process units, including butylene storage.  Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n   \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place.  The mechanical integrity program includes, for example, ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment.  Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits  \n\n\n\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  \n\n\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nA RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report.   The RMP compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team's findings.  The two most recent RMP compliance audit reports are required to be retained.\n\n",

              "Description": "GO-1 Process\n\n\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant (NCP) - East Site maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.\n\n \n\nThese policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.  The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's process units, including butylene storage.  Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n   \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place.  The mechanical integrity program includes, for example, ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment.  Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits  \n\n\n\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  \n\n\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nA RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report.   The RMP compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team's findings.  The two most recent RMP compliance audit reports are required to be retained.\n\n",

              "Description": "Utilities East\n\n\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant (NCP) - East Site maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program elements.\n\n \n\nThese policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site's existing safety programs and procedures.  The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe site has an employee participation plan that outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, for example, the site health and safety committee, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), incident investigation, and management of change activities.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) is conducted for a variety of the plant's process units, including butylene storage.  Typically, the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology is used to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members include operations, maintenance, and engineering personnel who are familiar with the process being reviewed.  PHA team recommendations are required to be tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  PHAs for covered process units are required to be revalidated every 5 years.  Process safety information is available to the PHA team for their use. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures address various operating phases, such as the following:  (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdowns, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  Operating procedures are available to all employees who work in or maintain a process, and the operating procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.  \n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nThe operator training program requires operators to complete operator training, including refresher training every three years.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their assigned process unit.  The operator training includes information related to unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions, including shutdown.  Operators must complete written and oral tests, as well as field demonstration of skills as part of the qualification training.  Operator training is required to be documented.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a contract coordinator.   The contractor selection process is based on a variety of data, such as contractor provided contractor safety programs and contractor performance information.  Contractor safety performance is also part of the weekly safety statistics. \n\n   \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nA PSSR procedure is in place and requires a PSSR be conducted for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMechanical integrity procedures and practices related to maintaining the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems are in place.  The mechanical integrity program includes, for example, ongoing inspection and testing (and resolution of inspection results, as applicable) of various types of process equipment.  Also, quality assurance practices are used, as applicable, to verify their suitability for the process application for which they will be used. \n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits  \n\n\n\nA variety of safe work practices are in place that apply to employees and contractors, as applicable.  Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:  (1) control of entry into a stationary source site by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel; (2) equipment lockout/tagout; (3) opening process equipment or piping; (4) the issuance of hot work permits; and (5) the issuance of entry permits for entry into confined spaces, as applicable.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe management of change procedure is designed to manage various types of changes to process chemicals, process technology, equipment, and procedures and changes to stationary sources that affect a covered process.  The procedure is designed to confirm review of the technical basis of the proposed change, the impact of the change on process related safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  The procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance and contractor employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nIncident investigation procedures are in place for the investigation of RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The investigation team's recommendations are required to be tracked to resolution and documented.  The RMP incident investigation results are required to be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable.  \n\n\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nA RMP Compliance audit is required to be conducted every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit team's findings developed in a report.   The RMP compliance audit report is required to be reviewed to promptly determine and document resolution of the audit team's findings.  The two most recent RMP compliance audit reports are required to be retained.\n\n",

Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario - Cyclohexylamine\n\n\n\nThe only regulated toxic substance located at the facility stored both in quantities and concentrations greater than the respective threshold quantity is cyclohexylamine, which is contained in the BW-8192 boiler water treatment mixture at the Utilities - East storage area.  An estimated maximum of 70,000 pounds of BW-8192 is in various containers within the area of which 50% by weight is cyclohexylamine, resulting in a total of 35,000 pounds of cyclohexylamine that could potentially be discharged in the event of a catastrophic accidental release within this area.  The scenario results in a toxic endpoint distance of 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers).\n\n\n\nThis worst-case scenario has the potential to impact an estimated population of 3,639 people (1,444) residences.  Multiple schools including Norco Elementary, Sacred Heart of Jesus, and Bethune High School could be impacted by this scenario.

The rupture (cyclohexylamine toxic alternative-case scenario) results in a toxic endpoint distance of 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers).  \n\n\n\nThis alternative-case scenario has the potential to impact a minimal population in general.  Landview 6 does not indicate any offsite receptors that will be impacted; however, it does not take into account that the facility also encompasses the MNR and Shell Norco Chemical Plant - West Site (SNCP-ES) and employees at each of these facilities could be impacted.  No schools or hospitals should be affected by this release.\n\n\n\n3. Flammable Worst-Case Release Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the instantaneous failure, release, and vapor cloud explosion of 8,000,000 lbs of a flammable mixture (butane, 1,3-butadiene, isopentane, and pentane) from a process vessel in the OL-5 process.  Although the vessel normally operates with liquid filled to 50% capacity, there are no procedures to regulate inventory.  Therefore, the vessel was assumed full per the RMP requirements for WCS analysis.  No passive (i.e. containment) mitigation credit was applied to the release model calculations.  The release calculation also assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers). A population estimate of 4,420 people off-site, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.

Flammable Alternative Release Scenario - Propylene\n\n\n\nThe alternative flammable scenario involves the release of 40,000 lbs of propylene and a subsequent vapor cloud explosion resulting from a valve stem blowout on a 48 inch power assisted check valve downstream of a propylene compressor.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  The modeling scenario also assumes a 5 minute release duration before the explosion occurs.  This scenario was selected because of a 1997 incident in the industry involving a similar event in an identical process.  It is assumed that release detection would be immediate due to the noise generated by a high pressure release.  Operator intervention is assumed to deactivate the compressor to stop the flow of propylene, as well as activate area firewater monitors to contain any fire and cool equipment.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.3 miles (0.4 kilometers).  This alternative-case scenario has the potential to impact approximately 33 people (13 residences).  No schools or hospitals should be affected by this release."
