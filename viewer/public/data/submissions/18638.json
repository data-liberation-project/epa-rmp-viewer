Trained operators are working with operating instructions and process safety\ninformation to keep the process operation safe and in environmental compliance.  The second level\ninvolves technical controls.  Control systems and instrumentation provide the tools to maintain the\nprocess within these limits.

Chemical safety is a number one priority with support from the highest level of\nmanagement.  The Environmental and Safety Department reports directly to the Vice President,\nwho reports directly to the CEO and President. Thus Senior Management promotes safety and\nenvironmental compliance.\n\n     There are many programs in place to promote chemical safety and the facility is usually\nsubjected to at least four surprise inspections a year by different governmental agencies.  The\nhazardous waste incineration industry is one of the most highly regulated in the country.  Not\nonly does LWD comply with numerous Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs such as Risk Management Plan (RMP), it\nalso complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) programs, Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) programs, the Emergency\nPlanning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) programs, State and Local Fire Code\nprograms, and the National Electrical Code programs.   To even further promote chemical safety, the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs Process Safety Management\n(PSM) and Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) also regulates the\nfacility. \n\n     As part of the RMP and PSM programs, LWD's chemical safety program begins with quality\nassurance for all equipment, piping systems, storage tanks, relief and vent systems, controls,\nemergency systems, and pumps.  This guarantees that these units meet all applicable design\ncodes and specifications.  Thi"

LWD is also a member of\nthe Coalition for Responsible Waste Incineration in which detailed safety and compliance\ninformation is shared to further promote the safe and effective thermal treatment of hazardous\nwastes.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     The facility, which is located in Calvert City, KY, includes three hazardous waste\nincinerators and affiliated hazardous waste storage facilities.  Many of the chemical safety\nprocedures mentioned previously are designed specifically for chemicals handled by the facility,\nwhich include familiar household products such as paints, adhesives, herbicides, pesticides,\ncleaners, and solvents.  Specifically, the Risk Management Chemicals at the LWD facility include\nHydrogen Fluoride, Formaldehyde, Isobutane, Butadiene and Vinyl Methyl Ether.  Many of these\nitems would be immediately recognizable by the average individual if trade names were used instead of\nchemical names.  The major difference is the volume of waste that a household would produce versus\nan industrial application.  Where a household would have a gallon of drain cleaner stored in a safe\nplace away from the reach of small children, LWD would have hundreds of gallons stored in a safe\nplace away from persons unaware of the hazards.  Chemicals such as hydrogen fluoride, commonly\nused as a wheel cleaner or an oven cleaner, and isobutane, which is a common non-CFC aerosol\npropellant, are included in the release scenarios for the Risk Management Plan.  Just as in a\nhousehold, these chemicals are not always present.

Using the\nmethods specified by EPA, the vaporized HF would exceed the plant's boundaries.  The worst\ncase scenario as defined by EPA for the RMP rule does not allow for any active action to prevent the\nrelease.  It also assumes worst case conditions for the release in its calculations.  There are many\nactive control systems, described previously, to prevent an incident from occurring.   The main\ncontrol and safety systems in place to prevent such an incident include: pressure testing the\nproduct line before each use; a continuous process area monitor; personal monitors while hooking and\nunhooking the product lines; special indicator paint; DOT inspections of the container in which\nthe material is received; pressure vents; check valves; and continuous camera monitoring of the\ncontainer.   Although these safety systems are in place, the worst case scenario does not take into\naccount any of the responses which may be performed by the trained operators.\n\n     The flammable worst case scenario chemical examined is Isobutane.

Using EPA's Guidance and Reference Tables/Equations, the endpoints exceed the plant boundaries, but do not exceed the\nindustrial complex in which the facility is located and do not affect any residential area.  Passive\nmitigation was used in the alternative case for formaldehyde since the storage tanks have secondary containment.  Although there are active controls and measures directed at preventing\nand controlling the consequences of such releases, no credit was taken for active mitigation methods in\nevaluating these alternative scenarios.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps   \n\n     LWD has a general accident release prevention program which includes extensive classroom\nand on the job training for all its employees.  This training also requires each employee take a\ncompetency exam.  This program instructs the employee in safe working practices, ranging from\nthe proper operation of a fork lift to the process operations.  Monthly training on various topics,\nranging from sampling of materials to hot work permits, keeps safety and environmental compliance\nparamount in the minds of the employees.  All employees are required to attend an annual 8 hour\nrefresher training class with competency testing.
