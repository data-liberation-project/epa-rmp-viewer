Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sun Pacific Reedley has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sun Pacific Reedley, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sun Pacific Reedley has updated/ their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\r\n\r\n1.2 Process Description\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley operates a commercial cold storage facility in Reedley, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n\r\n(9) Cold Rooms\r\n(3) Hallways\r\n(1) Loading Dock\r\n\r\nThe cold rooms, hallways and loading docks are equipped with air cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation..\r\n\r\nMost control valve groups are located in the center hall (catwalk) to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within two refrigeration machinery rooms (north and south) or directly above each machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\r\n\r\nMachinery Room\r\n(4) Screw Compressors\r\n(4) Oil Separators\r\n(4) Oil Coolers\r\n(1) Main Suction Accumulator\r\n(2) Liquid Transfer Vessel\r\n(1) Thermosyphon Vessel\r\n(1) High Pressure Receiver\r\n(4) Evaporative Condensers\r\n\r\nCold Rooms\r\n(38) Bunker Coils\r\n(6) Ceiling-suspended Evaporators\r\n(25) Accumulators\r\n\r\nLoading Dock\r\n(3) Ceiling-suspended Units\r\n(3) Accumulators\r\n\r\nHallways\r\n(7) Ceiling-suspended Units\r\n(7) Accumulators\r\n\r\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each area, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator. From the accumulator, low pressure liquid is circulated through the evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessel. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction re"

The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the thermosyphon vessel and then to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at Sun Pacific Reedley consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Sun Pacific Reedley is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Sun Pacific Reedley facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 39,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia lea"

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Sun Pacific Reedley in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Sun Pacific Reedley continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Sun Pacific Reedley's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Sun Pacific Reedley's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSun Pacific Reedley has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Sun Pacific Reedley employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Sun Pacific Reedley will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
