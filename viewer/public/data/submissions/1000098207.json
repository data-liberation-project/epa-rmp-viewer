This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration system.  Only a trained operators and a licensed refrigeration contractor is permitted to perform system operations.  Thrifty PayLess, Inc., Inc. has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThrifty PayLess, Inc. is located at 9200 Telstar Avenue in El Monte, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration system to provide cooling for the storage of various food products.  The maximum inventory of ammonia (anhydrous) is 40,700 pounds and is contained within a single, 2 stage, refrigeration system serving the various production and process areas within the Thrifty Ice Cream, El Monte ice cream plant.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrifty PayLess, Inc. has developed an accidental release prevention program for compliance with the EPA regulations.  The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n?    Safety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the equipment;\n\n?    Written procedures for operating and maintaining the process;\n\n?    Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n?    Written procedures for safely introducing modifications to the covered process;\n\n?    "

Written procedures for conducting hot work on or near the covered process;\n\n?    Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises;\n\n?    Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations; and\n\n?    Employee involvement in program development and implementation. \n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThrifty PayLess, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with an ammonia release and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the e"

The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Thrifty PayLess, Inc. has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
