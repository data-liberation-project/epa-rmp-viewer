The Facility uses one regulated substance, chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) as a disinfectant\nto treat potable water during the chlorination process.  Chlorine is also used for hydrogen sulfide\nremoval in the packed towers.  The chlorination process consists of chlorine storage and the\nchlorination system.  The chlorination process begins with the withdrawal of chlorine from the\nchlorine cylinders under positive pressure.  The chlorine gas travels through black iron pipes to\nchlorinators, where the chlorine supply is regulated and measured.  At the chlorinators, the pressure\nis reduced to a vacuum by the flow of influent through the injectors.  Chlorine is mixed with effluent\nwater by chlorine injectors to produce a solution which is injected into the water supply for\ndisinfection.  For hydrogen removal, chlorine gas is transferred to the scrubbing towers where it is\ndissolved in the scrubbing solution.\n\nThe hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination process using the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case release scenario\nwas assumed to be the release of a one ton cylinder for a duration of 10 minutes in an enclosed\nbuilding.  The alternative release scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed\nduring the process hazard review and analysis.  In this scenario, a 3/8-inch diameter whip connecting\na one-ton cylinder to the chlorination manifold is sheared off, creating a leak in the system.  The\nFacility has the capability of responding to and stopping the leak within one hour of detection.  For\nboth scenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors could be potentially\nimpacted by the release of chlorine.  Although off-site areas would be impacted, we believe that\nsafety procedures a"

Our safety devices include chlorine leak detectors,\nalarms, and an automatic system shut-off feature triggered by a loss in system vacuum from the\nchlorinators to its point of application.  In addition, the chlorine cylinders are housed in a building\nwith exhaust fans and vents which would dilute the chlorine gas concentration should a release\noccur.\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP.  The prevention program\nensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental release\nof chlorine is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an accidental\nrelease due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the release of\nchlorine due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operating procedures are current\nand reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and contractors\nworking near or on the chlorination process are required to be trained in the chlorination process and\nthe hazards of chlorine.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance in accordance with accepted engineering\npractices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine cylinders are examined upon\ndelivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment pertaining to the\nchlorine process is visually inspected daily.  The potential for a chlorine release is greatly reduced\nfrom the chlorinators to the injectors in the chlorination process due to the use of a vacuum system. "

      "SummaryText": "\nIn the event of an equipment failure resulting in a loss of vacuum from the chlorinators to the point\nof application, the chlorinators will automatically shutoff (i.e. failsafe).  \n\nAll existing and proposed future chlorination equipment have been designed according to applicable\nstandards and codes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection\nand tests.  Precautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested,\nthat all changes on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the chlorination\nprocess and to evaluate and control where the potential for a chlorine release exists.  Employees were\ninvolved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  It was recommended\nthat automatic shutoff valves be placed on the cylinders to reduce the potential for a chlorine release\nfrom the cylinders to the chlorinators.  The automatic shutoff valves will shutdown the chlorination\nsystem if there is a leak at the chlorine cylinders.  It is anticipated that the automatic shutoff valves\nwill be installed by June 21, 1999. \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at our facility.  Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.  We have\ndeveloped many different forms to assist employees in recording and documenting the various\nelements of the RMP. \n\nAt the time of the submittal of this Risk Management Plan, there have been no accidental releases\nof chlorine at our facility in the past five years.  However, in the event that there is an accidental\nrelease of chlorine, an Emergency Action Plan has been written in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.38. \nThe Facility is also included in the community emergency response plan.

Therefore,\nin accordance with 40 CFR 68.90, an Emergency Response Program is not required for our facility. \nIn the event that a chlorine release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the process area\nand report the incident.  The emergency action plan consists of evacuation procedures, facility\nemergency numbers, and coordination with Valdosta Fire Department.
