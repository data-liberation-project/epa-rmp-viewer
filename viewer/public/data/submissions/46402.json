ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nManagement of the Gold Kist Northeast Alabama Division processing plant in Guntersville (GK- Guntersville) is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental protection.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program which includes equipment design and installation, operating and maintenance procedures and employee training.  Our employees implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, trained emergency response personnel are present to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the Guntersville Fire Department for additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nGK- Guntersville is a poultry processing plant which uses one regulated substances, ammonia, in its operations.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to ensure wholesome products.  \n\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS  \nThis information is available for review at the facility.\n\n4.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe GK- Guntersville facility is in compliance with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The refrigeration system is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and  subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.   The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION-\nDetailed records of safety information which describe chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all operations are maintained at the facility.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\nPersonnel "
