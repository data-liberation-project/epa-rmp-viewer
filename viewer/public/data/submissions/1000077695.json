The Corning WWTP has developed and maintains written safety\n\ninformation about the chlorination and de-chlorination process and the technology of process\n\nequipment used. The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and\n\nto the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management. Process Safety Information is\n\nreadily available to all personnel and is updated when changes are made.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)The original PHA review was conducted in June 2009 appropriate to the\n\ncomplexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards\n\nusing the What-If Checklist and a Hazard Review Checklists processes. These processes\n\ninclude the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error. It describes steps\n\nused to detect and monitor releases. This PHA will be updated every three years and the Corning WWTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n\nOperating Procedures. The WWTP plant operator has prepared written standard operating\n\nprocedures specific to their operations that provide clear instructions for the safe operational\n\nactivities associated with the process. These procedures are included in the facility operations\n\nmanual and the Process Safety Management manual. The manual includes procedures for\n\noperation of all phases of the processes, and normal and emergency shutdown of the process.\n\nThese procedures will be reviewed and updated if necessary on an annual basis.

The WWTP has a preventive maintenance program that insures the mechanical integrity of its chlorination / de-chlorination processing equipment,\n\nwhich includes periodic inspection, testing and an annual overhaul of critical processing equipment.\n\nMaintenance procedures are written for each step of the maintenance process and assigned to\n\nappropriate personnel.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) The WWTP has implemented written MOC procedures to\n\nmanage changes (except changes in-kind) to process chemical technology, equipment and\n\nprocedures. Employees affected by a change in a process are informed of and trained in the\n\nchange prior to start up of the process or affected part of the process.
