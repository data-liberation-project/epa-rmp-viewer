Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nContinental Cement Company, L.L.C. (CCC) is strongly committed to protection of its employees, the public and the environment.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is CCC?s policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, CCC has an emergency plan in place that is coordinated with the City of Hannibal Fire Department, the Hannibal Rural Fire Department and Marion-Ralls County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  These local agencies provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \nCCC receives a mixture of solvents used as alternate fuel materials to replace use of coal.  Compounds in the fuel mixture currently do not exceed the threshold quantity for any substance listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  Therefore, CCC is not required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act.  However, the potential to exceed these threshold quantities does exist.  If the concentration of substances in future alternative fuel material changes, threshold quantities can be exceeded.  CCC routinely tests and closely monitors the quantities of these substances.  Therefore, CCC is submitting this RMP to insure that we are in compliance and that our neighbors are aware of our worst case emergency scenario.  \n \n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nCCC is a portland cement manufacturer located approximately 3 miles south of downtown Hannibal, Missouri.  The original cement manufacturing facility was constructed in 1905.  The"

      "SummaryText": " facility was continuously upgraded and enlarged to its current capacity.  The rotary cement kiln currently on-line was erected in 1966.  In 1986, CCC was granted interim status under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to operate an alternative fuel facility.  A mixture of various substances, regulated as hazardous waste primarily due to flammability, are received, stored and prepared for use as fuel in the cement kiln.  These alternative fuels burn cleaner than coal and serve as a direct replacement of coal.  The alternative fuels consist of spent products such as paints, inks, solvents, oil, and other flammable or combustible organic materials.   Both solid and liquid alternative fuels are received.\nCCC tests these fuels regularly to determine concentrations and quantities of regulated substances as defined by our permit.  Since testing began, CCC has found that only one test period showed a concentration of a regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  This period occurred three years ago with the fuel material present on-site for less than one week.  Ethyl ether was observed in the storage tanks at a level of 16,100 lbs.  The regulated inventory of Ethyl ether is 10,000 lbs.  Therefore, CCC has based this ?Predictive Filing? Risk Management Plan on the storage and processing of a flammable material, ethyl ether, assuming that it may be received in the future above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n3.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our site.  Our site is considered a stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes ?what if? assessments followed by written response procedures.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, safety and process operations and are revalidated every year as part of our RCRA Contingency Plan.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, CCC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup for annual maintenance activities.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that all employees operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided to all employees every year and more frequently as needed.  Documentation on training is maintained, reported to EPA/MDNR during quarterly inspections of the facility.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCCC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n \nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at CCC to manage changes in alternative fuel materials, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at CCC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCCC conducts audits, using third party auditors, on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under environmental regulations are being implemented.  These audits are carried out every year and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCCC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
