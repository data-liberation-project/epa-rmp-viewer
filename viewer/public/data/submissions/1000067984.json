      "SummaryText": "1.1    Accidental Release Prevention And Response Policies\n\nRedcliff Midstream places the highest priority on the safety of the public, the employees and the environment, and is committed to meeting the most stringent safety standards for assets, operations and personnel. This commitment is demonstrated by the consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes and by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, written procedures, routine maintenance and inspection programs.\n\n\n\n1.2    Description Of The Facility And Regulated Substances\n\nThe Redcliff Gas Plant is a 200 MMSCFD cryogenic gas plant. Natural gas enters the plant at 1000 psig and any liquid that condensed in the inlet pipelines, known as condensate, is separated using a Harp-style slug catcher.\n\nLiquid from the Harp is processed in a condensate stabilization unit to produce a stabilized condensate and Y-grade NGL product. Process gas from the Harp is treated to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water prior to entering the Cryo Plant.\n\nThe Cryo Plant is a gas subcooled process (GSP) with refrigeration in which gas is initially cooled using heat integration/recovery from a series of heat exchangers. Use of a turboexpander and reflux exchanger enables the process temperature to be reduced to as low as -150 ?F. A Demethanizer splits the gas into a liquefied Y-Grade NGL product stream containing nearly all ethane and heavier components while simultaneously distilling the product to remove all residual methane which is rejected out of the tower to be sold as sales gas. The NGL stream is pumped to pipeline pressure and marketed to interstate pipelines. The residue gas stream is compressed, filtered, and delivered to transmission lines and sold as sales gas.\n\n\n\nThe listed flammable substances over the threshold of the 40 CFR Part 68 at the Redcliff Midstream facility are: Butane, Ethane, i-Butane, i-Pentane, Methane, n-Pentane and"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Responsibility for maintaining process safety information are assigned in order to keep them current and up to date. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). \n\nProcess parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and pressure) have been identified in order to operate the process safely.\n\n\n\nTechnical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment are also maintained. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.\n\n\n\n1.3.2    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. PHAs are conducted to identify potential safety and operability hazards associated with the operation and maintenance of the Canyon Midstream Redcliff Plant Project and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA findings are implemented and tracked to completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal cor"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\n1.3.4    Training\n\nA comprehensive training program is maintained for all employees involved in operating a process. Each employee is trained in an overview of the process and in the operating procedures. Special emphasis is given on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks.\n\n\n\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n1.3.5    Mechanical Integrity\n\nTo help ensure covered process equipment is maintained in a safe and reliable condition, procedures and practices are established to include: pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. The basic aspects of the Mechanical Integrity program include: training, written procedures, inspections and tests, correcting identified deficiencies, and applying quality assurance measures. \n\n\n\n1.3.6    Management of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes to the covered process.

Hazard reviews are conducted to verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated as necessary to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\n1.3.7    Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nThe Redcliff Midstream facility conducts PSSRs when existing facilities/processes are modified and require a change in the process safety information. The intent of the PSSR is to confirm that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; and that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate.\n\n\n\n1.3.8    Compliance Audits.\n\nTo determine whether the procedures and practices required by the Accident Prevention Program are being implemented, the Redcliff facility periodically conducts audits, and formal compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Findings from the compliance audits are documented in the facility corrective action tracking database and tracked to completion. The two most recent audit reports are retained for review.\n\n\n\n1.3.9    Incident Investigation\n\nThe Redcliff Midstream facility has established a formal incident reporting and investigation process to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, chemical release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
