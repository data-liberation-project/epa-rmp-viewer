Perth Amboy Terminal is capable of storing a variety of petroleum products including several grades of gasoline and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) as well as ethanol in approximately 46 large above-ground storage tanks. Perth Amboy Terminal also operates a butane process that allows butane to be offloaded from tanker trucks, stored in pressurized vessels, and blended into gasoline tanks. Perth Amboy Terminal is located at 380 Maurer Road, Perth Amboy, NJ 08861, on the west bank of the Arthur Kill approximately two miles north of its entrance to the Raritan Bay and encompasses approximately 272 acres.\n\nBuckeye is committed to operating Perth Amboy Terminal in a safe, reliable, and environmentally sound manner. Buckeye believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably and that outstanding HSE performance is of paramount importance. Buckeye promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Buckeye has designed and implemented, including:\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals\nD. An overview of the emergency response program\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety\n\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Perth Amboy Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Perth Amboy Terminal.\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in three (3) storage vessels. The butane is pumped to a blending manifold for direct injection into atmospheric gasoline tanks. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION MEASURES\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning and response programs help to effectively manage the hazards posed by regulated substances to employees, the public, and the environment. The covered process is regulated by the EPA RMP regulation 40 CFR Part 68, the NJDEP TCPA N.J.A.C. Title 7 Chapter 31, as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following accident prevention program elements are in place at the Perth Amboy Terminal:\n\n01) Employee Partic"

Buckeye is committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, Buckeye also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These are briefly summarized as follows:\n\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\n\n- Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards\n- Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.)\n- Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams\n- Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators\n- Computerized monitoring and control of process operation\n- Redundant control systems\n- Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems\n- Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices\n- Limited facility access\n- Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs\n- Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits\n- Frequent unit surveillance by operators\n\nGeneral Release Mitigation\n\n- Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity\n- Strategically located valves to isolate leaks\n- Hydrocarbon detectors at key areas to warn of a chemical release\n- Fire monitors installed near butane offlo"

In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of butane, if a release does occur, a Facility Response Plan (FRP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Perth Amboy Fire Department and Middlesex County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nC. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Perth Amboy Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention. The terminal keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. There have been no accidents within the past five (5) years resulting from the chemical release of materials covered under the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nD. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPerth Amboy Terminal maintains a Facility Respons Plan (FRP) that details the response activities expected of employees and provides emergency contact information. Employees at Perth Amboy Terminal are trained in incipient stage response activities, however, the expected response for a larger emergency is to contact the Perth Amboy Fire Department to request their assistance and evacuate. Emergency response is coordinated with the Perth Amboy Fire Department annually and the department is invited to the Facility to participate in annual emergency response drills.\n\nE.
