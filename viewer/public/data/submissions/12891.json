We have facilities located in six states in the greater New England region, massing over 5million square feet of distribution warehouses.  C&S Wholesale Grocers management team understands the responsibility in protecting its employees, and surrounding environmental receptors.  The continued safety of all persons within the property boundaries and adjacent receptors will continue to be a priority of our maintenance and engineering team.  This facility incorporates a proactive and reactive emergency response program encompassing both systems to mitigate accidental releases, and preventative measures.  This program is designed and maintained in accordance with Osiers existing Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals, 29CFR1910.119 and new EPAs Risk Management Program regulation under, 40CPRPart 68.\nThe V.P. of Maintenance and Engineering is responsible for the management of the prevention and emergency response programs.    The design and management of our programs has been facilitated by both in-house and outsourced professionals.  Its purpose is to prevent and plan for the occurrence of a significant release.  The programs intent and application is to effectively minimize the consequences of  a significant release of hazardous and potentially toxic substances. \n\nFacility Overview and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n    The facility located at the above-mentioned address, is subject to Program 3 of the EPAs RM Program.  The facility encompasses approximately 345,000 square feet of  ammonia refrigerated warehouse.  This facility contains a maximum inventory of 56000lbs of anhydrous ammonia.\n(CAS # 7662-41-7).

The system is used to control various temperatures of food products located within the facility.  The system is controlled by a central computer command center and monitored at all times for specified points.  The system can be controlled both at the central computer, and remotely via modem ports.  The use of ammonia sensors within the engine rooms and immediate area are connected to a alarm system and corresponding alert system.  All responsible parties are notified via telecommunication systems, beepers and pagers from a central monitoring station. \n\nSummary of Worst-Case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nThe information contained within the scenarios provided has been used for its probability and potential of an actual occurrence.  After developing several potential scenarios for each area, the worst case model of each required scenario was used for this filing.  The commitment of C&S is to take the, high road in regards to its safety programs and implementations of OSHA and EPA guidelines.  It is believed that the safest approach is not only best but required.  The modeling software utilized for this submission is, RMP COMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n \n    The worst case scenario for this facility involves the release of 27,800 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, under a release rate of  1530 lbs/min. within an enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air due to a failure within the high pressure receiver.  The modeling software utilized for this scenario, RMP COMP, has used a release duration of 10min, liquefied under pressure, with a with speed of 3.4 MPH, a stability class of F with an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  The resulting ammonia could travel 2.2 miles in a described rural area before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.
