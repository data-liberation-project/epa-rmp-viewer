The facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which has been written in accordance with OSHA PSM requirements. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. The Latham Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (i.e. Fire Department). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident."

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Latham Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant has safety features designed to help:\r\n(1) contain/control a release;\r\n(2) quickly detect a release, and;\r\n(3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\r\n\r\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\r\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\r\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\r\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\r\n\r\nChanges are reviewed to:\r\n(1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and\r\n(2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\r\n\r\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of operations such as:\r\n(1) Normal startup,\r\n(2) Normal operations,\r\n(3) Temporary operations,\r\n(4) Emergency shutdown,\r\n(5) Normal shutdown,\r\n(6) Startup following an emergency shutdown, and\r\n(7) Initial startup of a new process.\r\n\r\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Covered process operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s) and maintain the covered process unit within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operation is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon"

      "SummaryText": "acility maintains the process within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Latham Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. The facility periodically updates and re-validates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and identify new potential hazards. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years an"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - LATHAM GAS PLANT\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant is committed to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEmployees of the Latham Gas Plant are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Latham Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The f"
