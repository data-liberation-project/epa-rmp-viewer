The policy complies with all pertinent procedures of the U.S. Environmentla Protection Agency(EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Program.  The City of Dunedin emergency response policy involves the preparation of site specific response plans, taking into consideration the available emergency response services surrounding each facility.  The emergency response policy is in accordance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  B.  The City of Dunedin Reverse Osmosis Water Treatment Plant(WTP) is located at 1401 County Road 1 in the City of Dunedin, Pinellas County, Florida.  The WTP employs reverse osmosis treatment processes to remove dissolved solids and impurities from the water and disinfects it with chlorine.  Disinfection of all public water supplies is necessary to prevent waterborne diseases such as cholera, thypoid and dysentery.  The WTP contains a chlorination room which houses the three chlorinators and various process piping; an outdoor, open roofed chlorine storage area with up to eight ton chlorine containers and assorted safety equipment.  The operations room containing flow and turbidity recorders, various electricsl panels, and additional safety equipment is located approximately 200 feet away from the chlorination room.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  C.  The offsite consequence analysis takes into consideration two chlorine release scenarios, specified as \"worst case release\" and alternative scenario\".  The \"worst case\" is defined by the EPA as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance (chlorine gas) from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint\".  The \"alternative scenario\"is defined as the \"more probable\" scenario of a failure, than is the \"worst case release\".  The worst case release scenario at the Dunedin "

      "SummaryText": "WTP involves the release of one, one-ton cylinder of chlorine outdoors.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario is determined based on predefined conditions set by EPA.  The general conditions are as follows: the release of the entire contents from the cylinder as a gas in 10 minutes, an atmospheric stability class of F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, ambient temperature of 25 degrees Celcius, and a relative humidity of 50 percent.  The conditions surrounding the Dunedin WTP are defined as \"urban\" by the EPA.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 1.3 miles.  The case study for the alternative release scenarioinvolves the failure to the 5/16th inch gas valve to close.  It is assumed that chlorine detectors alert the WTP operators to the release.  The amount of chlorine released is equal to 2000 pounds released at an average rate corresponding to the 5/16th inch hole, which equates to a release rate of 240 lb/min.  The entire contents of the cylinder are released in 8.3 minutes.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles.  D.  The City of Dunedin accidental release prevention program consists of the following elements: (1) The ongoing and continuous training of operators, (2) A preventative maintenance program that follows the manufacturers specifications and acceptable engineering practices, (3) The implementation of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment, (4) Ongoing equipment and hazard reviews, (5) The use of current operations and maintenance manuals, and (6) Continued equipment inspections.  The City of Dunedin has also included the following chemical specific prevention steps: (1) The use chlorine leak detectors, (2) The use of self contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA) when handling chlorine containers, and (3) All operators have been trained to be aware of the hazardous effects and toxic properties of chlorine.  E.  The Dunedin WTP has experienced no accidental releases of chlorine over the past 5 years.  F.  The"
