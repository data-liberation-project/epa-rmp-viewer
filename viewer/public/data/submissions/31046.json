In the event that an accidential release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire department, emergency response personel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment. \n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity of our facility is the production of liquid micronutrients for crop production.The raw materials used in production includes the receiving,storage,and use of ammonia concentrate of 20 percent or greater CAS # 7664417 which is included in the EPA  Risk Management Program. This raw material is the subject of this plan and our only raw material on the list used by this facility. The on site amount of ammonia is much lower during our off season of July thru October. Our facility has adequate lighting and is inspected during use and off season.\n\nAccidential Release Program\nOur accidential release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and OSHA Standards for handling of ammonia. Additionly we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling,storage and use of ammonia.We installed preasure release valves,diking,and a scrubber on the liquid mixer to help avoid any accidental release of fumes. We also maintain contact with our local fire department and LEPC to update any changes in our operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nWe have not had a release of ammonia within the past five years that has caused death,injury or significant property damage at this facility. To our knowledge we have not caused any off site deaths, injury, evacuation,sheltering in place,property damage or envirmental damage.\n\n Emergency Response Program \n This facility is included in the writt"
