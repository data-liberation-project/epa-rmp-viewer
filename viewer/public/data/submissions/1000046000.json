      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN DAYTON - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n \n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Huntsman Dayton Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  Huntsman Dayton Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Dayton Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.\n\n \n\n2.  Regulated Substances.  Huntsman Dayton Plant is located about five miles west of Dayton, Texas.  The Dayton Plant takes raw materials and uses batch operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Dayton Plant now has only 3 regulated substances at the facility:\n\nThe three toxic substances are:\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO) - Used to manufacture printed circuit boards and in water treating chemicals.\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO) - Used in making non-toxic solvents and in food preservation.\n\nEthylenediamine (EDA) - Used in textile softeners and in oil field applications.\n\n\n\n3.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \n\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman Dayton Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nHuntsman's Dayton Plant maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and understand the hazards of the process.  This includes information pertaining to:\n\nHazards of regulated"

The Dayton Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  The Dayton Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific processes.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time.  The Huntsman Dayton Plant completes a PHA Revalidation every 5-years (or less) meeting the requirements of the PSM and RMP Standards.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to "

All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are updated.\n\n  \n\nPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.

Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\n \n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Dayton Plant establishes an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.  Huntsman Dayton Plant has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution.  Finally, incident reports are available electronically to all plant personnel.\n\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nHuntsman Dayton Plant has developed a written action plan for employee participation in all aspects of its Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.
