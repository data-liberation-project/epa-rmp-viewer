We are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur it is our policy to notify Gretna Fire & Rescue and request they respond to the emergency.\n     The primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. The facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis  with employees on site during the receiving and loading out of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Total Annual hours to meet these needs do not add up to the 2,080 hour requirement to meet the \"full time\" employee on site, therefore item # 1.11 is Zero. The maximum intended inventory of our anhydrous ammonia tanks is 475,000 pounds, includes permanent storage and nurse tanks.\n     We used RMP Comp to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  Failure of my largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  The alternate release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.\n     The facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The Facility has implemented trhe provisions of\"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational safety and health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n     We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injur"
