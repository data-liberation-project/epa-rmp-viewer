      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION:  Cooper Natural Resources and its predecessor companies have produced the industrial mineral, sodium sulfate, from underground brine deposits in west Texas since 1933. Their Cedar Lake Plant, located in northeastern Gaines County, has been in operation since 1965. The sodium sulfate produced by the plant is a high purity, non-hazardous salt that is shipped to customers throughout the United States for use in the detergent, glass, paper, dyestuffs, and animal husbandry industries. The plant is supplied by shallow wells located in the adjacent, highly saline, Cedar Lake. The produced brine is over nine times the salinity of seawater. This brine is conveyed to the plant by pipelines. Refrigeration Units in the plant are then used to cool the brine and cause the precipitation of the hydrous form of sodium sulfate, Glauber's salt, Na2SO4X10H2O. The Refrigeration system contains approximately 69,500 lbs. of ammonia. The hydrous salt produced by refrigeration is then recovered by filtration and sent to the drying plant where a vapor recompression unit melts the salt in its waters of hydration. The concentration of the saturated solution results in the precipitation of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the marketable product. The anhydrous sodium sulfate is subsequently recovered by centrifuges and dried prior to shipment. No reagents or reactive chemistries are used in the process. The method of operation is based on simple phase chemistry alone. The plant produces high purity sodium sulfate salt ultra-pure steam condensate. \n\n\n\nPROGRAM STATUS: Program Status\n\nAs more fully described herein, the plant meets the eligibility requirements of Program 3 status as provided in Appendix A 40 CFR 68.10(d) of the RMP Rule because it meets all the following requirements.\n\n(1) The facility process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n(2) The distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint for a worst-c"

      "SummaryText": "ase release assessment conducted under Subpart B and 68.25 of this part is more than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in 68.30 of this \n\n    part.  \n\n   \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT, RELEASE SCENARIOS:  A hazard Assessment for the Offsite Consequence Analysis for both a Worst-Case and Alternative Accidental Release Scenario for the facility has been conducted using the EPA's RMP*Comp Software.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: Because anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance, the plant is also covered by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM). CNR Cedar Lake Facility has built its Accidental Release Prevention Program to include the required items for a Program Level 3 found in Appendix A  40 CFR 68 Subpart D which includes the following:\n\no    68.65      Process Safety Information (PSI)\n\no    68.67      Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\no    68.69      Operating Procedures\n\no    68.71      Training\n\no    68.73      Mechanical Integrity\n\no    68.75      Management of Change\n\no    68.77      Pre-startup Review \n\no    68.79      Compliance Audits\n\no    68.81      Incident Investigation\n\no    68.83      Employee Participation\n\no    68.85      Hot Work Permit\n\no    68.87     Contractors\n\nBy implementing these 12 required sections found in Appendix A 40 CFR 68 Subpart D our facility can help prevented accidental releases through well-maintained equipment and well-trained personnel.  Plant personnel receives annual ammonia training. The plant's process safety management program, an OSHA regulation, pertains to ammonia directly and has been an important safeguard in the safe operation and emergency preparedness of the plant. \n\nThe plant is required to report any ammonia spills exceeding 100 lbs., the Reportable Quantity (RQ) for ammonia. These reports are made to the Federal, State, and County regulatory agencies. Notwithstanding the safety consequences of an ammonia release, it may be noted "

      "SummaryText": "that anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used agricultural fertilizer in the surrounding region where amounts much greater than the RQ are routinely applied directly to the soil.\n\nAdditionally, the plant submits an annual \"Tier II\" report to the State Emergency Response Commission, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Gaines County as well as two local fire departments. The TIER II report lists all hazardous chemicals, including anhydrous ammonia, that may be held above the threshold quantity at the plant. The report also describes the chemical properties and location of each chemical in the plant to assist emergency responders should they ever be called to the facility. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental release with offsite consequences, as defined in Appendix A 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1), at the facility within the past five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  The Cedar Lake Facility Emergency Response Program is built around the element found in Appendix A 40 CFR 68.95. The Cedar Lake Plant is prepared to respond to an emergency with ammonia. The facility has a Safety Manager on staff. Its emergency response team consists of plant personnel who are knowledgeable of the plant's process. They are trained in emergency response and conduct drills four times a year. They have the emergency gear necessary to enter an ammonia environment for rescue.In the event of a release, the response team is equipped to enter a dangerous area to close shutoff valves or take other measures to isolate the leak, thereby mitigating the release. They are also available and trained to assist the emergency responders in containing the release as quickly as possible. \n\nA disaster drill is held annually incorporated with the Gaines County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), Sheriff's Dept., the local fire department, and EMS units. This has proven to be very beneficial in coordinating the plant's response procedures with the local emergency planning a"
