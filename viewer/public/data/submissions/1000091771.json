      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION:  Cooper Natural Resources and its predecessor companies have produced the industrial mineral, sodium sulfate, from underground brine deposits in west Texas since 1933. Their Cedar Lake Plant, located in northeastern Gaines County, has been in operation since 1965. The sodium sulfate produced by the plant is a high purity, non-hazardous salt that is shipped to customers throughout the United States for use in the detergent, glass, paper, dyestuffs, and animal husbandry industries. The plant is supplied by shallow wells located in the adjacent, highly saline, Cedar Lake. The produced brine is over nine times the salinity of seawater. This brine is conveyed to the plant by pipelines. Refrigeration Units in the plant are then used to cool the brine and cause the precipitation of the hydrous form of sodium sulfate, Glauber's salt, Na2SO4X10H2O. The Refrigeration system contains approximately 69,500 lbs. of ammonia. The hydrous salt produced by refrigeration is then recovered by filtration and sent to the drying plant where a vapor recompression unit melts the salt in its waters of hydration. The concentration of the saturated solution results in the precipitation of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the marketable product. The anhydrous sodium sulfate is subsequently recovered by centrifuges and dried prior to shipment. No reagents or reactive chemistries are used in the process. The method of operation is based on simple phase chemistry alone. The plant produces high purity sodium sulfate salt ultra-pure steam condensate. \n\n\n\nPROGRAM STATUS: Program Status\n\nAs more fully described herein, the plant meets the eligibility requirements of Program 3 status as provided in Appendix A 40 CFR 68.10(d) of the RMP Rule because it meets all the following requirements.\n\n(1) The facility process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n(2) The distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint for a worst-c"

They have the emergency gear necessary to enter an ammonia environment for rescue.In the event of a release, the response team is equipped to enter a dangerous area to close shutoff valves or take other measures to isolate the leak, thereby mitigating the release.
