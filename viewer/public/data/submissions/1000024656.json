An employee was chipping ice off of the evaporator and accidentally hit a small pipe causing the line to rupture and spray vapor on the left side of his face and his eyes.  The employee was taken to the hospital for treatment.  The Long Beach Fire Department was notified.  All employees were quarantined from the leak.  Once safe, the facility called the refrigeration contractor, Mericle Mechanical, to weld the ruptured hole on the pipe.  The Long Beach Health Department was also onsite to monitor the situation.  After the leak was stopped, the Heath Department representative declared the room safe enough to enter.  Once the ammonia threshold was low enough for safe entrance, employees were allowed back into the facility.  The Long Beach Fire Department and the Hazmat Team were on site for approximately six and a half hours.  The Long Beach Health Department representative came back the next day and declared that it was safe for employees to return to work.\r\n\r\nJune 2009 Incident:\r\nAt 11:30 PM on June 17, 2009, the Operations Manager smelled ammonia in his office.  The Operations Manager reported this to the President and both performed a walk through of the facility to investigate where the ammonia smell was coming from.  They identified that the smell was from the Engine Room.  The Long Beach Fire Department was called and arrived on scene.  The facility also alerted the Chief Engineer and the Maintenance Manager who arrived on site shortly after.  The Hazmat Team also arrived and the building was shut off.  All streets surrounding the facility were closed off from public access.  The Hazmat Team shut off the King valve to stop all liquid supply to the Plant.  The Chief Engineer was then allowed to enter the building to assist the Hazmat team with the investigation.  They then identified that the ammonia leak was"

The refrigeration contractor, TDI Refrigeration, assisted the Chief Engineer to remove the \u00bc pipe cap and replaced it with a 3/8 pipe plug and stopped the leak.  Once the ammonia threshold reached a nonexistent level, the Health Department declared the building and surrounding property safe, and operations resumed as usual.  TDI Refrigeration and the Chief Engineer returned the next day for a follow up.  It is estimated that approximately 80 pounds of ammonia was released.  The Facility Manager met with the City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services as well as an OSHA representative on June 18, 2009 to complete the necessary follow-up and address inquiries on incident.  The president completed a written report to the National Response Center and the California Office of Emergency Services. \r\n\r\nJuly 2009 Incident:\r\nAt 3:20 PM on July 4, 2009, an ammonia leak reoccurred on Compressor #12.  The Long Beach Fire Department was called onsite.  They blocked off the streets and a perimeter was set up.  The Long Beach Fire Department estimated 20 pounds of ammonia was released.

The Human Resource & Facility Manager and the Maintenance Operator assisted the Long Beach Fire Department to find the source of the leak.  The Maintenance Operator shut down the system.  Once the ammonia concentration dropped to a non-detectable level, at approximately 8:00 PM, the fire department reported the building to be safe for re-entry and work. An incident investigation report was prepared.  The incident was reported to the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services and the Long Beach Fire Prevention Bureau.  The Vice President then contacted the State of California Office of Emergency Services and filed a report on the ammonia release incident.  \r\n\r\nThe Chief Engineer determined that the Compressor #11 shut down causing a high pressure on the Low Stage Compressors #1 and #14.  Compressor #1 shut off when the high pressure cutoff setting was reached.  The high pressure cutout for Compressor #14 was set too high, and the pressure switch did not shut off the compressor.  This caused the pressure to be higher than normal.  As a result, approximately 10 pounds of ammonia was released through Compressor #12.  There were no injuries that resulted from this incident.  As a resolution, the seal on Compressor #12 was tightened to reduce pressure in the system and to stop ammonia from leaking.  The Chief Engineer recommended to lower the pressure cutoff setting on Compressor #14 to 45 psig to prevent high pressure buildup when it is running and to shut down for any abnormal condition.  The Mycom technician was called to assess Compressor #11 and assure it is safe for use.  \r\n \r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.

The High Pressure Receiver HPR feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the two Intercoolers VI1 and VI2 and the -40F Recirculator (HR3).  It also feeds liquid ammonia (liquid injection) to Booster Compressor BC1 and Compressors MC-2 and MC-11 for oil cooling.  It receives liquid transferred from the Liquid Transfer Vessel TR1.  \r\n\r\nThe Intercoolers VI1 & VI2 receive booster discharge from the Booster Compressors BC1 and FC-5.  The liquid makeup of the Intercoolers VI1 and VI2 through the High Pressure Receiver HPR1 is controlled by two float switches where one opens the solenoid valve and the other closes the solenoid valve.  The valve remains open until the liquid level in the Intercoolers VI1 & VI2 is satisfied.  The liquid flows through a hand expansion valve to reduce the pressure of the incoming liquid.  High pressure liquid is also routed through a coil that sits inside each Intercooler in a bath of liquid ammonia.  The liquid is thereby sub-cooled (such that the temperature is lower than the corresponding saturation pressure) and routed to the +20oF Recirculator HR2, -20F Recirculator VR1, and Surge Drums SD1, SD2, SD3, and SD4.   The resulting medium temperature vapor in the vessel rises to the top and is pulled off by Compressors YC-15 and MC-2.\r\n\r\nThe -40F Recirculator HR3 receives high pressure liquid from the High Pressure Receiver HPR1.

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, Long Beach Cold Storage & Logistics operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, CalOSHA PSM Program, and EPA RMP Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization.\r\n\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history over the past five years (August 2006 to August 2011) revealed that there have been four ammonia releases that meet the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.
