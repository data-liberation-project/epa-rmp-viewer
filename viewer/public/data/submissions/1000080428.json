(Arch) facility is committed to operating and maintaining its processes in a safe and responsible manner which is accomplished by a combination of employee training, accidental release prevention programs, and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public along with the environment. This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Arch has designed and implemented and includes:\n\n \n\nA brief description of the facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA Risk Management regulation.\n\n?    An overview of the worst case release and alternate case release scenarios required by the rule.\n\n?    An overview of the site's accidental release prevention programs.\n\n?

An overview of planned improvements at the facility to minimize the number and severity of release incidents.\n\n?    Certification of the executive summary and risk management plan.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Arch Rochester facility produces biocides, personal care intermediates, and specialty chemical products. The biocide products are ingredients in anti-dandruff shampoos, marine and anti-fouling paints, coatings, etc. They are also used to prevent formation of mold and mildew in wall board.\n\nPersonal care intermediate products are utilized in various lotions and creams. Specialty chemical products are used in pharmaceutical, paint, coatings, and other products. The Arch Rochester facility has been in operation since 1950, and it operates 24 hours per day seven days per week 365 days per year. The facility is ISO 9000 and SOCMA certified.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe EPA Risk Management regulation requires that each facility subject to the rule provide a worst case release scenario for toxic and flammable chemicals and an alternate release scena"

Chlorine is used as a raw material and is received in 90 ton railcars. The maximum inventory of chlorine on site would be approximately 1,260,000 pounds.\n\nArch does not handle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals.\n\n\n\nFollowing are the worst case and alternate release scenarios for chlorine at the Arch Rochester facility and were developed using the Five-year Accident History and a review of the Process Hazard Analysis.  Human and environmental receptors that could be potentially impacted by the worst case and alternate release scenarios were identified using United States Census data, New York State Geographical Information Services Maps, and US Geologic Services Maps.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE\n\n\n\nAs required by the EPA Risk Management regulation, the worst case is presumed to be a release from the largest vessel or container. For this site, the largest vessel is the railcar that the chlorine is received in. Thus, using the assumptions required by the rule, the worst case release would be\n\n180,000 pounds of chlorine released to air in a 10 minute period with a wind speed of 1.5m/sec.\n\n\n\nALTERNATE RELEASE\n\n\n\nThe alternate release of chlorine assumes a leak and subsequent vaporization of chlorine from the\n\n2-chloropyridine manufacturing process. Therefore, the alternate release would be the entire contents of the chlorine process piping system released due to a piping or gasket failure. This incident would result in a release of approximately 667 pounds of chlorine (calculated from using the assumption of 83.4 lb/minute) and using the assumption that it would take eight minutes for the operator to be alerted by the chlorine monitor system and to shut off the emergency shut off valve on the chlorine railcar which is a reasonable estimate of human response time.  \n\n\n\nArch has implemented many safety layers to ensure that such a"
