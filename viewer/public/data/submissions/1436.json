If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Bancroft Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a farmer owned cooperative.  We sell agriculural products to members and non-members.  We sell NH3 for the sole purpose of fertilization of farm ground.  This facility consists of one 12,000 gallon tank and one 18,000 gallon tank which are plumbed together.\n\nOur worst-case senario would be the sudden release of both tanks at one time when they were filled to capacity.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to endpoint would be 4.4 miles with an approximate population of 705 people.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or enviromental damage, or evacuations.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our NH3 plant, it is our policy to notify the Bancroft Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our NH3 facility.\n\nThere are no planned changes of our proceedures or policies."
