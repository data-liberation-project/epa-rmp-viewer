A combination of accidental release prevention and emergency action planning will be used to protect the environment and to ensure the safety of the employees as well as the citizens of the surrounding communities.\n\n\n\nThis Executive Summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Synergy Liquids will implement, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of the facility and the substances regulated by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 that are currently handled on-site in stationary sources above their corresponding threshold quantities;\n\n- An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\n- A five-year accident history for significant accidental releases from processes covered by EPA's RMP rule;\n\n- An overview of the emergency response programs; and\n\n- An overview of improvements at the facility implemented to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting the employees, the public, the environment, and company assets.\n\n\n\n1.2 ?68.155(b): Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nSynergy Liquids has executed an agreement to utilize the existing rail spur at the Three Rivers Oilfield Service Center located at 3077 S.

Synergy Liquids has developed a written procedure that lists the conditions and guidelines for safely transloading LPG and Propane HD-5 from a rail car to a tank truck or vice versa.  This procedure is followed by the third-party carrier who actually performs the transloading on behalf of Synergy Liquids.  \n\n\n\nBoth LPG and Propane HD-5 are liquefied flammable gases transported under pressure.
