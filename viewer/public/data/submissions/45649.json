      "SummaryText": "Pandol and Sons Cold Storage located at 401 Road 192, Delano, California 93215 is a cooling facility for fruits and vegetables. It has approximately 60,000 square feet of refrigerated storage space. Ammonia in the amount of 36,002 pounds is the refrigerant used in this facility and is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The primary activities are the receiving, cooling, storage, and shipping of fruits and vegetables. All employees working in areas where ammonia is used receive a General Awareness training program upon employment and at least annually there after. The General Awareness program includes characteristics of ammonia, evacuation routes and procedures, and familiarization with the Pandol and Sons Emergency Response Plan and Emergency Responders. The general philosophy of Pandol and Sons is not to expose employees to hazardous levels of hazardous materials in any emergency response activities. As outlined in this policy, all employees will be trained to evacuate areas of possible exposure.  Pandol and Sons has tried to minimize the possibility of accidental releases by placing as much of the ammonia system out of everyday work areas as possible. All ammonia piping other than coils are on the roof and away from traffic areas. Outdated compressors have been replaced with newer and more technically advanced machines. We have annual inspections of all cooling coils and replace as deemed necessary by our refrigeration contractor. There is a computer control and monitoring system that runs the facility.  Pandol and Sons is proud that we have had no accidental releases in the last five years and through our training programs, safety programs and inspection programs we feel confident that we will continue without an accidental release in the years to come."
