      "SummaryText": "Berend Bros. Inc.  Windthorst Tx. 76389\n\n1. Facility Policy - The owner, manager and employees of Berend Bros. Inc. are committed to the prevention of any releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If a release should occur, we are prepared to work with local fire department, medical agencies and law enforcement to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and sold to farmers as a fertilizer.  The maximum quantity stored at our location at any one time would be 75,000. lbs. in three storage tanks.  The maximum quantity handled at any time would be the unloading of a tanker truck, in the amount of 37,500lbs. \n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario - The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of one storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 30,000 lbs.  The distance to end point would be 2.0 miles.  The alternative scenario based on the most likley potential release is a release from a pipe leak.  The quantity released would be 500 lbs. in a 2 minute period.  The distace to end point is.1 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program - The facility has excess flow valves, relief valves.  and manual shutoff valves to help prevent accidental releases.  We have also implemented the provisions of OSHA 29 CFR1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  The facility also has training and safety meetings on a regular basis.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program - The facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA 29CFR 1910.38.  We have also provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III.  We have a written emergency response program in accordance with OSHA standard"
