      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention Policy:\n\nThe most common tine for an accidental chlorine release is during cylinder change out procedure.  Under District policy, this is  allowed only with the properly trained personnel, proper self contained air packs and back-up operators to assist if a leak occurs.  After the change is complete, all connections are checked for leaks with ammonia.\n\nEmergency Response Policy:\n\nIn case of a chemical release, the operator is notified by a chlorine gas detector and auto dial telephone system.  It is the Districts policy to notify the Highlands Fire Department which is the first responder.  The Fire Department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System.\n\nStationary Source:\n\nThe stationary source of a posible chemical release is the Wasrewater Treatment Plant at 611 Avenue E, Highlands Texas 77562.  The chemical stored and used above the EPA Threshold at this location is chlorine gas.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenatio:\n\nThe release of chlorine gas at a rate of 200 pounds per minute from a ruptured one ton cylinder would affect an area with a radius of 1.3 miles according to Exhibit 4-3, page 4-7 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nThese cylinders are rotated on a regular basis at which time they are returned to the chemical supplier for inspection and refill.\n\nAlternative Scenario:\n\nA release of chlorine at a rate of 37 pounds per minute from a broken 1/2 inch vapor feed line would affect an area with a radius of 0.1 mile according to Exhibit 4-15, page 4-26 of the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nThe 1/2 inch feed lines are attached to the chlorine cylinders with a vaccum regulator which shuts down the chlorine flow if a leak occrs in the feed line and vaccum is lost.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nIt is the policy of Harris County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 to maintain all chemical feeding equipm"

Annual preventive maintenance of chemical feeders by outside chlorinator maintenance professionals ensure proper operation.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has not experienced a offsite accident in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn case of a chlorine release, the procedure is to notify the fire department by phone as to wind direction, type of leak and size of leak.  The fire department evaluates the situation and notifies the public through the LEPC's One Call System.\n\nSafety:\n\nThe District remains committed to maintaining it's safety record and will continue the equipment maintenance and inspection as well as continued education for it's employees.  The District personnel attends safety classes taught throughTexas A&M Extension Service.  There are also monthly safety meetings at which chlorine safety is one of many topics discussed."
