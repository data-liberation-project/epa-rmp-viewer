Enel believes that no monetary value can be placed above a human life and therefore will provide procedures for the primary purpose of preserving life and secondly to preserve its assets at this location. \n\n\n\nEnel expects its employees to respond only to incidental releases of hazardous substances and not to major, uncontrollable releases where employees are expected to immediately evacuate the site. Therefore, an Emergency Action Plan, which is an element of the Emergency Response Plan, has been developed to detail the evacuation procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Stillwater Geothermal Power Plant is a binary geothermal power generation facility built on a combination of Enel owned property, private leases, and Bureau of Land Management leases within the Stillwater Known Geothermal Resource Area (KGRA). The project is designed to produce approximately 47.2 MW gross output (Unit Nameplate Gross Capacity 11.8 MW x 4). \n\n\n\nA binary geothermal plant operates utilizing two closed loop systems that exchange heat energy. The first loop is geothermal fluid that is pumped from production wells to the plant. This hot geothermal brine passes through a heat exchanger where a portion of its heat energy is given up and then flows to injection wells where it is pumped back into the underground resource. The second loop is the working fluid, in this case isobutane, which is pumped from an accumulator vessel, as a liquid, to the heat exchangers where heat from the geothermal fluid vaporizes the isobutane to a superheated vapor. In the vapor state it passes through a turbine which in turn drives a generator that produces electrical energy. Having passed through the turbine, the vapor, at reduced temperature and press"

The liquid isobutane gravity drains back to the accumulator vessel from which it will begin the cycle again.  During normal operation the isobutane and geothermal fluid are never in direct contact and there are no losses to the atmosphere.    \n\n\n\nEnel complies with all requirements of Nevada's Department of Environmental Protection Chemical Accident Prevention Program (\"CAPP\"). Additionally the CAPP program contains all of the elements of OSHA's PSM Standard 29 CFR, Part 1910.199(c) and EPA RMP Standard 40 CFR, Part 68.83. Program elements of CAPP are administered by Enel's HSEQ Specialist with the site Operations Supervisor being responsible for the day to day implementation. Employee's are aware of, have access to and are included in the development and implementation of all of the following program elements: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Standard Operating Procedures and Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Pre Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, Emergency Action/Response Plan, Contractor Safety Training, Preventative Maintenance/Mechanical Integrity, Employee Participation and Verification of Compliance Audit programs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnel also has incorporated safety systems into the design of the Stillwater Geothermal Plant that enhance the overall safety of the operation. Specific measures include an Emergency Shutdown System to bring all plant processes to a halt in a timely manor, Combustible Gas and Fire Detectors, Fire Water System, Standby Generator System, Audible and Visual Alarms and Ventilation Systems designed to react to an emergency, Additionally an evacuation system prevents emissions of isobutane to surroundings prior to maintenance. \n\n\n\nEnel has had no accidental releases of isobutane since startup June 2010 and with careful implementation of its safety program elements, in addition t"
