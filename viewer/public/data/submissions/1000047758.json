      "SummaryText": "Air Products LLC (Baytown)\r\n\r\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\n\r\nAt this facility, we produce gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the Rectisol Syngas Separation Unit and Shift/ROG Unit.  Flammable gases containing hydrogen and propylene are present in the process in concentrations and amounts which cause the process to be covered by the EPA RMP regulation.  \r\n\r\nIt is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\r\n\r\nOur emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Baytown Local Emergency Planning Commission so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the covered process located at this facility is the production and purification of gaseous hydrogen and gaseous carbon monoxide.  These gases are used by our customers to manufacture other chemicals.\r\n\r\nA gaseous mixture is received by our plant via an aboveground pipeline from a neighboring oil refinery gasifier.  This gas already contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide, bu"

      "SummaryText": "t the hydrogen and carbon monoxide are mixed with methane, ethane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and other impurities.  The gas is subjected to a series of steps to remove some of the impurities.  The hydrogen and carbon monoxide are then separated from each other and from the remaining methane impurity in a cold box, which purifies the products by cryogenic distillation.  The product gases are compressed and delivered to customers via our underground pipeline network.  \r\n\r\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year accident history:\r\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n \r\n\r\n5.  The emergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon the OSHA HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA First Responder Awareness (FRA)Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities are also coordinated with Exxon Mobil.  In addition, periodic drills are conducted on site to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  \r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nThe facility resolves recommendations from Process Hazards Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
