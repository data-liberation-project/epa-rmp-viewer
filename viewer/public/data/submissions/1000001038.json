This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TETRAA?s processes.  TETRA's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n2.0  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    TETRA is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas.  TETRA produces zinc bromide, calcium bromide, and sodium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry.\nTETRA was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, TETRA personnel identified no listed flammable substances and one toxic regulated substance kept on site.  One regulated toxic substance was identified, bromine, with 166,528 lb as the largest quantity on site.  This exceeds the RMP Rule threshold quantity for bromine of 10,000 lb.  \n\n3.0  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM\n    \nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at TETRA.  The processes at TETRA that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\n    Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process tech"

The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge of training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n    TETRA keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n    Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n    TETRA also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n    TETRA has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n    TETRA primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, TETRA will use other inductive techniques such as what-if/checklist analysis and"

PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project, plant manager or knowledgeable plant person, a person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis, and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n    To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\n\n1)    age of process,\n2)    extent of process hazards,\n3)    number of affected employees, and\n4)    operating history of the process.\n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n3.3  Operating Procedures\n\n    TETRA maintains written procedures that address various modes of "

The review is to ensure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in completing the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n3.4  Training\n\n    In addition to training on operating procedures, TETRA has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations and procedures.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  The appropriate frequency of training is determined by management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training "

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n    The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  Prior to startup, TETRA determines that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations are resolved, and training of employees involved in the process is completed as part of the PSSR.\n\n3.8  Compliance Audits\n\n    To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, TETRA periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at least one person knowledgeable in the audit techniques.  The audit team develops findings in a report that is forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retai"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor), and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of the incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, these results are forwarded to the business management team for resolution.\n\n3.10  Employee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of TETRAA?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communication is encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\nTETRA strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include a plant health, safety, and environment leadership team, regularly scheduled safety meetings, hazard communication, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special tr"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n \n\n3.11  Safe Work Practices (Hot Work Permits, etc.)\n\n    Several actions are incorporated during construction of new processes or equipment to ensure the activities are suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are performed to ensure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions are suitable for the particular application.  TETRA has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:\n\n1)    control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel,\n2)    lockout/tag out procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance,\n3)    procedures for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened,\n4)    permits and procedures to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and\n5)    permits and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.\n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n3.12  Contractors\n\n    TETRA uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
