The facility's Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (Plan) was developed and designed to:\r\n\r\n1.) Save lives.\r\n2.) Minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) Protect the environment.\r\n4.) Minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes,\r\nchemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed at least once per year and updated as needed.\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains an emergency response team. Each member receives refresher training and re-qualification annually. Equipment necessary to quickly respond to an incident is kept at the facility, including monitors and an emergency scrubber. The Longmont Fire Department is invited to walk-through's and drills to acquaint the staff with the facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following (\u00a768.42(a)) and any release that meets the criteria below must be reported in the RMP:\r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its\r\nthreshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\na) On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\r\nb) Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nMatheson has had no releases of hydrogen fluoride over the past five years that meet the criteria specified above.

As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of hydrogen fluoride. Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of the hydrogen fluoride process, as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the process. The company training policy requires all employees to properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\r\n\r\nMatheson senior management is committed to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Matheson's safety and environmental policies are administered by the Site Manager with the assistance of the Plant Manager, Maintenance Manager, and Corporate Environmental Compliance. Periodic inspections of the facility are conducted to ensure compliance and to oversee the entire safety and environmental programs. These programs include various safety procedures and policies, the Emergency Response and Contingency Plan, and the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility is located at 1861 Lefthand Circle in Longmont, Colorado.

The HF process involves two cylinders stored together in the process area dedicated to HF operations. Each HF cylinder has a capacity of 1,330 pounds. At any given time, one cylinder will be utilized in the manufacturing process, while the second cylinder is stored until the first cylinder is emptied during manufacturing.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is\r\ninherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the HF process. For example, the facility implements several safety programs in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\n\r\nCompressed gas cylinders are manufactured and maintained to the exact codes and standards\r\nspecified by DOT, NFPA, and CGA. Cylinder construction is mandated in all aspects including\r\nmetallurgy, wall thickness, and design pressure. These codes and standards have been established to insure that compresses gas cylinders are designed to withstand extremes of operation and overpressure conditions. Each cylinder must be tested and re-qualified every 5 years. Valves must meet stringent manufacturing standards as well. In addition to these codes and standards, Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has internal policies for handling compressed gas cylinders. Compliance with these standards, codes, and policies significantly reduces the likelihood of a catastrophic failure of a compressed gas cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a primary element of this facility's release prevention program is experienced operators. Not only are they certified with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform their duties safely, they are able to assess and resolve possible abnormalities before they result in a release. Operators are present at the facility 24 hours a day, five days a week.\r\n\r\nCylinders"

The facility plans to convert the media used to facilitate condenser cooling from dry ice to either carbon dioxide or liquid nitrogen.\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. management is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plans/programs.\r\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\r\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
