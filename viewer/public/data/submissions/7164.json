              "Description": "PREVENTION PROGRAM -- CHLORINE DIOXIDE\nStone Container Corporation, Panama City has a OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place covering its chlorine dioxide operations. This PSM program meets the requirements of the RMP and is thus utilized as the prevention section of the Panama City facility's RMP. The PSM program was audited in July 1998 and the program was found to be effective and being practiced. There were several items that needed some correction such as documentation of maintenance training. This has been addressed.\n\nA process hazard analysis for the chlorine dioxide system was conducted and all items that were identified as a concern have been addressed.\n\nThe mill maintains current copies of the MSDS for all operating and maintenance employees to use in determining the required safety action they need to take in working with chlorine dioxide. These MSDS's are posted on the mill computer network and in written form in a central location.\n\nThere are up-to-date operating procedures that relate to the chlorine dioxide system. These procedures address the hazards of chlorine dioxide and how to safely complete the required task. Specific subjects that are addressed are:     Initial startup,     Normal operations,     Temporary operations,     Emergency shutdown and operations,     Startup after an emergency shutdown,     Normal shutdown,     Startup after a normal shutdown,     Startup after a change to the system that required a hazard review,     Consequence of a deviation and steps to correct or avoid the deviation,     Equipment inspections  All employees that work with or maintain the chlorine dioxide process and equipment have been trained in the correct procedures for their area of activity. Refresher training is conducted as often as necessary to insure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures. The refresher training will include safety and the hazards of chlorine dioxide and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.\n\nWritten procedures are maintained for insuring the ongoing maintenance, inspections and checking of the integrity of the chlorine dioxide system equipment. There is a training program for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of the chlorine dioxide system equipment to insure that each employee can do the job in a safe manner. P.M. inspections are conducted using the Panama City's maintenance department's programs, forms and procedures.\n\nAny incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine dioxide will be investigated. All employees are required to report all chlorine dioxide related incidents and document the incident using the mill Form. This form as related to a release of chlorine dioxide and its use will be a part of the safety training each employee involved in operation and maintenance of the chlorine dioxide system will receive.  An incident investigation team approach is used to investigate any reported release.The facility procedures establish that prompt addressing and resolving the incident investigation teams findings and recommendations is required.\n\nContractors are defined for the purpose of this RMP as \"Anyone performing maintenance, repairs, turnarounds, major renovations or specialty work on or adjacent to the chlorine dioxide process\". All contractors that work on any part of the covered chlorine dioxide process will have to provide evidence that their employees understand their responsibility and are trained in correct operating and maintenance procedures as well as the specific safety requirements of working with chlorine dioxide.\n\nThis plan has been developed with the help of our employees. Details are covered in the PSM documentation.",

There were several items that needed some correction such as documentation of maintenance training. This has been addresed.\n\nA process hazard analysis for the chlorine system was conducted and all items that were identified as a concern have been addressed.\n \nThe mill maintains current copies of the MSDS for all operating and maintenance employees to use in determining the required safety action they need to take in working with chlorine. These MSDS's are posted on the mill computer network and in written form in a central location.\n  \nThere are up-to-date operating procedures that relate to the chlorine system. These procedures address the hazards of chlorine and how to safely complete the required task. Specific subjects that are addressed are:     Initial startup,     Normal operations,     Temporary operations,     Emergency shutdown and operations,     Startup after an emergency shutdown,     Normal shutdown,     Startup after a normal shutdown,     Startup after a change to the system that required a hazard review,     Consequence of a deviation and steps to correct or avoid the deviation,     Equipment inspections  All employees that work with or maintain the chlorine dioxide process and equipment have been trained in the correct procedures for their area of activity. Refresher training is conducted as often as necessary to insure employees are operating or maintaining the system according to current procedures and are adhering to the current procedures. The refresher training will include safety and the hazards of chlorine dioxide and avoidance of unsafe conditions.  Refresher training will be provided at least every three years.  Written procedures are maintained for insuring the ongoing maintenance, inspections and checking of the integrity of the chlorine system equipment. There is a training program for each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of the chlorine system equipment to insure that each employee can do the job in a safe manner. P.M. inspections are conducted using the Panama City's maintenance department's programs, forms and procedures.   \n\nAny incident that did or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine will be investigated. All employees are required to report all chlorine related incidents and document the incident using the mill Form. This form as related to a release of chlorine and its use will be a part of the safety training each employee involved in operation and maintenance of the chlorine  system will receive.  An incident investigation team approach is used to investigate any reported release.The facility procedures establish that prompt addressing and resolving the incident investigation teams findings and recommendations is required.\n\nContractors are defined for the purpose of this RMP as \"Anyone performing maintenance, repairs, turnarounds, major renovations or specialty work on or adjacent to the chlorine dioxide process\". All contractors that work on any part of the covered chlorine  process will have to provide evidence that their employees understand their responsibility and are trained in correct operating and maintenance procedures as well as the specific safety requirements of working with chlorine.   \n\nThis plan has been developed with the help of our employees.

This manual gives the detail requirement that must be taken by each facility to develop its safety program. The manual describes senior management's commitment to safety. The safety policy assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for conducting an effective safety program.\nThere is a written Corporate CHEMICAL HAZARD COMMUNICATION MANUAL. The manual describes how each facility is to develop its own local Hazard Communication program. The manual assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for developing an effective Hazard Communication program.\n\nPanama City Mill Policy\nIt is the policy of Stone Container Corporation, Panama City, Florida to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine or chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be minnnimized. To accomplish this the chlorine valves, regulators, heaters, vaporizers, controllers, lines, connections, fittings, injectors and the chlorine dioxide generator, storage tanks, pipe lines, mixers and pumps are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices.  Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and the chlorine dioxide systems have been trained in the requirements of chlorine and chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nDescription of Panama City operation\nStone Container Corporation's Panama City facility produces kraft linerboard and bleached hardwood Market Pulp. In the process of bleaching pulp both chlorine and chlorine dioxide are utilized. Process water is treated with chlorine to prevent a slime buildup in the production process.  \n\nDescription of RMP processes\nChlorine - Bleach plant \nChlorine is delivered to the mill in 90 tons rail cars that are used as the on site storage container.

Chlorine vapors are metered into the process as needed.\nChlorine - Water treatment\nThere are two locations on the mill site where chlorine is used to treat process water. The two systems are identical other than location. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders. There are two cylinders connected at each location. Chlorine vapors pass through an in line electric heater, a regulator and vacuum shutoff valve, a flow meter, a flow control valve, a water driven vacuum inductor and is injected into the process water line.  \nChlorine Dioxide\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site in a process using sodium chlorate and methanol in a strong sulfuric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide is removed, as generated, by vacuum and absorbed in cold water (38-40 :F) to a concentration of 9 to 10 grams / liter. There are two storage tanks for the chlorine dioxide solution. Each tank has a capacity of 53,800 gallons. This solution is used at two locations in the bleach plant operations. The total usage is about 190 to 210 gpm\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nChlorine Dioxide\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine dioxide that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 53,800 gallons of solution containing 4478 pounds of chlorine dioxide. There are two of these tanks which are located in an area that serves to contain the release. This contained area has an exposed surface area of 7292 square feet. This will result in a worst-case release scenario quantity of 115.2 pounds per minute of chlorine dioxide\nThere are administrative controls on chlorine dioxide inventory at the facility. The chlorine dioxide tanks are 24 feet tall. There are operating instructions that restrict the operating level to only 17 feet. This allows room for holding the surge volume required when the bleach plant shut down quickly. The depths of solution will never reaches a level of over 19 feet. This level is recorded on the lo"

These two tanks are located in a low area bound by a railroad track (dike), other containment areas and roadways. The volume of this contained area is more than needed to contain one tank. The surface area will be restricted to 7292 square feet. \nThe second passive control is the drain from the contained area. This drain coupled with the excess volume in the contained area will prevent any release of the material in the other tank from spreading to an area larger than 7292 square feet. This drain will carry the released chlorine dioxide solution in a closed sewer to be mixed with other process sewer water and the chlorine dioxide will react and be diluted. \n\nChlorine - Bleach plant\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 180,000 pounds. This will be only one rail tank car connected and operating at a time. Under the restrictions of the worst-case scenario this tank car will fail and will release its entire content.

The line breaks releasing this flow of a 10 gram per liter solution. On rupture there will be a loss of pressure notifying the bleach plant control room operator that something has happened. It was estimated that it would require no more than 15 minutes to locate the problem and to stop and valve out the pump. This release will involve a total of 3000 gallons or 249.8 pounds for a release rate of 16.6 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint will be 1,621 yards.\nThe release rate assumption for this alternative release scenarios is that 100% of  the Chlorine Dioxide in the released solution is released to the air as soon as it reaches the ground. \nChlorine - Bleach Plant\nThere is a failure of the tank car relief valve. It was assumed that the release rate would be just below the 15,000 pound per hour excess flow valve. This would result in a release rate of 250 pounds per minute. As this would trip the alarm and cause an upset in the process the time to control would be about 45 minutes for the mill Emergency Response Team to respond and close the valve. The distance to the endpoint will be 2.1 miles.\nChlorine - water treatment \nA tank is in service with the regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder.
