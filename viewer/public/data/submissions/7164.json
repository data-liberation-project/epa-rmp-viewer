The line breaks releasing this flow of a 10 gram per liter solution. On rupture there will be a loss of pressure notifying the bleach plant control room operator that something has happened. It was estimated that it would require no more than 15 minutes to locate the problem and to stop and valve out the pump. This release will involve a total of 3000 gallons or 249.8 pounds for a release rate of 16.6 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint will be 1,621 yards.\nThe release rate assumption for this alternative release scenarios is that 100% of  the Chlorine Dioxide in the released solution is released to the air as soon as it reaches the ground. \nChlorine - Bleach Plant\nThere is a failure of the tank car relief valve. It was assumed that the release rate would be just below the 15,000 pound per hour excess flow valve. This would result in a release rate of 250 pounds per minute. As this would trip the alarm and cause an upset in the process the time to control would be about 45 minutes for the mill Emergency Response Team to respond and close the valve. The distance to the endpoint will be 2.1 miles.\nChlorine - water treatment \nA tank is in service with the regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder. The release rate will be 0.39 pounds per minute and the duration of the leak could be 3 to 4 hours until the next round by the operator.

The manual describes how each facility is to develop its own local Hazard Communication program. The manual assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for developing an effective Hazard Communication program.\n\nPanama City Mill Policy\nIt is the policy of Stone Container Corporation, Panama City, Florida to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine or chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be minnnimized. To accomplish this the chlorine valves, regulators, heaters, vaporizers, controllers, lines, connections, fittings, injectors and the chlorine dioxide generator, storage tanks, pipe lines, mixers and pumps are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices.  Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and the chlorine dioxide systems have been trained in the requirements of chlorine and chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nDescription of Panama City operation\nStone Container Corporation's Panama City facility produces kraft linerboard and bleached hardwood Market Pulp. In the process of bleaching pulp both chlorine and chlorine dioxide are utilized.

Chlorine vapors are metered into the process as needed.\nChlorine - Water treatment\nThere are two locations on the mill site where chlorine is used to treat process water. The two systems are identical other than location. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders. There are two cylinders connected at each location. Chlorine vapors pass through an in line electric heater, a regulator and vacuum shutoff valve, a flow meter, a flow control valve, a water driven vacuum inductor and is injected into the process water line.  \nChlorine Dioxide\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site in a process using sodium chlorate and methanol in a strong sulfuric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide is removed, as generated, by vacuum and absorbed in cold water (38-40 :F) to a concentration of 9 to 10 grams / liter. There are two storage tanks for the chlorine dioxide solution. Each tank has a capacity of 53,800 gallons. This solution is used at two locations in the bleach plant operations. The total usage is about 190 to 210 gpm\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nChlorine Dioxide\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine dioxide that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 53,800 gallons of solution containing 4478 pounds of chlorine dioxide.
