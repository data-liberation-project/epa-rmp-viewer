The resources invested in accident prevention such as the training of personnel and consideration of safety and prevention in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes demonstrate this commitment.  Our policy is to prevent releases of substances.   If a release does occur, Ferro-Hammond's trained personnel, supplemented by the Hammond Fire Department, Hammond Emergency Management Agency, and Lake County Emergency Planning Commission will respond, if needed, to control and contain the release.\n\n1.2 Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nFerro-Hammond manufactures and processes specialty chemicals in Hammond, Indiana.  Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks, and chemical manufacturing processes are in use at the site.  These are evaluated to determine the regulated flammable or toxic substances which exceed the threshold quantity as set forth in regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r).   \n\nThe site uses two regulated toxic substances in two different processes.

Using the EPA risk analysis format, the distances to endpoints [i.e., Emergency Response Planning Guideline level 2 (ERPG-2)] for chlorine and ethylenediamine exceed the distance to the nearest public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public).  Ferro-Hammond is regulated by to Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and operates within a listed Standard Industrial Code (2899). \n\n1.3 Off-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.3.1 Worst-Case Releases (EPA Required Format)\n\nRegulated Toxic Substances \n\nEndpoint distances for regulated toxic substances can be determined by the ERPG method.  Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A, 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints).  The two regulated substances at Ferro-Hammond were reviewed using the EPA look-up tables to determine which had the greatest distance to an endpoint.  Chlorine indicated the greatest distance, therefore this is the scenario being reported as the worst-case.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), involves the complete release, over a 10-minute period, of the largest amount of a regulated toxic substance from a process at the facility during weather conditions that would allow the release to have the greatest distance of impact.  Additionally, the EPA requires that these distances be calculated assuming that none of the active safety systems that could minimize the effects of the release would be used and that no emergency actions to stop or minimize the release would be taken.\n\nUnder these stringent and extremely unlikely conditions, the accident that would have an impact the farthest away from the Keil facility would result from the failure of a full railroad car of chlorine.

EPA requires that the selected alternative release scenarios for toxic substances be limited to those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility=s fence line.  The following conditions are considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\nRelease rate is dependent upon scenario;\nUse of typical meteorological conditions ;\nActual release height; \nConsideration of active mitigation systems; and\nPassive mitigation systems.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was developed for each regulated toxic substance.\n\nFor chlorine, the alternative-case scenario was caused by improper valve operation.  As a result of improperly aligning the valve, chlorine was sent to a caustic scrubber.  The large volume of chlorine caused a rapid depletion of the caustic scrubbing solution and therefore eliminated the mitigation capabilities causing 4,524 pounds of chlorine to be vented, unabated through the scrubber stack.  The release was discovered and stopped within 10 minutes due to emergency shutdown and back-up systems.  This type of release resulted in a 0.21-mile distance to the toxic endpoint.  \n\nFor ethylenediamine, the overfilling of a tank caused the alternative-case scenario.  The release is discovered and contained using active and passive mitigation systems.  Upon discovery, the transfer pumps were immediately shutdown and 2,082 gallons of ethylenediamine were contained within the diked-area.  Of the 2,082 gallons of spilled material 1,872 pounds of this was released within 5 minutes.  This release scenario resulted in a 0.05-mile distance to the toxic endpoint\n\n1.4 General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe site has an accidental rele"

In combination these activities form a systematic review of the mechanical integrity of each process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures provide assurance that work is performed in a consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to provide assurance that equipment can and will function as intended and to verify that equipment is maintained within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified it is corrected before placing the equipment back into service or temporary control measures are used to ensure safety is not compromised.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Ferro-Hammond incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper material and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n1.4.6 Management of Change\n\nFerro-Hammond has a comprehensive system to manage changes made to processes covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriate for safe startup and operation prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides additional checks to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n1.4.8 Compliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Ferro-Hammond periodically conducts an audit to determine the extent to which the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n1.4.9 Incident Investigation\n\nFerro-Hammond promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years.\n\n1.4.10 Employee Participation\n\nFerro-Hammond encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from analyzing, updating, and compiling process related technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have 24-hour access to information used in Ferro-Hammond=s accident prevention program. Protection and continuous improvement are the themes of the site's program.\n\nThe ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan maintained at the plant.  Specifically, teams are formed to promote process and personal safety. The teams are comprised of members from various units in the plant including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n1.4.11 Hot Work Permits\n\nFerro-Hammond has an array of work practices in place to safeguard worker and process safety.  One of these is a permit procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work). This procedure (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system that ensures operation and maintenance activities can be performed safely.\n\n1.4.12 Contractors\n\nFerro-Hammond uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This summary identifies each of the OSHA PSM and RMP elements and describes the management system in place to ensure accident prevention.\n\n1.4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nFerro-Hammond maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to assure safe operations. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific assignments are made to ensure there is responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Tables are made available to employees summarizing the reference documents and their locations.  This helps employees to easily locate and use process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and other documents.  For specific process areas, Ferro-Hammond has documented safety-related limits for critical process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition).  The process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant safety systems, trained personnel, continuous oversight, and/or protective instrument systems (e.g., shutdown systems).\n\n1.4.2 Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nFerro-Hammond has a comprehensive program to ensure  that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and evaluate the controls, including the need for redundancy.  The goal is to prevent accidents and releases.\n\nFerro-Hammond primarily relies on the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as"

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to on-site management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking as assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk potential receives immediate attention.  The PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed and the final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, Ferro-Hammond periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. \n\n1.4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nFerro-Hammond maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for the consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Ferro-Hammond has an array of work practices in place to safeguard worker and process saf"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, anb (4) a permit procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of personnel, form a system that ensures operation and maintenance activities can be performed safely.\n\n1.4.4 Training\n\nFerro-Hammond has a comprehensive training program for all employees. New employees in operations and maintenance receive basic training in plant operations or demonstrate that they already have those skills.  After successfully completing training a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own they can work more independently.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skill and knowledge is maintained at an acceptable level.  This training is documented separately for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nAll site employees attend monthly environmental, health, and safety meetings.  Each monthly meeting covers a different environmental, health, or safety topic.  Some of the topics covered in 1999 include spill kit hands-on training, personal protective equipment, and spill response drills.\n\n\n1.4.5 Mechanical Integrity\n\nFerro-Hammond has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

RMP reportable releases of ethylenediamine occurred in 1994 and 1995.  The largest of 20 pounds occurred in April 1995.  These releases are reportable because of their on-site affects, which resulted in OSHA recordable injuries of 3 employees. \n\nRMP reportable releases of chlorine occurred in 1997 and 1998, each release was approximately 1 pound.  These releases are reportable because of their on-site affects, which resulted in OSHA recordable injuries of 2 employees.\n\nEach release resulted in an incident investigation and corrective actions, if necessary.  Please see the appropriate section for additional information on how incident investigations help the Ferro-Hammond site to prevent future releases and to continuously improve our processes.\n\n\n1.7 Emergency Response Program Information\n\nFerro-Hammond maintains a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) which is followed to protect worker and public safety and the environment during an emergency.  The plan includes procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance.  The procedures address emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation, personnel accounting, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instruc"
