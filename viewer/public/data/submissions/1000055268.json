This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage System.  The facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers, including regulated substances:  Anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored at the site in an 18,000 gallon bullet tank.  The facility implements administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia to 82% of the bullet tank capacity. The total capacity stored onsite is 56,000 pounds; which is based on the number of gallons stored onsite (12,000 gallons) and the specific gravity of ammonia (0.682).\n\n \n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the facility is considered retail, since anhydrous ammonia from the facility is delivered directly to the farmer (end user), thus is required to follow the EPA RMP Program 2. However, the facility currently follows the CalARP Program 3 requirements for anhydrous ammonia as required by the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, the CalARP Participating Agency (PA) for the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA).\n\n\n\nHAZARD REVIEW \n\nThe 5-year Hazard Review Update was completed at the facility on 10/15/2014.  The findings and corrective actions that resulted in the Hazard Review Update have been incorporated into the Facilities Planned Changes to Improve Safety.  The completion on the corrective actions and safety improvements are tra"

The anhydrous ammonia worst-case scenario is a release of 56,000 pounds from the anhydrous ammonia bullet tank.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nBased on the EPA RMP guidance, the alternative-case release scenarios is defined as a release scenario that is more likely than the worst-case release scenario. The anhydrous ammonia alternative case scenario is a release during the transfer of ammonia from the bullet tank to a nurse tank. \n\n \n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalational hazard; and thus, the use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within the community. The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis, Hazard Assessment, and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility employs a safety specialist to coordinate training and implementation of the RMP.\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 3 (anhydrous ammonia), key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia.  Prevention elements for each program are listed below.\n\n- Process Safety Information (PSI) \n\n- Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n- Operating Procedures (OP)\n\n- Training (TRN)\n\n- Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\n- M"

A security guard completes visual inspections of the ammonia systems three times per night.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no CalARP-applicable releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n\n\n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of anhydrous ammonia were addressed by the PHA.\n\n\n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\n\nThe use of flammable materials at the Wilbur-Ellis Manteca Facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.
