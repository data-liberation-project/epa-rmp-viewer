The Plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employee's working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instructions.\n\nThe process at the natural gas fired electric generating plant subject to RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is a part of the Selective Catalytic Reduction system used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning natural gas.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Theodore Cogeneration Plant is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program at the Plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete and up to date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining  and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic compliance audits and incident investigations including the resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\nNo release has occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nThe Theodore Cogeneration Plant is included in the Mobile LEPC emergency r"
