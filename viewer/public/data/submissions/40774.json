We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training and inspecting process avalible.\n\nEmergency Response Policy(ERP).  The Authority will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public and the environment.  Trained on-site responders will access the emergency, and decide a course of action.  For emergencies within their training level they will respond.  For an emergency not included in their training, off site emergency response agencies will be called.\n\nThe Stationary Sourse.  The stationary sourse is the gaseous chlorine disinfection system at this municipal water treatment plant.  Chloine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is the regulated substance handled at this facility.  The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 32,000 pounds.  The quanity qualifies the chlorine system as a Program 3 process.\nThe Worst-case Scenario.  The worst-case scenario is the rupture of the largest chlorine tank.  The volume of the storage tank would allow the a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chlorine to be stored.  In the worst case scenario this tank would rupture and spill its entire cotents onto the ground in ten minutes.  Using the EPA lookup tables for this release, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.3 miles.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario.  The alternate release scenario is the discharge of chlorine from a broken valve on a ton cyclinder.  Based on a 3/4 inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 840 pounds of chlorine during a ten minute release.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release,  the distance to the toxic end point is 0.2 miles.\n\nAccidential Release Prevention Program.  The accidential release prevention program includes a combination of design, training and inspecting.  The chlorine system was designed according to"

The operators and contractors who work in and around the chlorine equipment have been trained in both the saftey and proper operating procedures.

On-site responders will respond to small accidental releases.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from off-site responding agencies.  The ERP states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidential release.  The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine.the ERP was last reviewed May 17,2004.  The ERP is coordinated with the Highland Fire Co.  The contact is the Fire Chief, at telephone (716) 627-1252.  The facility is also subject to OSHA 1910.120, OSHA Process Saftey Management Rules.\n"
