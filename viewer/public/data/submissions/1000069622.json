(WSU) has highly hazardous chemicals on-site that require the protection of our employees and environment.  The major objective of our Risk Management Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  By targeting highly hazardous chemicals, applicable standards can aid management in their efforts to prevent or mitigate episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace and possibly in the surrounding community.\n\n\n\nSafe work practices and procedures, along with safety rules, have been established in order to create the safest workplace possible.  The practices, procedures, and rules are reviewed on an annual and as needed basis and improved as necessary.  The practices, procedures, and rules are also communicated to workers and expected to be followed at all times.\n\n\n\nSenior management demonstrates their commitment to continuous improvement in environmental, health, safety & security through annual review of policies, procedures, communication, and resources.\n\n\n\nFacility and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nOur facility is approximately 40000 sq. ft. comprising warehouse and office space.  The warehouse is engaged in chemical distribution activities including:  storage, handling, packaging, mixing/blending, shipping, and receiving.  These activities include several hazardous chemicals (sodium hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid), non-hazardous materials (phosphate salts, ammonium sulfate), and some regulated substances (chlorine, sulfur dioxide).  While most chemical products do involve mixing and/or repackaging, none of the regulated substances are ever mixed or repackaged at our facility.  Regulated substance quantities can vary from day-to-day, however, the average daily quantity is above the threshold quantity established by EPA.  Typical daily quant"

We have had zero (0) accidental releases of regulated substances at any previous facility.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program covers typical emergency scenarios to a facility engaged in chemical distribution including:  fire, severe weather, and chemical release.  Our Emergency Action Plan details steps to be taken for reporting emergencies, evacuation, critical operations prior to evacuation, accounting for personnel, and training.  Employee training consists of presentations, tabletop exercises, and drills.  Chemical release emergencies are of particular concern, therefore procedures and training - intended to protect workers and the community - have been developed to respond appropriately.  Briefly, workers are trained to identify the severity of an accidental release.  Events that pose an immediate danger to life and health are cause for evacuation and reporting to local eme"
