FRI's management goals are achieved through the FRI Safety Committee, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbours, and regulators. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the Experimental Unit, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the Unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFRI conducts independent commercial-scale distillation experimentation programs operating with hydrocarbon systems at pressures ranging from deep vacuum to 500 psia.\n\n\n\nA flammable mixture consisting of iso-butane and normal butane is often present in the Experimental Unit in amounts above threshold quantity. This flammable mixture is regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP), Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by FRI. These high standards include:\n\n1. Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations,\n\n2. Operating and maintaining the Unit in a manner that minimizes unintentional releases,\n\n3. Operating and maintaining the Unit in a manner that minimizes the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance to the extent possible, and\n\n4. Correcting"

Part of this program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  At the FRI Experimental Unit, these include:\n\n1. Continuously monitoring the level of hydrocarbon vapors in the Experimental Unit,\n\n2. Continuously monitoring the hydrocarbon inventory with an inventory tracking list,\n\n3. Minimizing the possibility of a release of butane through engineering controls (relief systems, grounding equipment, manual shutoffs, etc.) and administrative controls (operating procedures, operator and contractor training, security systems, etc), and\n\n4. Minimizing the consequences of accidental releases of butane through mitigating systems (dikes, fire monitors, and steam snuffing systems).\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no releases of butane that have resulted in onsite injuries, deaths, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate emergency response actions necessary for the Experimental Unit with Oklahoma State University Environmental Health and Safety, the City of Stillwater, and the Payne county LERC.  An Emergency Response Plan for the Unit is in place.  The plan includes evacuation procedures, regular training, and emergency drills. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the EPA RMP and the OSHA PSM programs pr"

Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process technology, equipment, or procedures are considered;\n\n2. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provides a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards and leads to continuous improvements in safety; and\n\n3. The Mechanical Integrity Program ensures that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases and is an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture actions that will be taken to improve the level of safety at the Experimental Unit include:\n\n\n\n1. Internal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the elements of the PSM and RMP programs are functional and in compliance, and\n\n2. An on-going dialogue with the Oklahoma State University Safety Health and Environment and the Payne County LERC to implement improvements as needs develop. \n\n\n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Payne County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county. The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an on-going basis.\n\n"
