      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmmonia is one of the most prevalent extremely hazardous substances.  Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. To prevent and mitigate a Ammonia release and to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, Shamrock Farms Creamery has developed policies and programs to prevent accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of a Ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently Shamrock Farms Creamery has emphasized preventative maintenance, scheduling of replacement of parts, such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\nAll employees have been trained on relevant response procedures.  There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment.  The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action Plan also includes a procedure for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.   \n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nThe Shamrock Farms Creamery is located at 2434 East Pecan, Phoenix, Arizona, This facility Produces, freezes, and packages ice cream and novelty frozen products. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the Creamery facility as a refrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is contained within refrigeration piping and equipment, associated with Creamery operations.  The compressors and associated equipment are located inside the Engine Room, and the condensers"

      "SummaryText": "and first stage intercooler are located on the roof. The Company Piping and Instrumentation Diagram and detailed listing of components can be found in RMP binders.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is Ammonia.  There is approximately 28,000 lbs. of Ammonia on site.  Ammonia is considered an Acutely Hazardous Material and the amount maintained on site by Shamrock Farms Creamery exceeds the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) of 10,000 lbs. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - The Worst Case Scenario for Shamrock Farms Creamery is a 10 minutes release of Ammonia from a High Pressure Receiver. Therefore, the total release of Ammonia for the worst case scenario is 13,900lb. of Ammonia released over 10 minutes period.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the worst-case scenario is 7,883 ft (1.5 miles). The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\n  Alternative Scenario - The RMP regulations require that an alternate scenario be determined that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario.  The alternate release is also required to reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. Shamrock Farms Creamery in the HazOp study conducted to satisfy the California Risk Management Program identified a most likely as release of 822 lb of ammonia. This release occurs due to a forklift mast hits the hot gas line, located in the engine room (12 feet over the ground), causing an ammonia release. This release scenario satisfies the criteria for the Alternate Toxic Gas Release since it reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\n The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the alternate case scenario is 528 ft(0.1 miles).  This release would extend beyond the facility boundary.\n\nAll employees have been trained on relevant response procedure"

All maintenance employees have been trained in Ammonia refrigeration systems.  Shamrock Farms Creamery has developed a prevention program that includes safety information, a Hazard and Operability Study, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigations.\n\n 5.Five-year accidental history.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving Ammonia during the last 5 years at this facility.\n\n6.The emergency response program.\n\nIn addition to the Emergency Action Plan described in paragraph 1, plans for evacuation to ensure that the evacuation procedure is adequately addressed and the needs for drills will be assessed. This emergency response program was established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and includes procedures for handling small releases. \n\n\n\n7.Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThis facility will be conducting an independent audit in September, 1999 to ensure that all elements of the program are being met as required and documented."
