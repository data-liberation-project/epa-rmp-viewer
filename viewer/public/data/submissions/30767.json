Training includes emphasis on specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  This training must be passed through oral or written testing and the employee must demonstrate and verify that they understand the required operating procedures before they are allowed to operate the unit alone.  \n\nIn addition, all operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  This refresher training on the operating procedures is to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  Additionally, more frequent training will occur upon the request of the employee.  The appropriate frequency of training is decided by management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Plant uses contractors for selected maintenance, construction, and engineering service support activities.  The Lake Charles Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Lake Charles Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,  (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and "
