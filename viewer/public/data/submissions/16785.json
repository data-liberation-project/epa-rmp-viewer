The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to monitor that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Murphy refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and the controls that are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Murphy refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo verify that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Murphy refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to verify that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Murphy refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Murphy Oil USA, Inc. (Murphy) refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to monitor and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Murphy refinery, located in Meraux, Louisiana, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc., as well as hydrogen fluoride (HF), which is a regulated toxic substance.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with toxic substances at the refinery is a catastrophic failure in the Alkylation Unit, resulting in a release of 525,000 lb of HF gas over a 10-min period. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario in accordance with the regulation.  In addition, the HF acid storage drum, on which this scenario is based, is only filled to this capacity approximately once every 2 years.  Thus, even if this unlikely event did occur, it is even more unlikely that the vessel would be as full as we have assumed.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm for this scenario is 25 miles according to the EPA's lookup tables.\n\nThe worst-case scenario associated with a release of flammable substances at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion involving the full inventory of the largest storage ta"

No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of 1.7 million lb is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this scenario is 0.96 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario in accordance with the regulation.\n\nThe alternative scenario for hydrofluoric acid is a rupture of an unloading hose downstream of a hydrogen fluoride (HF) tank truck, which leads to the release of HF to the atmosphere.  The HF spills from the tank truck to the ground at a rate of 344 lb/min for the 1 min before the flow is stopped.  This release rate is based on the normal unloading rate adjusted for the sudden decrease in the terminal point pressure.  LPOOL estimates that the HF forms a pool with a maximum area of 168 sq ft and evaporates at a maximum rate of 15 lb/min.  HEGADAS estimates that the resulting cloud disperses downwind to the toxic endpoint of 20 ppm approximately 0.14 miles from the unloading area.  The LandView III software program estimates a population of 160 people within this distance.\n\nThe alternative scenario for flammables is a rupture of a 1.5-inch diameter pipe connected to the high pressure receiver.  We assume that it takes our operators 15 min to stop the release, even though they would likely complete this task much more quickly.  In addition, we assume that all of the material released during the 15 min stays in the cloud and explodes. In reality, only a small fraction of the material would still be flammable after this amount of time. The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this scenario is 0.15 miles.  Murphy has never experienced a release of this magnitude.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEAS"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Murphy refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Murphy refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in mate"

In addition to periodic local emergency planning committee (LEPC) meetings, the Murphy refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Murphy refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned:\n\nThe Meraux Refinery has recently purchased a 3000 gpm trailer mounted fire water pump.  This equipment greatly enhances emergency response efforts by giving personnel the mobility to produce high volumes of emergency response water nearer to potential incident sites.\n\nMurphy Oil Meraux Refinery employees have recently completed twenty-four hours, three days, of annual fire fighting, HAZMAT and incident command refresher training.  Sixty-six employees attended this training program.  The training consisted of; chemistry of hazardous materials, incident command, dry chemical fire extinguishers, LPG fire suppression, flammable liquids fire suppression, fire fighting foam applications, Level A HAZ MAT simulated leak response, fire truck water hydraulics and application of Hired Gun, 2000 gpm nozzle.\n\nQuarterly training for all emergency response team personnel will continue as usual.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Murphy refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

In addition, the Murphy refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Murphy refinery is coordinated with the St. Bernard Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, the fire department, and the sheriff's office. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials,"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo verify that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Murphy refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
