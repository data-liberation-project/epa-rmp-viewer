Our policy is to establish, maintain, and implement emergency response procedures with the prime objective of protecting all persons from harm, minimize property damage and mitigate impacts to the environment. The safety of our employees, emergency response personnel and persons in affected areas are the highest priority in the initial stages of an emergency. Our accidental release and emergency response procedure is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures, and training. Gibson energy US has developed a comprehensive accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operations at this facility. The Shelby facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan specific to this location. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately shut down operations, notify the Shelby Volunteer Fire Department to request their assistance and initiate evacuation of the affected area if needed. Gibson Energy US maintains a Health, Safety and Environmental manual to guide employees and contractors in daily operations at our facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nLiquid Propane is the only regulated chemical at our Shelby facility. The facility is a bulk storage terminal that receives propane by railroad tank cars and truck transports. The facility has one railroad tank car unloading stations. Propane is distributed from this facility using truck transports and propane dealer delivery trucks. This facility consists of two 18,000 gallon and four 30,000-gallon ASME aboveground bulk storage tanks. Each tank contains approximately 65,000 and 107,000 pounds of liquid propane respectively when filled to maxim"

The information includes the hazards of the process chemical, process technology information, and process equipment data. The process safety information is updated whenever process changes are made. Accurate process safety information enables employees involved in operating and maintaining the facility to identify and understand the hazards of the process. Process safety information is used to conduct a process hazard analysis on the existing process or a proposed modification to the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Gibson Energy US performs periodic detailed hazard analysis of our process to identify, evaluate, and control hazards in the process. Checklists and what-if scenario methodologies are utilized to perform the PHA. PHA's are conducted using a team of people experienced in operations, safety and maintenance procedures applicable to this facility. The PHA identifies potential deficiencies in the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional measures and/or improvements to our current system. PHA findings, recommendations and their resolution are documented. All PHA findings and recommendations are addressed and resolved in a timely manner. A Process Hazard Analysis will be performed on the Shelby facility every 5 years as required by the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been developed for the tasks that terminal operators and loading personnel must perform, the safe process operating parameters that must be maintained, and safety precautions for operations and maintenance activities.
