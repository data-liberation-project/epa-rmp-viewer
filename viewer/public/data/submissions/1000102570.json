      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\nAlto Columbia, LLC operates as a fuel ethanol production plant located in Boardman, Morrow County, Oregon. As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Alto Columbia, LLC has completed a 5-Year Update to its risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site that are above reporting thresholds. \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process co-product known as wet distillers' grain, Syrup and corn oil which are used as a livestock feed. Aqueous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control when blending the corn flour with water. The maximum aqueous ammonia stored will be approximately 25,000 gallons or 195,000 pounds. The ammonia tank is located in a concrete containment dike. Natural Gasoline used as Denaturant can contain pentane and butane in varying percentages depending on the location of the gasoline well it was harvested from. Alto Columbia has prepared this RMP based on a worst-case scenario (i.e., assumes the natural gasoline as 100% flammable mixture of RMP chemicals). The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be approximately 78,000 gallons or 440,000 pounds. The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is blended into the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike. Alto Columbia, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it relates to the reportable substances. An emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Alto Columbia, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts periodic drills.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nAlto Columbia, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater"
