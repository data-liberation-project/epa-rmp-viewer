With input from the CUPA, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) ammonia storage and handling system has been identified as the only process at the facility which triggers the CalARP RMP requirements. This process was determined to be covered by Prevention Program 2 requirements.\r\nOn March 31, 2004, the amendment to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) under the Clean Air Act Section 112 (r) (7) was signed. The amendment:\r\n* Requires a correction to reportable information on chemical accidents be added to the RMP within six (6) months of the date of the accident;\r\n* Requires that changes to emergency contact information be corrected within one (1) month;\r\n* Removes the requirement to include a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) in the RMP executive summary; and\r\n* Adds three (3) RMP data elements.\r\nEPA also amended the RMP*Submit format to expand the list of possible accident causes to include uncontrolled chemical reactions.  This amendment became effective on April 9, 2004 when it was published in the Federal Register.  In April 2008 EPA began work on RMP*eSUBMIT software which will replace RMP*Submit. RMP*eSUBMIT was released March 13, 2009. On that date additional modifications to the RMP regulation became effective, including changes to the accidental release 5-year recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response"

      "SummaryText": "Policies\r\nIt is the policy of Ormond Beach Generating Station (OBGS) that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any harm that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, OBGS strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \r\nOBGS implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\r\n\r\n1.2 Facility Description\r\nThe Ormond Beach Generating Station (Facility ID 1000 0009 5327) is located at 6635 South Edison Drive in Oxnard, California at the southern margin of the Oxnard Plain adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and approximately 60 miles west northwest of Los Angeles, California (34\u00b0 7' 44\" north, 119\u00b0 10' 4\" west).  The elevation of the facility is approximately 15 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake fault zones are the Malibu Coast-Santa Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Fault Zone 9 miles southeast of the site; the Oak Ridge Fault 9 miles north of the site; and the Ventura Fault 11 miles north of the site.\r\nThe station is located in a light to heavy industrial zone. The main area covers approximately 53 acres and is bounded by Edison Drive on the north and by the Pacific Ocean on the south. A Ventura County Railway spur (Union Pacific Railroad) runs into the property for transporting heavy equipment. This railroad is shared with other industrial facilities in the area.

Main Units 1 and 2 are each equipped with SCR for the control of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Aqueous ammonia is also used in the station water treatment system for pH control, and in the demineralizer system for the regeneration of anion and cation exchange resins.\r\nThe regulated substance used at the facility that is above California's threshold quantity (TQ) is aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide, 29% by weight).  All other regulated substances onsite are in quantities below applicable thresholds.\r\n\r\n1.2.1 Selective Catalytic Reduction\r\nAqueous ammonia (CAS 1336-21-6), 29% concentration by weight, with a vapor pressure of 9.1 psig at 60\u00b0F is used in the SCR system to control NOx emissions from two 7400 MMBtu/hr steam boilers (Units 1 and 2) as Best Available Control Technology (BACT). The SCR system reduces NOx emissions by injecting ammonia into the boiler exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst matrix. Ammonia, NOx, and oxygen react on the surface of the catalyst to form nitrogen and water. The low temperature catalyst is comprised of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) on a ceramic substrate and operates within a normal temperature range of 600\u00b0F to 750\u00b0F. A process flow diagram is contained in Appendix B. \r\n\r\n1.2.2 Regulated Substances\r\nAqueous ammonia is a toxic substance above the federal RMP and CalARP thresholds (19 CCR \u00a72770.5, Tables 1 and 3, respectively).  No regulated flammable substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities under the regulation. All quantities of other materials are also below applicable thresholds.\r\n* Aqueous ammonia, 29% by weight, 40,0000 gallons (max), 87,000 pounds (max) as NH3\r\nTable 1-1 shows capacities for determination of CalARP applicability for RMP."

VNX is a solid deposited on a ceramic honeycomb material (less than 5% in matrix), the design of which promotes interaction with the exhaust gas stream within the SCR.  As such, VNX remains within the SCR and is not released to the atmosphere. This substance, therefore, meets the definition of an article (\u00a72735.3) and is therefore exempted from the requirements of the CalARP program as per \u00a72770.2(b)(3).  VNX is not federally listed under 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\r\n\r\n1.3 Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Ormond Beach Generating Station uses aqueous ammonia in the SCR NOX reduction system.  Aqueous ammonia is a regulated substance and is present at the facility above the federal RMP and CalARP TQ. Therefore, OBGS is subject to the RMP and CalARP requirements. The facility is coded:\r\n* North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) as 221112\r\n* Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 4911\r\nIn accordance with the CalARP regulations and with the guidance of the Oxnard Fire Department as CUPA, it has been determined that the SCR system falls under the CalARP Prevention Program 2 requirement.\r\nCompliance with the CalARP comprehensive program validates the integrity of the processes which handle flammable or"

Application of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with CalOSHA Title 8 \u00a73220 (Emergency Action Plan) and OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans or EAP).  The basic concept of the emergency procedures is to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\r\nOBGS emergency procedures serve as a guide for emergency control staff, company personnel, emergency assistance groups and law enforcement agencies that may be called upon to participate in controlling an emergency within the facility and surrounding areas. These procedures include employee notification of emergencies and evacuation procedures for all emergency situations."
