      "SummaryText": "Anadarko E&P Onshore, LLC (Anardarko) owns and operates the Briscoe Friday CPF-A. The Briscoe Friday CPF-A is located in a remote area and is not normally occupied. The facility is a newly constructed and will receive production from area oil and gas wells via flowline. The production stream is treated to separate gas, water and condensate. The gas is further processed through a cryogenic process involving the rapid temperature and pressure change via a Joule-Thompson (JT) valve which causes the lighter hydrocarbons, including methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane, to condense forming a Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) product. The NGL product is stored in a pressurized bullet tank with a volume of 20,000 gallons and operating pressure at approximately 200 psi.\r\n\r\nA total rupture of the 20,000 gallon NGL tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion would pose the worse-case scenario for the Briscoe Friday CPF-A. The 20,000 gallon tank has been evaluated for total tank rupture using the RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis resulting in a distance to endpoint of 0.5 miles. Because no public receptors are within a 0.5 mile radius of the NGL tank and the facility is not normally occupied, this RMP has been evaluated for a Program 1 Level RMP under 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nSince the facility is newly constructed, there is no accident history to report. If an emergency involving the Briscoe Friday CPF-A NGL product tank occurs, the Anardarko policy is to notify the Dimmit County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. This policy has been discussed with the fire department."
