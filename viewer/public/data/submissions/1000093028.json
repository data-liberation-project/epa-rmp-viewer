The storage facility is located approximately 5.5 miles southeast of Putnam, Oklahoma (OK), and approximately 9 miles northwest of Thomas, OK.  The storage facility receives NGL from the Putnam Oswego Facility, which provides gathering system compression for the Putnam Oswego Unit.\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility is equipped with four pressure vessels (aka tanks) for NGL storage. The vessels' maximum operating pressure is 30 psig with a typical operating pressure of approximately 15 pounds per square inch gauge (psIg). There are two longer bullet vessels with dimensions of 8 feet in diameter by 30 feet long. The two shorter bullet NGL vessels have diameter of 8 foot in diameter and 15 feet in length. These larger vessels have a capacity of 10,920 gallons. The vessels have a common manifold with manual valves on the feed to each of the tanks. Normal operation would be to fill into all tanks jointly, unless maintenance or loading was being performed.\n\n\n\nThe vessels will vent back to an adjacent field gas gathering pipeline based on any over pressure within the vessels via back pressure control valve. The pipeline will route the vapor from the top of the vessels back to the field gathering system. With this venting, the normal maximum operating liquid level of the vessels is typically at a 90% level. \n\n\n\nBlake does not have any employees assigned to the Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility.  Routine checks are performed by the field pumpers. The truck loading is conducted as needed, approximately once every three days.  There is an emergency shutoff for the load out pump and loading line manifold for safe pumping to the NGL tank truck. In addition, there are excess flow valves on each bottom loading line at the vessels. There is"

The purified NGL product contains butane, ethane, methane, pentane, hexane (i.e., C6+) and propane.\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility is a RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nBlake Production Company, Inc.'s policy is to conduct its business in a manner that protects safety, health, and the environment. Blake's policy involves assessing the hazards and risks of an unplanned incident, developing a plan for managing those hazards and risks, communicating relevant information to employees, contractors, and appropriate agencies, and conducting emergency exercises.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBlake Production Company, Inc. encourages employees to participate in all facets of hazard assessment, hazard elimination, and safe work practices.\n\n\n\nBlake keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the storage and loading at the Satellite 5 site.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and specific chemical inventories and equipment designs basis/configuration information.  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego NGL Storage Facility is a new facility and thus has had no releases from the RMP Covered processes in the previous five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Putnam Oswego employees receive annual safety training that serves to maintain worker and public safety. The annual training covers the following topics: toxicology, hydrogen sulfide, chemical hazard communication, lockout/tagout, decontamination, personal protective equipment, incident command, firefighting, and hazardous materials handling.  Employees receive training specific to f"
