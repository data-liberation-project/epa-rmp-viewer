This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. This update is being submitted because of major modifications to a process.  This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \r\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining.'\r\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, industrial emergency response group comprised of FHR Employees (FHR Captains on shift and daylight personnel). In addition, the dedicated emergency response team is supported by 80-100 Emergency response team members that are comprised of FHR Operations, Ready for Maintenance and Maintenance personnel that are trained to the same level of industrial emergency response.  As a member company with the Refinery Terminal Fire Company (RTFC) over 50 trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium.

The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. Additionally, there is one EPA RMP toxic chemical handled above EPA RMP TQ at the refinery, and that is Hydrogen Fluoride.\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no RMP defined accidents that have occurred over the past five years involving EPA RMP regulated substances for the qualifying units.\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at FHR. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation included updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC). These teams contain members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, main"

These documents address chemical properties, their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Records Department within the refinery is the primary repository for process safety information. FHR also makes certain process safety information available on the FHR Intranet.\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures. The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nWithin the PHA program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards.

The analyses are conducted with a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The PHA team is led by a leader with experience and qualification in the HAZOP analysis technique. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  In addition, the team may request further review of some scenarios through the use of Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) or Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) in order to further evaluate the controls in place.\r\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System, LYNX. Within this system, an employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date. Responsible employees are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date. For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The results and findings from base and revalidation PHAs are documented and retained. \r\nOperat"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\nIn addition, FHR's policy is to maintain upper and lower safe operating limits for process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is available on the FHR Intranet and in the control room area.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address various aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release with off-site consequences occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, FHR has procedures that are designed to address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that are to be used to address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. When necessary, the emergency response program changes are administered through the Safety Department, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\r\nThe overall emergency response program for FHR is coordinated with FHR Emergency Response Team, RTFC, Local Emergency Response Agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). FHR has around-the-clock communications capability with these organizations. Annually on a quarterly basis, FHR's Emergency Response Team conducts drills that are evaluated for effectiveness if an emergency should ever occur. These drills and exercises are intended to provide a means to ensure the emergency public notification system is in working order, as well as facilitate practice and orderly response to potential emergency events.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nFHR's policy is to pursue continuous improvement through the use of tools such as follows: \r\n- Co"
