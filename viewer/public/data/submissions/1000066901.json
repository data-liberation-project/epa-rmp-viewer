All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\r\n\r\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, \"While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\r\n\r\nThe Willow Creek Plant processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The WCGP is a natural gas liquids (NLG) extraction facility designed to process 450 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the WCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid. The NGL rich gas is treated with amine to remove CO2 and any H2S. Next, water is removed using a molecular sieve dehydration system.  The gas flows into the cryogenic plant, where using pressure drop via turbo expander, the gas is cooled and heavier liquids condense. The residue gas flows to the recompressors and to the tailgate of the plant. The liquids produced are pumped out of the facility to OPPL (Overland Pass Pipeline). \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental"
