It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the ERP and drills are conducted annually.\n\n\n\nWilliams CEO, Alan Armstrong, has supported the commitment to safety in saying, \"While each [of Williams Core Values & Beliefs] are important, our commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship is critical, reminding us that Williams is committed to the health and safety of our work force and to the protection of our neighbors, the environment, and our assets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\n\n\nThe Willow Creek Plant processes raw natural gas into pipeline quality natural gas and other natural gas liquids. The raw natural gas is received by pipeline. The WCGP is a natural gas liquids (NLG) extraction facility designed to process 450 MMSCFD of raw field natural gas. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the WCGP is to separate NGL out of the raw field gas to produce a residue gas and natural gas condensate liquid. The NGL rich gas is treated with amine to remove CO2 and any H2S. Next, water is removed using a molecular sieve dehydration system.  The gas flows into the cryogenic plant, where using pressure drop via turbo expander, the gas is cooled and heavier liquids condense. The residue gas flows to the recompressors and to the tailgate of the plant. The liquids produced are pumped out of the facility to OPPL (Overland Pass Pipeline). \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\n?Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing modified equipment into service.\n\n\n\n?Mechanical Integrity: The Willow Creek Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors"

The Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Garfield County LEPC and emergency response organizations. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nIn response to the most recent Process Hazard Analysis, the Willow Creek Plant plans to evaluate additional engineering safeguards and continue training of employees and contractors. These additional safeguards will lessen the risk associated with the release of regulated substances."
