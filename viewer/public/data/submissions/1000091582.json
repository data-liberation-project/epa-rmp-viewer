Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response or emergency action programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and are improved, as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n-Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled -\r\n\r\nThe House of Raeford Arcadia facility includes one (1) ammonia refrigeration process in two (2) systems with cooling and freezing capabilities.

The Risk Management Plan for the House of Raeford Arcadia facility has been prepared for the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia in the facility's refrigeration system. Each part of the RMP is submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency, meeting or exceeding the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. \r\n\r\nThe submission is due to the need to fulfill the requirements mandated by the EPA for a new submission or an update to occur every 5 years. The RMP was resubmitted in accordance with the 5-year update requirement. The RMP resubmission was completed on January 11, 2021. Following EPA Guidance provided during an audit, House of Raeford removed a second unnecessary Worst-Case Scenario and updated inaccurate population estimates for offsite impacts. Additionally, emergency contact information has been updated.\r\n\r\n-Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response or Emergency Action Policies-\r\n\r\nThe House of Raeford Arcadia facility recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees, the environment, equipment, and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The controls of accidents have been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the House of Raeford Arcadia facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established an Emergency Action Plan. The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan are: to maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response or action prog"
