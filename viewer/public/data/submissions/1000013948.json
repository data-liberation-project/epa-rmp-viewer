This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Selective Catalytic Reduction System.  Calpine - Pastoria Energy Facility's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe facility utilizes ammonia for their Selective Catalytic Reduction System to control nitrous oxide emissions.

      "SummaryText": "isks; Calpine - Pastoria Energy Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\r\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\r\n\u00bf\tThere are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\r\n\u00bf\tThe system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\r\n\u00bf\tPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\r\nThe history of Calpine - Pastoria Energy Facility (i.e., no RMP -applicable ammonia releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Selective Catalytic Reduction System. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAs part of the implementation of RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Calpine - Pastoria Energy Facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia.
