              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to the nurse tanks. The conditions of the nurse tanks are observed during these times. In so doing, the employees are able to detect problems before they arise. The routine inspections identify any portions of the system (including nurse tanks) which may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with the storage, transfer, handling, and transportation of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires and part-time, seasonal employees. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding. Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the storage plant and other sites of interest to them. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Society (Siouxland Farmers Cooperative Association and/or C-D Farm Service) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occir, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 258,120 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank rleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tanks as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 1.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distanct to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulation.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occu"

Firve year accident history.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia our personnel have been instructed to immediately evacuate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Melvin Fire Department (via a 911call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Osceola County LEPC will bemade.\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n- a written emergency response plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, includind pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.
