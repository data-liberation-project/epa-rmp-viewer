This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental \r\nrelease prevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, installation, \r\nmanagement practices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training \r\nassociated with the chlorination process at our facility.  The chlorination system at our \r\nplant is designed to meet industry standards and is well maintained.  Appropriate controls \r\nand alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine.  Furthermore, all \r\napplicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention \r\nProgram Level 2 are adhered to.  \r\nIn the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the \r\nJackson County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, as \r\nwell as, Harcros Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  These institutions provide \r\nhighly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the \r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n2. Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nOur facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant.  Our primary activity is \r\ntreating potable water and pumping it into the Board\u00bfs distribution system for public use.  \r\nWe provide water to the residents, businesses, and industries in Scottsboro, AL and much \r\nof Jackson County, AL.  We have one regulated substance, Chlorine.  Chlorine is used \r\nfor disinfecting the water.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 12,000 \r\npounds.\r\n\r\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\r\n\r\nTwo possible chlorine release scenarios, a \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative \r\nscenario\u00bf were analyzed in accordance with EPA\u00bfs RMP regulations.

The following paragraphs provide details of the \r\nchosen scenarios.\r\n The worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of \r\nchlorine in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified \r\nfailure.  Our largest vessel is a ton (2,000 pounds) container.  Neither passive nor active \r\nmitigation was considered.  At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s windspeed, and a \r\ntemperature of 101?F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is obtained corresponding to a \r\ntoxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was \r\nestimated to be approximately 6893.  Several public receptors and no environmental \r\nreceptors were identified in the toxic endpoint area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is \r\nmore likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The scenario chosen involves a \r\ntubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the \r\n5/16 diameter valve body opening.  The total quantity released is 317 pounds with an \r\naverage release rate of 5.28 pounds per minute and a maximum sustained release rate of \r\n10.5 pounds per minute.  At class D atmospheric stability, a 3.0 m/s windspeed, and a \r\ntemperature of 101?F, a maximum distance of 0.57 miles is obtained corresponding to a \r\ntoxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was \r\nestimated at 213.  A few public receptors and no environmental receptors were identified \r\nin the toxic endpoint area.\r\n\r\n4.
