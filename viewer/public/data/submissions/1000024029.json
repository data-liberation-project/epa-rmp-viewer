      "SummaryText": "A.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\r\nAt the Kaneka Texas Pasadena facility, there are four chemicals covered by the EPA\u00bfs RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68).  They are: Acrylonitrile, 1-3 Butadiene, Chlorine and Propylene Oxide.  It is vital to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to personal health and safety of ourselves, our co-workers, our contractors, the community and our environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these chemicals combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of our facility, as well as the safe handling procedures that we use to train our personnel.\r\nThe facility maintains an emergency response plan that defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The plan includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for employees not directly involved in the response, and actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures.  Drills and exercises are routinely conducted to test the facility\u00bfs plans and revise the plans if necessary. \r\nThe emergency response plan also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, including emergency response personnel, the local Channels Industry Mutual Aid (CIMA) agency, the Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER) organization and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \r\n\r\nB.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\r\nKaneka Corporation engages in the manufacturing of synthetic resins, plastic products, chemicals and electrical raw materials and synthetic fibers. Its products include MBS (modifier resin) resin, used to improve the shock, weather, and heat resistance of various t"

This RMPlan includes all three units as the quantities, process conditions and locations of all covered chemicals are known at this time.  \r\n \r\nThe Modifiers unit handles two RMP-covered chemicals: \r\n\u00bf  1, 3-Butadiene (flammable) with a maximum inventory of 452,000 lbs; and\r\n\u00bf  Acrylonitrile (toxic) with a maximum inventory of 132,000 lbs.\r\nThe primary purpose of the butadiene and acrylonitrile are as raw materials to create a polymer which is blended with plastics, such as PVC, for impact improvement, as well as applications for window frames and siding.\r\nCPVC handles one chemical: \r\n\u00bf  Chlorine (toxic) with a maximum possible inventory of 180,000 lbs.\r\nChlorine is reacted in a water slurry with the PVC.  The resultant CPVC powder is conveyed to railcar for shipping.  CPVC is used in the manufacturing of hot water plastic pipes.  \r\nMSA handles one chemical:\r\n\u00bf  Propylene oxide (toxic) with a maximum possible inventory of 220,500 lbs.\r\nPropylene Oxide (PO) is brought onsite by tank truck and reacted with other organic chemicals to make a modified silicone liquid.  The end product is used in the manufacturing of sealants.\r\nThe Pasadena facility is equipped to safely unload tank trucks and railcars into storage vessels.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility personnel, management and contractors.\r\n\r\nC.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThe Kaneka facility is a PSM-covered facility and, as such, it has a viable and robust process safety program.  \r\nProcess Hazards Analyses have been conducted on processes containing all four RMP-covered chemicals.  Major hazards identified include fire, explosion, toxic c"

Fire protection is also provided for areas containing the flammables Butane and 1, 3-Butadiene.  \r\nTraining is conducted continuously and includes classroom, on-the-job mentoring and standard operating procedure (SOP) reviews.  Testing and demonstration are used as means to verify understanding.  SOPs are kept evergreen through a continuous review and revision process that is managed by designated individuals in each process unit.\r\nThe site has both predictive and preventative maintenance programs which include inspections, tests and routine maintenance activities that are performed by trained and competent employees and contractors.  Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.  There is a system in place to correct identified deficiencies.  Additionally, there is a quality assurance program in place which reviews individual workmanship as well as new and spare parts.\r\nChange is managed through a management-of-change (MOC) process.  The MOC process outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before they startup.  Additionally, changes undergo a pre-startup safety review conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility\u00bfs Pre-startup Safety Review procedure.\r\nA PSM and RMP compliance audit was conducted in April 2008.
