Bishop Facility. The EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) has many elements including hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs. An RMP is required when facilities use EPA specified chemicals at quantities within the defined criteria. The RMP substances handled at the Facility are formaldehyde, methyl formate, hydrogen flouride, acetaldehyde, and titanium tetra chloride.\n\nThe information submitted in the RMP includes accident prevention and safety programs, emergency preparedness and response programs, chemical descriptions, five year accidental history, which is zero, alternate release scenario and the worst case scenario. The RMP requires covered facilities to develop a worst case scenario for a release of covered chemicals from a site as well as a more realistic release scenario (alternate release scenarios). The sharing of this type of information is a means to improve community awareness, prevention and emergency response planning, not a prediction of the probability that either a worst case or more likely case scenario would ever occur. These scenarios are estimates required by EPA and are used to illustrate the importance of risk reduction, safety, prevention and emergency preparedness and response.\n\nThe Bishop plant is committed to Environmental Health and Safety Excellence. The Plant maintained OSHA's Certification on its Voluntary Protection Program ? VPP as well as achieving ? Stars Among Stars? status. The facility has dedicated Process Safety Resources that concentrate on overall operational safety. The Onsite Emergency response team is well trained and equipped to"

Our 5 year accidental release history has not resulted in any RMP incidents.\n\nBrief History  \n\nThe Bishop plant started operating in 1945 to produce chemicals needed for the U.S. war effort. Covering approximately1400 acres in southwest Nueces County, the plant produces engineering plastics, organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals products. The plant operates around the clock, seven days a week.. Approximately 430 full-time employees and 280 contract employees work at the Bishop Facility.\n\nLocal Expenditures\n\n-Annual payroll is more than $ 50 million\n-Annual purchases, many made within 50 miles, exceed $ 12 million\n-Annual school and property taxes are more than $ 6 million\n\nPrimary Business Activity\n\nThe Bishop Plant produces more than three billion pounds of product each year. They are used in the manufacture of many household and other common items, such as:\n\nPaints and varnishes, pharmaceuticals, printing inks, toys, office and video equipment, wood products and glues, automobile parts, photographic film, windshield washer fluid, electric products, fertilizers, motor oils & carburetor cleaners, kitchen appliances, furniture, computer key board caps.\n\nOther Pertinent Information\n\n-Texas Chemical Council (TCC) - Best in Texas EHS Award in 1998 and 2003\n-Texas Chemical Council - Distinguished Service Award for Safety in 2003                                                                 \n-Texas Chemical Council - Caring for Texas-Responsible Care Award in 2003 \n-OSHA VPP \"Star Among Stars\" Award in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003    \n-Corpus Christi Port Industries Committee - Safety Excellence Award in 2001, 2002, 2003 \n-Society Of Plastics Industry, Inc.
