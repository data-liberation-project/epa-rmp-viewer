Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies The top priority of the 1029 Montague facility is to provide a healthy and safe work\r\nenvironment for its employees and the surrounding community. In this effort, the facility has developed strict policies and procedures to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous chemical release. The Risk Management (RMP) program acts as a gatekeeper of these policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nThe facility prevents accidents by designing for safety, taking care of our equipment, operating safely, and auditing our operations. 1029 Montague facility has an active Process Safety Management (PSM) program in place under Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which is audited every three years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe facility is located in Milpitas, CA. The facility is a refrigerated warehouse using Anhydrous Ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) as the refrigerant in a closed-loop system. \r\n\r\n3.
