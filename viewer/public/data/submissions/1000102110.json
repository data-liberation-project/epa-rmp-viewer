An incident investigation program is in place at the Facility and incident investigations would be implemented if needed.\n\n\nES - 6.0 THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Riverbank Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The procedures describe the manner of response to a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The overall emergency procedure program for the Riverbank Terminal is coordinated with the Stanislaus County Emergency Management Program. This coordination involves periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives. The Riverbank Terminal has around the clock communications capability with appropriate Emergency Management Program officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Stanislaus Consolidated Fire District). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\nThe facility's emergency response program is developed in accordance with Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code, Hazardous Materials Business Plan requirements. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\nES - 7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the Riverbank Terminal."

The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS: \nPeriodic compliance audits to assess the effectiveness of the written plan must be conducted every three years. Plant operations and management personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution. \n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION: \nThe Riverbank Terminal has procedures in place that require prompt investigation of incidents that resulted in or could have reasonably resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: \nThe Facility must rely upon the operational expertise and training of its employees at all levels and disciplines to ensure safe operations.

A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.\nThe training program is comprised of the following:\n~ Initial employee training;\n~ Periodic refresher training (provided at least every three years);\n~ Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification;\n~ Competency testing involving written tests and observation following training; and\n~ Training records for each employee.\n\nMAINTENANCE PROCEDURES & MECHANICAL INTEGRITY: \nThe maintenance program at the Riverbank Terminal is intended to preserve the mechanical integrity of the process equipment to minimize the potential for an accidental release. The Riverbank Terminal has established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include \n(1) training, \n(2) developing written procedures, \n(3) performing inspections and tests, \n(4) correcting equipment deficiencies. \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Equipment inspections are conducted on a monthly or quarterly basis. The frequency of the inspection is based upon regulatory framework impacting the particular system or subsystem.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: \nThe Kiva Energy Riverbank Terminal employs a change management system that requires changes to various systems or items, such as process equipment, technology, procedures and other facility functions, be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.

Those vessels are \n~ A-Bank-1 : A-Bank-4;\n~ B-Bank-1 : B-Bank-4;\n~ C-Bank-1 : C-Bank-4; and\n~ D-Bank-1 : D-Bank-4.\n\nVessel Capacity (gals) Maximum Volume Mass of LPG\n~LPG Tank \n    30,000 gallons, shell capacity\n    25,500 gallons, 85% volume limit\n    107,610 lbs of propane at 85% full\n\n~ A-Bank-1 thru D-Bank-4 \n    4 LPG vessels per bank, 4 banks\n    480,000 gallons, shell capacity\n    408,000 gallons, 85% volume limit\n    1,721,760 lbs of propane at 85% full\n\nThe maximum amount of LPG present within the interconnected storage vessels is 1,721,760 lbs.

If an accidental release should occur, the facility staff are prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed Consolidated Emergency Response / Contingency Plan (CCP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n\nES - 2.0 FACILITY INFORMATION\nThe Riverbank Propane terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility. The facility receives odorized and un-odorized propane LPG by rail car. The liquefied petroleum gas is stored in the facility's 16 aboveground, pressurized storage tanks prior to being loaded into DOT approved delivery trucks (including those owned by Kiva Energy as well as third-party distributors).\n\nKiva Energy uses propane vapor compressors to offload the contents of the rail cars spotted on the facility rail siding. The same compressors are subsequently used to remove vapors from the empty cars prior to their disconnection from the tank fill piping and railcar unloading racks. Kiva Energy can receive non-odorized propane at this location. Kiva Energy adds ethyl mercaptan to the propane as the liquefied, compressed gas is conveyed to the storage tanks. Odorized propane is not dosed with additional odorant. \n\nThe odorized propane, stored in the 16 tanks located on site, is transferred to 18-wheel transport trucks or smaller bobtail propane delivery. The terminal operator is responsible for the hookup, unloading and disconnecti"
