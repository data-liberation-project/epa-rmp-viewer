The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their effects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\r\n\t\r\n\tWritten operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Hopewell has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors.\r\n\r\n\tBesides standard operating procedures, Hopewell has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.  These training materials have been developed by the operators themselves and include their knowledge from years of on-the-job service.  The training program is supported with computer based training modules as well as hands-on training by qualified area trainers. Operators are trained on computers that simulate real-life plant situations before they can qualify to work in the operating areas of the plant.  Hopewell operators are required to complete a three-year training program before becoming fully qualified.\r\n\t\r\n\tMechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way Hopewell reduces the probability and consequences of potential releases.  On-going inspection programs are a key part of maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Guidelines and procedures have been developed and are followed by people performing the inspections.  Hopewell personnel are trained and qualified to analyze data and provide operation"

Quality assurance of new equipment, processes and spare parts provide additional confidence that the equipment containing the process chemicals will perform as designed.  \r\n\t\r\n\tHopewell's contractor safety program encompasses contractor screening for suitability to perform to AdvanSix, Resins & Chemicals standards. Contractors working on-site meet the strict safety requirements including: \r\n\u00bf\tA comprehensive safety orientation\r\n\u00bf\tQualification and training documentation\r\n\u00bf\tHazard communication program\r\n\u00bf\tFormal audit system\r\n\u00bf\tAn accident-investigation procedure\r\n \r\n\r\n(4)  Five-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nTwo recorded incidents in the last five years are included in this submittal. Hopewell has notified the US EPA regarding each of these events.  \r\n\r\n\r\n(a)\tOn March 12, 2013, during the washout operation of an ammonia vaporizer (VA-32) approximately 9,700 lbs. of ammonia vapor was released from a flanged joint which failed.  The release occurred as the result of a valve not being in the fully open position creating a water hammer type effect on the associated piping and flanged joints. The release was terminated with exception of a very small wisp which was controlled by water spray after 2 hours and thirty-two minutes. The site did initiate an on-site only shelter-in-place. No on-site injuries were reported and no off-site injuries or environmental impacts were reported or are known.\r\n\r\n(b)\tOn June 8, 2016, an oleum release occurred from a section of transfer piping during the unloading of an oleum railcar in the Sulfuric Acid Production area.  The Hopewell site immediately notified local authorities and industrial neighbors of the event while activating our internal Shelter-in-Place plan.  The released liquid was contained on-site; however, some vapors being released from the material did cross the facility boundary going towards an industrial neighbor.  The City of Hopewell did not initiate a Shelter"

Railcar transfer shutdown and system isolation measures were initiated by onsite personnel keeping the duration of the release to approximately six (6) minutes.   Four (4) contractors working at the industrial neighbor's facility were exposed to some of the vapors but no known off-site injury was noted as they were evaluated and released without receiving any medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5)  Emergency Response Plan:\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of Hopewell to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety and environmental risks related to its operations.  By designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment and by conducting and regularly reviewing and improving processes and programs, Hopewell has an active prevention strategy for its chemical processes. Chemical risk management involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response planning, maintenance of process and emergency response equipment, coordination of resources and plans with the local and state emergency services and communication with the community.\r\n\r\nThe plan is designed to alert employees by an audible alarm system and as the situation dictates, notify the community through the local police and fire departments.  Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Communication is provided through a specialized radio service, where Hopewell can review the situation and coordinate directly with other emergency response agencies.  Direct 2-way radio links are in place to quickly notify local school systems and media sources.  \r\n\r\nHopewell has its own emergency response brigade made up of approximately 80 trained, qualified, certified emergency response indiv"

These responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools in Texas and Nevada.  These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and local police, fire, rescue and other emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year. \r\n\r\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nHopewell strives to continually improve process safety at the site.  Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \r\n\r\nAlso, Hopewell benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.  As one part of the investigation tool, we have trained about 180 salaried and hourly employees in root cause analysis, an investigative system designed to identify and correct the causes of equipment and procedural failures.  It is widely used to help improve our level of safety and environmental performance.\r\n\r\n\tManaging change is a key activities task associated with process safety and risk management.  Detailed procedural steps have been developed to provide guidance for operations personnel in making necessary process and mechanical changes to maintain a safe plant and achieve a high level of performance.  Multi-departmental approvals are required before proceeding with requested changes.  This management of change process incorporates:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess hazard analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating procedure updates\r\n\u00bf\tMechan"
