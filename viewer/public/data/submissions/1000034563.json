Improvements are identified and implemented throughout the facility's planning and operating cycles.  The employees at Hopewell are committed to the safe and reliable operation of the plant in a manner that safeguards life, health, property and the environment. The process safety and risk management initiatives are implemented as proactive approaches to minimize the potential for accidental releases.  \n\n\n\nEach of the four chemicals on the EPA list at Hopewell has been evaluated based on the EPA's guidelines.  Specific information related to each chemical is supplied in our risk management plan, available from the EPA.  Hopewell has numerous safety devices to prevent and/or reduce the chance of a release occurring.  Examples of these devices include:\n\n?    Remote operated shutoff valves\n\n?    Remote detectors\n\n?    Continuous monitoring \n\n?    Containment dikes \n\n\n\n    Hopewell has established specific guidelines and procedures for compiling and maintaining written information for the chemical processes we operate.  Specific responsibilities for maintaining this process safety information have been identified and assigned to qualified individuals.  The plant's hazard communication program communicates the health and environmental effects of chemicals to our employees.

The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their effects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n\n    \n\n    Written operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Hopewell has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors.\n\n\n\n    Besides standard operating procedures, Hopewell has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.  These training materials have been developed by the operators themselves and include their knowledge from years of on-the-job service.  The training program is supported with computer based training modules as well as hands-on training by qualified area trainers. Operators are trained on computers that simulate real-life plant situations before they can qualify to work in the operating areas of the plant.  Hopewell operators are required to complete a three-year training program before becoming fully qualified.\n\n    \n\n    Mechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way Hopewell reduces the probability and consequences of potential releases.

The release occurred as the result of a valve not being in the fully open position creating a water hammer type effect on the associated piping and flanged joints. The release was terminated with exception of a very small wisp which was controlled by water spray after 2 hours and thirty-two minutes. The site did initiate an on-site only shelter-in-place. No on-site injuries were reported and no off-site injuries or environmental impacts were reported or are known.\n\n\n\n(b)    On June 8, 2016, an oleum release occurred from a section of transfer piping during the unloading of an oleum railcar in the Sulfuric Acid Production area.  The Hopewell site immediately notified local authorities and industrial neighbors of the event while activating our internal Shelter-in-Place plan.  The released liquid was contained on-site; however, some vapors being released from the material did cross the facility boundary going towards an industrial neighbor.

Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Communication is provided through a specialized radio service, where Hopewell can review the situation and coordinate directly with other emergency response agencies.

Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \n\n\n\nAlso, Hopewell benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.  As one part of the investigation tool, we have trained about 180 salaried and hourly employees in root cause analysis, an investigative system designed to identify and correct the causes of equipment and procedural failures.
