Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n-  The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n-  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) methods used to perform Hazard Reviews serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n-  The Safety Information and Maintenance provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained in such a manner as to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n-  Internal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\n-  An ongoing dialogue with the Cass County Emergency Management Coordinator or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Cass"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n-  Hazardous atmosphere monitors (HAM) have been installed at the facility, which will shut down power to the loading facility upon a positive reading.\n-  Manual emergency shutdown (ESD) buttons have been installed at the facility in order to shut down the entire facility during emergency situations.\n-  Fire eyes have been installed which will alarm to warn of a fire at the facility.\n-  The Tulsa Control Center, which is operated 24 hours per day, can detect high and low pressure on the pipeline and storage vessels as well as levels on storage vessels, and remotely close inlet and outlet valves, if necessary.\n-  All drivers are provided with driver loading safety training and a driver loading handbook.\n\t\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\t\nNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or property damage or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Plattsmouth Terminal within the last five years. \n\t\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\t\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Plattsmouth Terminal wit"

At the facility, propane is received via pipeline and stored in above ground storage tanks until it is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is used as an odorant for propane and is stored at the facility and injected into truck trailers during propane loading.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) substances stored at the facility are propane and ethyl mercaptan.  These are the only flammable RMP substances stored at the facility.  No RMP toxic substances are present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.
