(507)249-3196\n\nFor futher information contact: Nathan Preuss, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Harvest Land Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anydrous ammonia and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n     - The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers and/or propane for sale to farmers.\n\n     - Anydrous ammonia and propane are received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n     - The maximum quantity stored for anydrous ammonia would be 210,000 pounds and propane would be 109,000  pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario\n\n     a. The worst-case release scenario for ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 105,000 pounds for Anydrous Ammonia, and 109,000 pounds for propane, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm ) is 1.12 miles for anydrous ammonia, and distance to 1 PSI overpressure is .43 miles for propane.\n\n     b. The alternative release scenario for ammonia, based on a 2 minute release from a  3 inch pipe break is .78 miles.  The distance to the endpoint for propane is .29 miles (.67 factor multiplied by .43 miles) for propane, based on a vapor cloud explosion using EPA Look-up Tables.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the p"

CFR 1910.11, \" Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia \".\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n     a. There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that:\n   \n     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor\n\n     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite death, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n     - The facility has:\n\n     a. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38:\n\n     b. Provide state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right - to - know                  information as required under SARA Title III ( EPCRA ).\n\n     c. Has coordinated with emergency responders.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of the safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anydrous ammonia and/or propane safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
