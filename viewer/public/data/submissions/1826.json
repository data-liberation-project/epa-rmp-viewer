      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Sysco Food Services facility commenced operations in September 1998.  This facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)  To save lives.\n2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)  To protect the environment.\n4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nSysco Food Services maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to moving into a new facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Sysco Food Services ammonia refrigeration system startup occurred during the week of August 11, 1998 with Sysco Food Services personnel taking full responsibility for operating the entire facility in September 1998.  The facility is located at 12180 Kirkham Road, Poway, California 92064.  The facility was constructed in accordance with the most recently adopted Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 11,000 pounds of ammonia for warehouse cold storage.  It provides cooling for several cold storage areas: -100F freezer, 280F cooler, 500F cooler, 340F cooler, 400F cooler, 550F cooler, and 450F dock.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the control box and diffusion tank are located outside t"

      "SummaryText": "he engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR), where the pressure is reduced from 181 psig to 103 psig.  The CPR serves as the main storage vessel for the system.  It also supplies liquid ammonia to the High Temperature Recirculator (HTR) which pumps the liquid to the evaporators (21) throughout the facility.  The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for warehouse/dock storage in seven different zones.  As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is vaporized and returned to the HTR, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 27 psig.\n\nThe HTR also routes the liquid from the CPR to the Low Temperature Recirculator (LTR), which further reduces the pressure of the ammonia to 1.3 psig.  The LTR supplies liquid ammonia to the freezer evaporators (6) and collects the resulting vaporized ammonia.  The Booster Compressor pulls this low pressure ammonia vapor from the LTR and discharges higher pressure vapor to the HTR.  The High Stage Compressors (2) pull this booster discharge from the HTR and further compress it.  This high stage discharge (hot gas) from the High Stage Compressors is piped to the condenser, where the ammonia is converted back to high pressure liquid and recycled to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  The auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensibles collected in the CPR and the condensers.  The system also has a dilution tank (into which the relief header vents), which maintains a water level at 70% capacity to allow for ammonia charge. \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release\nThe worst case release for this facility was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the largest vesse"

      "SummaryText": "l in 10 minutes.  The largest vessel is designed to hold the entire charge of 11,000 pounds.  No mitigation measures were incorporated into the release rate calculation.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed and F stability. The facility is located in an urban setting.  This scenario has a very low probability of occurrence and is considered to be the worst case.  The INPUFF dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\nAlternative Release\nThe alternative release scenario is a leak in a high pressure vapor (hot gas) line (on the roof of the facility) feeding an evaporator.  To be conservative, a 0.25\" diameter hole in the 2.5\" hot gas line will be modeled.  The release rate is 8 lbs/min based on the hole size.  This release is similar to that of the worst case release in that the release will be pressurized ammonia vapor.  As the hot gas defrost cycle does not operate continuously (only on a timer basis), the duration of the release scenario is limited to the defrost cycle time length, but to be conservative, a release time of 60 minutes will be used.  This scenario is mitigated by a procedure; an operator visually inspects the roof piping runs and the evaporator coils periodically.  The meteorological conditions used were 3.0 meters/second wind speed and D stability. The facility is located in an urban setting.  The INPUFF dispersion model was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 200 ppm.  The release reaches off-site and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Sysco Food Services facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the 1994 Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically ou"
