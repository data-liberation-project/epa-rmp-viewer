The Chester facility began a formal Process Safety Management Program in 1992 when OSHA promulgated ?29 CFR 1910.119.  Process Safety Management in concert with effective engineering design, Employee Safety Programs, American Chemical Council's Responsible Care Program, and Emergency Response Programs make up the Chester faciity's Accident Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe following is a partial list of activities performed at the facility that are intended to prevent emergency situations from occurring or, in the unlikely event of an emergency, being prepared to respond quickly.\n\n\n\n?    Active participation in the Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\n?    Financial support of local emergency responders\n\n?    Regular mechanical integrity inspections and testing of equipment\n\n?    Identification and mitigation of hazards through Process Safety Programs\n\n?    Testing alarms and safety systems to ensure they function properly\n\n?    Ongoing employee safety training and drills\n\n?    Onsite emergency response personnel\n\n?    Contractor safety evaluations\n\n?    24-Hour security\n\n?
