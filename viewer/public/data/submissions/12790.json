Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia are the result of a lack of knowledge, misunderstanding, carelessness or poorly maintained or unsuitable equipment.\n\nThe Reddy East Point facility is committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the general public, and the environment.  The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process.  These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, exhaust purge fans, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are violated, and the capability of shutting the entire system down if required.  Administrative controls are in place which limit the utilization of vessels at approximately 50% of their intended capacities.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency response and action plan which includes notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, to evacuation and first responder duties.\n\n\fMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe Reddy East Point facility has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  A single person has been identified that has overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the risk management program requirements.\n\nThere may be different levels of responsibility assigned, depending on the size and complexity of the facility.  A Risk Management Coordinator may be responsible for developing and implementing the overall risk management program, while other personnel may be responsible for developing and implementing the operating procedures element or developing a particular operating procedure.  The management system is, therefore, operating at each of these levels depending on the way these responsibilities are carried out.\n\nThe Risk Management Coordinator is responsible for all aspects of the development and update of the overall Risk Management Program.

The scenarios related to a worst case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  This involved calculating worst case and alternative scenarios utilizing the RMP*Comp modeling program.\n\nThe facility considered worst case release scenarios relating to the Turbo system accumulator within the enclosed ammonia system, as it would house the largest mass of a regulated substance at any given time.

      "SummaryText": "The Reddy East Point facility located in East Point, Georgia manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution.  The facility utilizes approximately 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage.\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems with standard refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as its refrigerant.  The systems are referred to as the Turbo and Tube systems. Each of the systems has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor if operating limits are violated.\n\nThe Turbo system consists of six 100-ton TIGAR Turbo icemakers and handles all the plant refrigeration requirements.  The system consists of four compressors; two 700 HP driven Frick screw compressors, one 400 HP driven Dunham Bush screw compressor, and one 300 HP driven Frick screw compressor.  An RWB II Plus Panel provides control for each of the compressors, inclusive of a standard 3-phase starter system with safety shutdown features utilizing normal refrigeration pressure controls and cutout protection.  The four Turbo system compressors are economized and maintain a suction pressure of approximately 12 psi on the ice maker and refrigeration evaporators.\n\nThe system compresses the anhydrous ammonia gas to a pressure of approximately 160 psi and discharges the gas into five water evaporative condensers located on the roof of the engine room which houses the compressors.  As the gas is liquified in the condensers, it flows into a pilot vessel, holding approximately 1000 pounds at 160 psi, where float switches control solenoid valves which allow the liquid to flow into a medium pressure receiver.  This receiver maintains a pressure of near 47 psi and contains a level of approximately 9 feet (10,000 pounds) of refrigerated ammonia at 32  F.\n\nThe medium pressure vessel serves as the anhydrous ammonia supply storage."

      "SummaryText": "This vessel, equipped with high-level shutdown protection, feeds the accumulator vessel located at the end of the suction line and provides protection to the compressor from liquid ammonia.  Float controls maintain approximately 9 feet (10,000 pounds) of refrigerated ammonia at 0 F and 15 psi in this accumulator.  This refrigerated anhydrous ammonia supply is pumped to the ice maker and refrigeration evaporators.  Sensors monitor output pressure from the ammonia pumps and regulate frequency inverters that control the pump motor speed.  This process continues as long as the system is operating.\n\nThe Tube system consists of four 40-ton Cassco tube ice makers equipped with two 200 HP Frick screw compressors and two Micom reciprocating compressors with 75 and 100 HP, respectively.  The two Frick compressors are operated by an RWB II Plus control panel and the two Micom compressors have a standard 3-phase starter with standard safety shutdown features utilizing normal refrigeration pressure controls with cutout protection.\n\nThe Tube system compressors maintain a suction pressure of approximately 170 psi and discharge the gas into two water evaporative condensers located on the roof of the engine room, housing the compressors.  As the gas is liquified in the condensers it flows back to a high-pressure receiver (approximately 5,000 pounds at 170 psi) located in the engine room.  As required, liquid anhydrous ammonia from the receiver is routed by pressure through the coils in the ice makers which pre-chills the liquid ammonia and supplies an accumulator (approximately 3000 pounds at 25 psi) vessel located above the receiver.  The refrigerated liquid ammonia is then pumped to the evaporator area of the ice makers.  This process continues as long as the system is operating.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to the facility to replenish the ammonia in the system, as required.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigeran"
