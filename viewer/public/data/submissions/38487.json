We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a  brief overview of our comprehensive rick management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibilityof an acidental relase of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the relase of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility produces a number of products that include Propylene Oxide (PO), Styrene Monomer (SM), Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE), Polyether Polyols (Polyols), and an assortment of products from the Butanediols (BDO) unit, including Allyl Alcohol (AA).  There are two POSM units, one MTBE unit, one Polyols unit, and one BDO unit.  These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identifed by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequencees in the event of their substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nPropylene Oxide (PO): Approximately 35 million lbs. are on-site based on storage, production and use.  PO is the major product of the CVOS facility and is also a feedstock for the Polyols and BDO production "

AA is a product produced in the BDO unit.\n\n\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO): Approximately 1.5 million lbs. are stored and used on-site.  EO is a primary feedstock of the Polyols unit.\n\n\n\nAnnhydrous Ammonia (NH3): Approximately 140,000 lbs. of NH3 are stored on-site to be utilized in the control of Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) in the Utilities area.  The NH3 storage is in final construction for start-up in late July - August, 2004 timeframe and is therefore included on this submission.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropylene: Approximately 950,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is the primary feedstock for both of the PO units.\n\n\n\nPropane: Approximately 75,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propane is a chemical used in the manufacture of PO.\n\n\n\nMethylamine (MA): Approximately 740,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  The Methylamine is stored in an aquesous solution that is approximately 40% MA and 60% water.  MA is a feedstock in the BDO unit.\n\n\n\nEthylene:  Approximately 70,000 lbs. are contained in a pipeline and is used as a primary feedstock for the production of Ethylbenzene in the two POSM units.\n\n\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 414,000 lbs. are contained in a surge drum in the MTBE unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Propylene Oxide (PO)\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for PO assumes the complete rupture of the largest PO storage tank at this facility, releasing 17,250,000 lbs. of liquid PO into a containment dike, and leading to a vapor cloud release.  Distance to the endpoint of this scenario was calculated using the EPA tables of 7.4 miles, and ultimately imp"

The total release would be approximately 163,000 lbs. of Propylene, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The over pressure would not be contained on-site, and would also have a direct impact on a Cogeneration Plant owned and operated by Dynegy within the battery-limits of this facility.

Addiitonally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards as well as is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage, with the overall thougth of identifying and mitigating HSE issues before installation or operation.  Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Certification Program: CVOS has a training and testing program that ensures that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.  Periodic operator re-certification is required.\n\n\n\nComputerized Process Simulation: Computerized simulation programs are used for training and troubleshooting and include emergency shutdown and start-up simulations.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Procedures: CVOS has specific procedures for maintaining process equiment so that it operates safely.

Design (DSRs) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted for facility or process changes prior to implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): Reviews conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities or processes are safe to operate.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: CVOS has a program to ensure that accidents, incidents, and near misses are properly investigated to determine the root cause as well as contributing causes.  In addition to the investigation, action items resulting from the investigation are communicated site-wide and tracked to completion to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: CVOS conducts audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions set forth under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.  These audits are conducted at a minimum of every three years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation: CVOS plant has a program to ensure that maintenance and operations personnel are involved in all prevention program elements.

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained, and uses the Houston Area Contractors Association as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility.  All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Contractors Association training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant.  In addition to basic training CVOS site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of substances regulated under the RMP rule at this facility over the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nCVOS maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, CVOS coordinates with the community response plan through the North Channel and Highlands LEPC, as well as the Harris County Office of Emergency Management.  CVOS is also a participating member of the Houston area Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA).\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe following is a list of improvements CVOS is planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\n\n\n* Continued review and upgrade of safety interlocks system.\n\n* Revalidate all PHAs in accordance with requirements under RMP and PSM.\n\n* Revise the emergency response plan after critiques from recent drills.\n\n* Update facility security with a Security and Vulnerability Survey.\n\n* Continue to utilize the tools of Root Cause Analysis to investigate incidents and develop effective solutions to prevent recurrence.\n\n"
