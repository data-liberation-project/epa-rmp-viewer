Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Western Farm Service's Roberts facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 272 North Bassett Road, Roberts, Idaho, 83444 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and propane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous Ammonia is also used in the production of aqua ammonia and ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received and stored in one 80-ton rail car and stored in one 12,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 188,530 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (upto 30% of ammonia by weight) is produced and stored at the site using an aqua ammonia convertor and stored in one 12,000-gallon above ground tank at the site. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 90,000 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 30% active ingredient by weight, is 27,000 pounds.  \n\nPropane gas is received by tanker truck and stored in one 5,000-gallon and one 1,400-gallon above ground tanks at the site.\n\n3.

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.65 miles.   The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) and  is a release of 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia from a broken 2-inch diameter pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\nB.  Aqua Ammonia Worst-Case Release Scenarios  \nThe first alternative release scenario is failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 90,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.32 miles.  The second alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a release of 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia solution from a storage tank modeled with an increased wind speed and \"D\" Stability modeling parameters.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.19 miles.\n\nC.  Propane Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios.  \nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would release 25,250 pounds of propane.  It is assumed that the entire tank contents are released as a vapor which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in a resulting explosion.    The distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 0.20 miles.  The alternative release scenario, based on the PHA scenarios (or the most likely potential incident) is a  pull-away failure of a 1-1/4-inch diameter pipe with a subsequent vapor cloud explosion. The distance to the endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.10 miles. \n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqu"

Have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property  damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia, aqua ammonia, and propane processes at the facility are listed in the Facility PHAs. In summary, planned changes address the review and development of Standard Operating Procedures for regulated onsite processes."
