All employees are held accountable for their own safety performance.\n\nAdditionally, employees understand that work is never so urgent or important that we cannot take time to do it safely and correctly. Two guiding principles at this Refinery are; Don't think it is safe, know it is safe and There's always time to do it right.\n\n\nChevron's Corporate Policy 530 - Protecting People and the Environment\n\nIt is the policy of Chevron Corporation to conduct its business in a socially responsible and ethical manner that protects the safety and health of people and the environment. The Chevron Refinery is committed to upholding this policy. The company's goal is to be the industry leader in safety and health performance, and to be recognized worldwide for environmental excellence.  This goal is achieved through designing, operating, and maintaining facilities to prevent injury, illness, and accidents.  Of equal importance in achieving this goal is open communication with the public regarding the possible impact of our business on them or the environment.

The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.   A final list of action items is reviewed with the Refinery Management Team and after concurrence, is distributed for follow-up.  This action item list is tracked to ensure that all follow-up items are completed in a timely manner.  Completed items are documented, and a copy of this document is placed in the PHA study manual.  PHAs are revalidated at least every five years.  The revalidation includes a review of the changes (design, regulatory, etc.) that have taken place in the process since the last PHA and includes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as with the initial PHA. \n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Refinery also has an active and comprehensive training program for all operations personnel that serves to build on the operating procedures mentioned above.  All new operations personnel must complete an initial five week training session before entering a plant for duty.  Once at the plant, new operations personnel attend a unit school and piggy-back with more experienced operators before taking on full responsibility for his or her duties.  Only after a new operator demonstrates the skills necessary to operate on his or her own are they allowed to work independently.  In addition, operations personnel receive refresher training on operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  All training is documented and kept on record in the Refinery's O&M Training Department.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Chevron Refinery uses contract personnel to supplement maintenance work and also during planned shutdowns and construction activities.

Training consists of the Refinery safety policy and rules, the emergency response plan, the drug and alcohol policy, process hazards and alarms and an overview of environmental requirements. Safety audits of contract personnel are conducted either independently by the contractor or jointly with a Chevron representative to ensure that safety standards are being met. \n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that a pre-startup safety review must be conducted on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nThe purpose of the pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is to insure that prior to startup, refinery equipment is reviewed to determine whether it is safe to operate, and meets all applicable requirements of Company standards, good engineering practices, industry codes and practices, and local, State, and Federal codes and statutes.  The  PSSR  consists of several independent reviews which include a Design, Construction and Standard Review, Safety in Design Review, Plant Protection Review, an Environmental review, an Operational Readiness Review, and a Process Hazard Analysis (for new construction). \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical Integrity includes all activities required to ensure proper design, construction, and ongoing integrity and reliability of equipment in order to prevent or minimize incidents for the life of the equipment.

Examples of these include but are not limited to: \n1) the control of the entry, presence, and exit of personnel into confined spaces or other hazardous work areas, \n2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of hazardous energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, \n3) procedures for the safe removal of substances that may be hazardous before equipment is opened for inspection and/or maintenance, \n4) a permit procedure to control activities that may be a source of ignition (i.e. hot work), and \n5) the controlled entry of personnel into plant areas.  \n\nThe Refinery safe work practices along with training of personnel who may be involved with these types of work form a system that aides in making sure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) is one element of the Refinery's Process Safety Management (PSM) system. The purpose of MOC is 1) to anticipate incidents that could be created by a change, as well as health and safety issues, and 2) to design the change in a way that reduces the likelihood of incidents.  Management of Change applies to all changes to Refinery equipment, processes, feeds, chemicals, procedures or technology.  \n\nThe MOC process involves as applicable a review of equipment design, construction, and siting, fire protection, e"

Public Officials from the Local Fire Department, Navy base and Singing River Hospital have been invited to participate or critique the drills.\n\nThe Refinery\u00bfs Fire fighting fleet is quite extensive and consists of a 95 ft aerial platform truck, one 2000 and one 3500 gpm foam pumper truck, a hazmat and rescue unit, and an ambulance. Additionally we have a portable 3000 gpm fire pump with large flow nozzles for situations where a truck pumper could not be used. We also keep on hand approximately 15,000 gallons of fire fighting foam. Fire fighting system upgrades or replacements are occurring and will continue to occur over the next five years for the Refinery fire water piping and main headers as well as for fixed fire water systems throughout the Refinery. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Refinery is coordinated with the Jackson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which has members from the local emergency response community, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nEarlier this year the refinery implemented a clarified system of individual and team accountability with regard to critical safety procedures. We clarified critical safe work procedures and have clearly demonstrated that disregard for these procedures will not be tolerated. \n\nWe continue to emphasize the use of observations and our Behavioral Safe processes with all of our employees. This year we initiated an ergonomic observation program specifically for computer users. \n\nContractor safety improvements are planned through improving the quality and consistency of Contractor training.

Process Safety Information includes but is not limited to safety instruction sheets, operating procedures, piping and instrumentation drawings, loop drawings and material safety data sheets.  Most of this information is available electronically for easy access.  Its purpose is to train and inform employees of the hazards, safety precautions, and design related limits for the units. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written operating procedures that address each Plant's operational processes including start-up, normal operations, emergency shutdown, planned shutdown, and the initial start-up of a new plant or after a planned maintenance shutdown.  These procedures are available to operations personnel and serve as a basis for training new operations personnel.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe primary technique used to perform these evaluations is known as Process Hazards Analysis.  A PHA study is a systematic review of existing or proposed new equipment Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) or significant modifications to existing P&IDs for possible deviations from the normal design intent.\n\nThe employer must use one or more of the following PHA methods, as appropriate, to determine and evaluate the hazards of the process being analyzed:\n-What if\n-What If/Checklist\n-Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP)\n-Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)\n-Fault tree analysis or\n-An appropriate equivalent"

      "SummaryText": "nery receives crude oil by tanker for processing into various products.  The process by which crude oil is manufactured into various saleable products (for example, gasoline, propane,  etc.) is known as refining.  Petroleum refining involves the separation of crude oil into several components using distillation methods.  Heavier hydrocarbon compounds are further processed by cracking and subsequent combining or rearranging.  Many of the refining processes include the formation, combining, or rearranging of regulated flammable substances. Regulated flammable substances are present at the Refinery as flammable mixtures. Primary components of the mixtures are propane, butane, pentane and propylene. Secondary components of the mixtures can include: hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, butene, isobutane, isobutene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, 1,3-butadiene, and isopentane. \n\nThe only RMP regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is an impurity in the crude and as the crude is distilled the ammonia is removed and sold as a product. \n\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe section is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Pascagoula Refinery.  Because processes at the Refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP (Risk Management Process) regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM (Process Safety Management) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. The objective of the PSM system is to reduce the consequences of and potential for accidents in the Refinery.  Accidents could include fires, explosions, toxic gas releases, spills, product quality problems, etc.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Refinery encourages participation in Process Safety Management through training and the development of cross-functional teams to perform process hazards analys"

Safety topic presentations are included as part of meeting agendas and responsibility for these presentations is rotated among employees to give everyone a chance to participate.  \n\nBehavioral Accident Prevention Process BAPP (BST) \n\nEmployee safety participation is built upon the Behavioral Accident Prevention Process (BAPP) developed by Behavioral Science Technology, Inc.  In this process, employees observe each other while performing their daily work for behaviors which might put them at risk for causing an accident.  The employee being observed receives immediate feedback during the observation regarding their performance.  The data from each observation is also collected on a checklist and input into a database.  The data is then used on group and refinery levels to develop action plans to improve behaviors, procedures, and equipment.  Each field employee receives initial and annual refresher training in this process.  Approximately 1000 observations are performed per month.  \n\nThis process is managed by organizational employee steering committees that also provide input on other refinery safety initiatives related to work process improvements and regulatory compliance issues.\n\nSafety Audits\n\nPeriodically the Refinery is subject to company internal audits.  These audits include Fire Loss Prevention surveys, Corporate Safety, Fire, and Health Compliance Reviews and Process Safety Management Audit.  These audits/surveys insure that the facility is in compliance with recommended practices, policies, and government laws and regulations.\n\nSafety Meetings\n\nSafety meetings are held on a routine basis throughout the Refinery and involve all employees as participants and/or presenters. All meetings start with a formal or informal safety minute.

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is released accidentally.  The plan includes procedures and information on all aspects of emergency response, including the incident command system (which is the organizational structure used during emergency response), fire fighting equipment and procedures, internal and external assistance and equipment resources, first aid and medical attention procedures, evacuation plans, and notification procedures for government agencies and community officials in the event of an offsite or reportable release. There are also procedures in place for the testing and maintenance of emergency response equipment and procedures for equipment operation.  \n\nThe Emergency Response Team (ERT) is highly trained and skilled. Team members have monthly training meetings and routinely attend offsite training for rescue skills, Hazmat response, foam application etc. Hypothetical drills are also conducted on a regular basis.  These drills create and sustain a high degree of accident response awareness by creating  what if situations which stimulate thinking and improve readiness of personnel to cope with a variety of emergency situations.  Hypothetical drills include plant drills and formal drills.  During a plant drill different operating situations that may be a potential fire problem are presented and the group goes through the motion of putting out the fire.  Other personnel in the Refinery may be asked to participate depending on the degree of the drill and apparatus required.  Formal drills are scheduled at least biannually and are on a larger scale. These drills include an outside Ambulance Service and participants treat this hypothetical drill situatio"

The change passes through several phases of review with an emphasis placed on the type of change and the impact of that change.  The MOC requests are tracked, and once all the required reviews are completed the MOC is given an authorization to implement change approval.  A copy of the signed MOC documentation form accompanies all copies of the work request for Operator and Mechanic review.  Completed MOC documentation is retained for a minimum of five years.  Training about the change is provided to affected personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation mandates that an incident investigation  must be conducted for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a release or fire  in the workplace. Since we are committed to preventing incidents and thereby protecting employees and our surrounding community we actually investigate more incidents than are required under the OSHA PSM law. We do this in an effort to understand and stop smaller problems from becoming larger problems which might lead to an incident. \n\nThe TapRooT Incident Investigation technique developed by System Improvements, Inc. is used on all major investigations. This investigation process helps identify the primary root cause(s) and may include interviewing involved personnel, as well as reviewing process and equipment data, applicable procedures, operating conditions and training records. The intent of an investigation is to learn why the incident happened and prevent a recurrence of it or similar incidents.
