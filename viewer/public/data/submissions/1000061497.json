      "SummaryText": "The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDuke Energy Progress, Inc., Mayo Electric Generating Plant is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Roxboro, North Carolina.  The plant uses anhydrous ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.  The SCR system is designed to inject ammonia gas into the plant flue gas and then pass the ammonia/flue gas mixture through a catalyst.  The catalyst causes a reaction that reduces NOx (pollutant) emissions in the flue gas, converting NOx into nitrogen gas and water.  The Mayo Plant stores the ammonia in two (2) 21,890 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.  The anhydrous ammonia in the storage tanks is liquefied under pressure.  The Plant uses administrative controls to limit the maximum volume of each tank to 18,600 gallons.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) addresses the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia used in the SCR system. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies and Programs\n\n\n\nThe Mayo Plant has established an Accidental Release Prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with the regulatory requirements of both OSHA (Process Safety Management, PSM, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA (Risk Management, RMP, 40 CFR 68).  In addition, responding to emergencies the Plant has an Emergency Action Plan that complies with a whole host of regulatory programs, including OSHA Emergency Response Planning requirements (29 CFR 1910.120(q).  These plans have been coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nAccident History and Recent Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThere have been no RMP accidents at the Mayo Plant.  An initial HAZOP and subsequent revalidation have been conducted.  Opportunities to improve process safety were identified and implemented.  The system is equipped with interlocks and excess flow valves.  Emergency shutdown procedures are in place.  The ammonia storage tanks are locat"

The station participates in table-top exercises with outside responding agencies. Mayo Station has Predictive Maintenance inspections and services in place to prevent hazards.  Mayo station has created a PSM steering team to review and enhance the site's PSM/RMP program, increase safety awareness and ensure better employee participation. Mayo Station and its employees strive to enhance the plant's safety performance."
