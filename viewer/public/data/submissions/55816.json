Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and employees of Western Farm Service, 21929 Lassen Road, Five Points, California are committed to the prevention of a release of Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqua Ammonia and pesticides.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  An emergency response plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides and agro-nomic services to growers and ranchers.  To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\nA. Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and pack-aged containers of agricultural chemicals and packaged seed.  All fertilizer, agricul-tural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers.  No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nB. Ten agricultural pesticides stored in the Chemical Warehouse are regulated sub-stances.  The maximum process quantities (in pounds of active ingredient) of the regulated substances stored in the Chemical Warehouse are:  Azinphos Methyl (36 pounds); Carbofuran (220 pounds); Dimethoate (715 pounds); Endosulfan (100 pounds); Fenamiphos (85 pounds); Methamidophos (1440 pounds); Oxamyl 120 pounds); Paraquat Dichloride (264 pounds); Phorate (792 pounds) and Phosmet (70 pounds).\n\nC. Anhydrous Ammonia is received and stored at the facility.  It is distributed to grow-ers for use as a plant nutrient.
