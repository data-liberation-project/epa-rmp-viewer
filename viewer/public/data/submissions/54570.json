      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n1.1\tSOURCE\r\nThe Unilever, Baltimore, Maryland margarine production facility is subject to the \r\nUSEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release \r\nregulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more \r\nthan the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS \r\nNumber 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas at ambient conditions.  \r\nThe anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the \r\nprocessing and storage temperature for margarine and related products.  It is a \r\nclosed system that contains ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and \r\nsaturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The \r\ncondensing towers, main ammonia receiver, make-up air units, and some piping \r\nruns are located outdoors.\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use \r\nthroughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable \r\npressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in \r\nlarge doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because \r\nammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a high \r\npressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing units (MPUs) \r\noperate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly chill product on scrape \r\nsurface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the MPUs at about 0 psig \r\npasses through the low accumulator before entering the booster compressors.  \r\nAny liquid ammonia in the low side suction is trapped in the low side \r\naccumulators and returned as high pressure liquid for the system.  The booster \r\ndischarge passes through an intercooler/high side suction before entering the \r\nhigh side compressors.\r\nThe high side compressor suction draws from"

      "SummaryText": "the intercooler/high side suction \r\naccumulator at about 30 psig (booster discharge).  This accumulator receives \r\nsuction from various cooler units.  Excess ammonia liquid that collects in the \r\nhigh side accumulator is removed and returned to the system.\r\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is transferred to \r\nfive condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for defrosting and \r\nfor operation of the pumper drums.\r\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to \r\nthe low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air \r\nhandlers.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific safety \r\nsystems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, and \r\nsystem safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the compressor discharge, \r\ncondensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, intercooler, and pump-out \r\nsystem from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include \r\nhigh pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \r\nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for \r\nthe compressors are set at 200 psig.\r\n2.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of \r\nammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release \r\nscenarios described in Sections 2 and 3, respectively, of the submitted RMP \r\nReport.  To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a \r\nprevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health \r\nAdministration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly \r\nHazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key \r\ncomponents of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n*\tThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical \r\nprocess safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design \r\nb"

A team with expertise in \r\nengineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing \r\nrefrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve \r\nthe safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process \r\nhazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls \r\napplicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility \r\nsiting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety \r\nand health effects of control system failures.
