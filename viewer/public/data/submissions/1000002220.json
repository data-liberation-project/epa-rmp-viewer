Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CHATTANOOGA FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilityA?s primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).  Chlorine is received into Chattanooga in 180,000 pound railcars.  The product is then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers.  Sulfur Dioxide is received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine & Sulfur Dioxide containers are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 1,080,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is present at our facility at 50,000 lbs.\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefl"
