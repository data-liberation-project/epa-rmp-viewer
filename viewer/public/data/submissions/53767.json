EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nClearwater Paper Corporation has prepared this Risk Management Plan to comply with federal Risk Management Program regulations contained in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe Clearwater Paper Corporation is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Clearwater Paper employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Idaho Pulp and Paperboard Division in Lewiston, Idaho, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Lewiston Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Potlatch\u00bfs Idaho Pulp and Paperboard Division.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Lewiston Mill.\n\nThe risk management program at the Lewiston Mill consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances) - see topics 1.3 and 1.6\n\n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n\n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes - see topic 1.7\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Clearwater Paper Corpor"

In fact, the Lewiston Mill has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nThe Lewiston Mill prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the mill, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nThe Lewiston Mill limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Clearwater Paper Corporation trains workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, the mill\u00bfs fire department works with the City of Lewiston fire department and with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management to help ensure that injuries and environmental damage will be minimized if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Lewiston Mill consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.  This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at Clearwater Paper Corporation that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nClearwater Paper Corporation is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The Lewiston Mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of process"

The mill provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire departments.  The Clearwater Paper Fire Department is staffed with certified firemen and is manned 24 hours per day.  Clearwater Paper has formed a mutual aid agreements with the City of Clarkston, Asotin County fire Protection District No. 1, City of Asotin, Washington State University, the City of Moscow and the City of Pullman.  Response activities have also been discussed with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Lewiston Mill established a management system headed by the Environmental Health and Safety Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\n1.2  Facility Information and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Idaho Pulp and Paperboard Division of Clearwater Paper Corporation operates an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 776 full-time workers.  The mill produces approximately 1,450 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates two coated paperboard machines.  The mill also supplies bleached kraft pulp to Clearwater Paper's Consumer Products Division, which manufactures tissue and towel products.  As part of this manufacturing process, Clearwater Paper Corporation handles several regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at the Lewiston Mill.\n\nRegulated Substances:\n\nProcess: Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer\nProgram Level: 3\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine Dioxide\nProcess Quantity: 36,350 lb\n\nProcess: Chlorine Un"

Beginning in 1992, the mill formalized this prevention program for both the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established similar requirements for Program 3 processes.  The principal elements of the Lewiston Mill\u00bfs Program 3 prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements are listed below:\n\n\u00bfMaintaining process safety information to document physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the mill and the design basis and safe operating parameters for equipment at the mill.\n\u00bfPerforming process hazard analyses to help identify potential process hazards and to generate recommendations to improve safe operations.\n\u00bfDefining safe operating procedures.\n\u00bfTraining of workers to safely and effectively perform assigned tasks.\n\u00bfInspecting and testing to assess equipment mechanical integrity.\n\u00bfManaging change to ensure that change does not negatively affect safe operations.\n\u00bfPerforming pre-startup safety reviews of new or modified processes.\n\u00bfConducting compliance audits to be certain that safety programs are effectively addressing safety issues.\n\u00bfInvestigating incidents so that similar accidents can be prevented.\n\u00bfParticipating of employees to help ensure that safety concerns of employees are addressed.\n\u00bfUsing hot work permits to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions.\n\u00bfManaging contractor activities to ensure their work is performed in a safe manner.\n\n1.4  Chemical-specific Prevention S"

Chlorine is supplied in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 90-ton rail cars.  Chlorine is unloaded in an enclosed building which vents to a caustic scrubber to reduce the likelihood of a release.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas containing chlorine.\n\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Lewiston Mill and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution.  Chlorine dioxide is produced in chlorine dioxide generators and piped to absorber columns, where a 1 weight percent chlorine dioxide solution is generated.  Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release.  A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n1.5  Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Lewiston Mill is proud of its safety record with respect to the use of chlorine and the generation, storage and use of chlorine dioxide.  No releases of chlorine occurring from the Lewiston Mill in the last five years have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off-site.  \n\nThe Lewiston Mill\u00bfs five year accident history includes three releases of chlorine dioxide that occurred on July 12, 2001, September 22, 2001 and August 19, 2005 resulting in OSHA Recordable Incidents. The July 12, 2001 incident involved one company employee. The September 22, 2001 incident involved two company employees and the August 19, 2005 involved two company employees.
