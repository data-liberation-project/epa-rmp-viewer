              "Description": "Even though these three chemicals are stored in different co-located tanks, they will be considered under the same prevention program, since their physical properties and safeguards are essentially the same.  Trimethylamine (TMA), Ethyl Chloride (EtCl) and Methyl Chloride (MeCl) are all liquefied compressed gasses stored in above ground tanks, each with its own containment.  There are written operating procedures with high-level alarms that prevent more than 80% of the designed capacity  to be stored in these tanks.  Each storage tank has two pressure relief valves (PRV), each valve having a rupture disk.  The PRV's are designed to relieve excess pressure below the designed pressure rating of the tanks; therefore, preventing a catastrophic failure of the tanks.  Annually, the PRV's are sent to a factory representative for testing and certification.  On each of the tanks, one of the PRV's is sent off at a time for testing then installed and the other PRV is sent off.  Each PRV has a rupture disk installed to protect the PRV from chemical attack and eliminate any leakage through the PRV.  Each of the storage tanks and associated piping has annual integrity checks, which includes tank thickness testing.  Daily leak checks of tanks and piping as well as daily inventory checks ensure that all the material is accounted for.  The TMA, MeCl, and EtCl are purchased from approved suppliers and use dedicated drivers and trailers for their transportation.  Only qualified SACHEM operating associates unload the chemicals to the storage tanks and to process vessels.  All SACHEM associates operate under the philosophy that safety, health and environmental stewardship is a precondition to anything that we do.  They work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor.",

We provide high purity chemicals and services worldwide to electronics, catalysts, and pharmaceutical markets and to most major chemical manufacturers.  The company was started in Austin in 1950, expanded to the current bulk production facility at Cleburne in 1990, a facility in Wuxi, China and acquired a facility in Zaltbommel, The Netherlands.  SACHEMs Mission Statement and Responsible Care&reg; Policy speaks to Safety, Health and Environmental stewardship being a precondition to anything that we do.  All associates operate under that philosophy.  We work hard every single day to be a safe, environmentally friendly neighbor and we are involved in many voluntary programs at the local, state and federal level.  We are proactive in various civic activities in Cleburne and are active members of the Johnson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The President of SACHEM has said many times \"There is not one pound of chemical worth making that jeopardizes safety, health, and the environment\". \n\nSACHEM, Inc. is an ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 certified facility and is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its production processes.  We are members the ACC (American Chemical Council).  As new members of ACC, SACHEM is required to implement the Responsible Care&reg; Codes of Management Practices and Guiding Principles, as we are currently working on our RC14001 certification. Some of the key Guiding Principles are:  1.) To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations, 2.) To make health, safety, security and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new products and processes, and 3.) To operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) is also part of SACHEM's daily op"

PSM includes the following components: process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, contractors, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, compliance audits, and trade secrets.  The hazards of the chemicals are found in the Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which SACHEM retains, for each chemical it has on site.  Operator training is a major undertaking at SACHEM.  Before a new operator is allowed to operate a process, he goes through extensive training.\n\n\n\nThere are operating associates on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year ensuring that the plant is operating in a safe manner.  Daily leak checks and inspections are performed on all process piping, reaction vessels and storage tanks.  All process equipment and storage vessels have safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutoff devices and relief valves and continuous computer monitoring to prevent problems.  There are yearly integrity inspections on vessels, piping and electrical equipment which includes storage vessel thickness inspections.  The pressure relief valves from storage vessels and process equipment are sent to the manufacturer for yearly inspection and testing.  SACHEM has participated in the voluntary OSHCON program for the last 21 years. \n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, SACHEM manufactures specialty chemicals and the chemicals that are on site above threshold quantities are methyl chloride, trimethylamine and ethyl chloride. Methyl chloride is on the toxic list, while trimethylamine and ethyl chloride are on the flammable list.  Methyl chloride and trimethylamine worst case scenarios impact off-site receptors using the OCA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.

      "SummaryText": "o (ARS), the storage tank was assumed to overpressure causing the pressure relief valve to vent the excess pressure.  The ARS for trimethylamine and methyl chloride impacted off-site receptors using the OCA Guidance Document and RMP Comp.  Trimethylamine and methyl chloride are liquefied compressed gasses and kept under pressure for storage at ambient temperature.  The pressure relief valves are installed to prevent the worst case scenario.  They are designed to relieve the pressure prior to tank failure.  Other systems in place to manage the risk include daily visual inspection of the storage tanks, daily raw material inventory, contractor safety training, preventive maintenance program, and incident investigations on all near misses.\n\nThe five-year accident history shows that there have been no RMP reportable accidents in the 24 years SACHEM has been in Cleburne.  This means there have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or property damage and no off-site deaths, hospitalizations, medical treatment, evacuation, sheltering-in-place, property damage and environmental damage, which includes fish or animal kills, tree, lawn, shrub, or crop damage, water contamination, or soil contamination.\n\nSACHEM's Emergency Response Program was developed with input from the Cleburne Fire Department, local LEPC, and Cleburne Emergency Management officials.  If an emergency occurs, a plant wide alarm is sounded with instructions given over the intercom system.  The emergency phone number, 911, is called to inform the City of Cleburne of our needs and the type of emergency present.  If an evacuation is necessary, all associates, including contractors are gathered and roll call is taken to ensure everyone that was in the plant made it safely to the rally point.  The incident command system takes over from there.  In using this system, all the emergency groups are communicating effectively. The emergency is assessed and additional response equipment and associates are called, if required."

We test the emergency alarm system weekly and have quarterly drills.
