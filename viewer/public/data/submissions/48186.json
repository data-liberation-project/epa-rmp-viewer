Pioneer is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.  Pioneer also participates in the Canadian Chemical Producers\u00bf Association Responsible Care\u00ae initiative.  Responsible Care\u00ae is the industry\u00bfs effort to reach out and dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety programs and to receive input from the community on issues of concern.\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic) and repackages chlorine into one-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  The site also distributes sulfur dioxide.  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Pioneer\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nThe site also produces fabric softeners and household ammonia.  None of the chemicals used in this manufacturing appears on site at a level such that they fall under the Risk Management Program (\u00bfRMP\u00bf) rule.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Pioneer Tacoma Bleach facility.\n\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and repackaged into one-ton containers and 150-pound cylinders.  It is also used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use both chlorine and bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water t"

No repackaging takes place.  Sulfur dioxide is also used in water treatment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the Federal RMP Prevention Program and OSHA Process Safety Management (\u00bfPSM\u00bf) requirements.  We have physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAn accident involving a release of chlorine that resulted in no injuries occurred on February 12 2007.  An operator accidently disconnected the yolk on a 1-ton container while it was still connected and in the fill mode.  The operator had failed to shut off fill valves and purge the lines.  Approximately 894 lbs of chlorine was released which required outside emergency response assistance.\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPioneer has a comprehensive emergency response program that includes detection, alarm, shutdown, containment and scrubbing systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Pioneer has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Pioneer has worked closely with the Tacoma Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (\u00bfLEPC\u00bf) in developing its Emergency Response Plan.  Pioneer has also been working closely with Pierce County Emergency Management in their development of the Threat Response System designed to provide detailed site information"

Future plans for improved safety include emergency shut-off controls for container and cylinders."
