Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  7200 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 7200 pounds pounds of ammonia will have a distance of (1 MILE) before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario i. - The shearing-off of the cylinder valve or vapor line resulting in a 10 lb per minute release  of Chlorine for 60 minutes.  The distance to endpoint from EPA guidance is (insert distance).  This facility has never experienced a release of this type. (insert info on hazmat team)"
