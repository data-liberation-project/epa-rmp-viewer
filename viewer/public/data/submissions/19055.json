      "SummaryText": "Lake Mackenzie Municipal Water Authority supplies water to four towns and the lake is used for recreation. There is a housing area on the lake with some permenent residents--most of the housing is used on weekends.  Chlorine is the only hazard material used at the water treatment plant.  Storage of the chlorine is in a sparsely populated area. There is one home located about 1200 feet from the storage tanks, and with prevailing winds blowing from southwest to northeast about 95% of the time, this home  and the housing area are in a very low risk area.   With southwest prevailing winds, chlorine would be carried over the lake and this will help dissinpate chlorine gases if a leakage should occur.  The other safety feature is there are many deep canyons located in and around the chlorine storage area.  If there should be a leak from the chlorine storage tanks all the Mackenzie Lake employees on duty are instructed to stay inside the office building and notify local emergency teams for assitance to reduce possibly health hazards.  This would include local law enforcement, Texas Highway Patrol, and Rural Fire Departments.  Safety procedures include blocking highway 207 that runs north and south from highway 287 north to farm to market 146 until all chlorine gases have dissipated.   The local game wardens will also be contacted to assist  with emergency response team.   The phone alert system will be activated for permanent and weekend residents living in the housing area.  Campers and people fishing on the lake will be contacted and directed to a safe area.  The Lake Mackenzie manager is agressively seeking training programs that will expand their chlorine safety program.  Response check lists will be developed to insure all safety measures will be followed.  Planned changes to improve safety include monthly safety programs, alert rosters, daily inspections of the chemical storage area by employees.  Once each month the manager and water superintendent will inspect the "
