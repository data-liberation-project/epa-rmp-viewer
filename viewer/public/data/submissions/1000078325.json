Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of data from the 2010 US Census Bureau in MARPLOT mapping system software.\r\n\r\n- General Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nSchwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \r\n\r\n- Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. has not experienced any accidental releases of ammonia that resulted in on site or off site impacts, or that required reporting.  \r\n \r\n\r\n- Emergency Action/Response Plan\r\n\r\nSchwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc.  current Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation and response of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.  Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. works closely with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and Deer Park Fire Department and HazMat team on emergency preparedness.  The written plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\r\n\r\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\n\r\nSchwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. continuously looks for ways to improve the safety and efficiency of the system. The processes will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing solutions. The Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration processes."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSchwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. - Deer Park, TX, facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Deer Park Fire Department and the Harris County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Schwan's Food Manufacturing, Inc. is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\r\n\r\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Sections 2 and 3 of the RMP*eSubmit document.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate both the worst case, and alternative release off site consequence analysis, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. As specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documente"
