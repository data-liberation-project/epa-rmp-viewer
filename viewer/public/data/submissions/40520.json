The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.

A Risk Management Program that includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system is maintained onsite.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room of the fixed system for shutting down the equipment.

The emergency coordinator is responsible for contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.  The coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if offsite evacuations are required.\n\nThe facility has implemented the State and County mandated emergency response plan (AKA Business Response Plan).

Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at all T&A facilities.  The same management and maintenance personnel are responsible for maintaining the ammonia refrigeration equipment to prevent accidents, and for responding to an emergency.  The written Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nThere are both portable and fixed refrigeration systems onsite and all have safeties to detect unsafe operating conditions.  The fixed system supports the main cold storage facility and has an ammonia detection system tied into an alarm system that is monitored 24 hours per day.  The portable systems have no detection since the units are outdoors.  Operators are present to monitor these units when they are running.  There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Stand Operating Procedures) and the maintenance program.\n\nDescription of Source and Substance Handled\n\nAt the Cantua Creek facility, ammonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage and produce precooling.  A fixed system is attached to the cold storage building and is used for cold storage and pressure cooling.  It also supports one vacuum tube used for product precooling.  The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer mounted and supports additional vacuum tubes for produce precooling.  The fixed refrigeration system was started in October, 1999.  Portable units vary in age but are well maintained and in good condition.  The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 30,500 LBS. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and "
