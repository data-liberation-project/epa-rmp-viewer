      "SummaryText": "Kinder Morgan Texas Terminals L.P. (Kinder Morgan) \u0096 Deer Park Ethanol & Rail is a rail car offloading and storage facility located in Pasadena, Texas, just west of the city limits of Deer Park, Texas. Deer Park Ethanol & Rail includes long stretches of rail track and multiple spurs to support the short-term storage of rail cars. The primary operation conducted is the storage and transfer of ethanol. Ethanol is offloaded from rail cars, stored onsite in two (2) above-ground atmospheric tanks, and distributed from the Facility through pipeline. In addition to ethanol, the Facility also utilizes its track space to store other products including isoprene and propylene mixtures (propylene, propane, and comparatively small amounts of ethylene). Rail cars containing those products are not offloaded or connected to Facility piping and infrastructure, only temporarily stored. Track space is available to store a maximum of 100 isoprene rail cars and 300 propylene mixture rail cars. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) specifically covers the Isoprene and Propylene Mixture Rail car Storage Process at the Facility. The Isoprene and Propylene Mixture Rail car Storage Process has been identified as RMP Program Level 2.\n\nDeer Park Ethanol & Rail shares its property with the Kinder Morgan Deepwater Terminal, a Terminal primarily involved in the transport of solids including coal and coke. While they share the same property and owner and use the same rail tracks, they are separate legal entities and this RMP does not apply to Kinder Morgan Deepwater Terminal.\n\nKinder Morgan has developed a written emergency response program and coordinates response activities with the local responders annually at minimum. If an emergency involving the butane process were to occur, it is Kinder Morgan's policy to notify the Kinder Morgan Central Terminals Emergency Response Team as well as other local response organizations including Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) and the Southeast Regional Local E"

Additionally, the Kinder Morgan Central Terminals Emergency Response Team and other local response agencies are contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills.\n\nRegarding Items 8.7b and 8.7c of this submission, Kinder Morgan is not responsible for any maintenance activities for this process that only involves the storage or rail cars containing flammables. All rail car maintenance is completed by the owner/issuer/shipper of that rail car under USDOT requirements. As the above-mentioned Items are required fields needed in order for the system to accept the submission, the value of 8.7a was included in 8.7b, though it is not applicable."
