The San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant is broken into two sub-facilities designated as the East and West Facility.\n\nThe San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant East (SJCWRP East) is located at 1965 Workman Mill Road in Whittier, California 90601.  The SJCWRP East facility stores a maximum of 72,000-pounds of chlorine at any one time (contained in two 25-ton bulk storage containers located indoors), a maximum of 68,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide at any one time (contained in two 20-ton bulk storage containers located indoors), and a maximum of 130,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) at any one time (contained in three 6,180 gallon above-ground tanks located outdoors).   \n\nThe San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant West (SJCWRP West) is located at 1971 Workman Mill Road in Whittier, California 90601.  The SJCWRP West facility stores a maximum of 72,000-pounds of chlorine at any one time (contained in two 25-ton bulk storage containers located indoors), a maximum of 68,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide at any one time (contained in two 20-ton bulk storage containers located indoors), and a maximum of 85,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) at any one time (contained in two 6,180 gallon above-ground tanks located outdoors).   \n\nDue to the quantities of chlorine, sulfur dioxide and aqueous ammonia stored, handled and used at the site, SJCWRP is subject to requirements specified in the federal Risk Management Plan regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68), the California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations (California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Articles 1 through 11) and the federal Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s Process Safety Management regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.119"

      "SummaryText": ").  \n\nGeneral Facility Information \n\nThe primary operation conducted at the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant is the treatment of wastewater (NAICS Code 22132 A? Sewage Treatment Facilities).  \n\nThe San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant (SJWRP) is located on two sites as follows:\n\nA?    San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant A? East\n    1965 Workman Mill Road\n    Whittier, California 90601.  \n\nA?    San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant A? West\n    1971 Workman Mill Road\n    Whittier, California 90601.  \n\nThe treatment facilities are located on a land area of approximately 39 acres, bounded on the southwest by the Pomona (60) Freeway, on the southeast side by Workman Mill Road, on the northeast side by the San Jose Creek Channel, and on the northwest side by the San Gabriel River.  \n\nCSDLAC has operated the SJCWRP facility since inception in 1971.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages, from an original capacity of 37.5 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to the current capacity of 100 mgd.  The wastewater treated at SJCWRP originates mainly from approximately 1,000,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with aqueous ammonia addition, chlorination, and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent that is suitable for re-use.  Aqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) is used in the disinfection process.  \n\nRMP Executive Summary Components\n\nStoring and handling large quantities of aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, SJCWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  SJCWRPA?s aqueous ammonia handling processes are subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Level 2 Requirements.  SJCWRPA?s chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agenc"

These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \nA?    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nA?    General facility and regulated substances information.\nA?    Offsite consequence analysis results. \nA?

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPAA?s Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe CSDLAC emergency response policy involves the preparation of Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCP) for handling hazardous materials which are specific for each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the SJCWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including aqueous ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning"

The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency (County of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The SJCWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nRegulated Substance Information\n\nAqueous ammonia (19.5 percent concentration) is used to maintain the disinfection limits in the treated effluent.  The aqueous ammonia is provided by delivery truck and transferred via hose to the ammonia storage tanks. Throughout the documentation, aqueous ammonia is referred to as being stored in storage tanks; the aqueous ammonia solution is actually stored in 30 psig design, ASME Code unfired pressure vessels.  There are three 6,180 gallon tanks at the SJCWRP-East Station and two 6,180 gallon tanks at the SJCWRP-West Station.  The working capacity of each tank is 5,120 gallons, and each tank is provided with a high level alarm.  The aqueous ammonia is then transferred from the storage tanks to dosing locations within the effluent channel and mixed.  Once the aqueous ammonia is mixed with the treated effluent, CalARP regulations no longer apply.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination at the East and West plants is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to bulk storage tanks located inside the buildings.  Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also received at the East and West plants in sulfur dioxide trailers and transferred to storage tanks located inside the buildings.  The chlorination system at both plants consists of two chlorine bulk storage tanks, evaporators, chlorinators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each chlorine bulk storage tank is 25 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in a tank at any given time is only 18 tons.  In case of a major chlorine leak, the bulk storage tanks and the chlorine tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff"

There are emergency shutdown switches (push buttons) located at each door into the chlorine building, and on the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel located on the mezzanine of the chlorine transfer area.  On the chlorine shutdown (emergency) valve control panel, there are individual control switches for each valve.  All emergency shutdown valves can also be activated from the Plant Control Room. \n\nChlorine gas detectors are used to detect a chlorine leak in the bulk storage and chlorinator rooms.  Upon detection of approximately 0.5 ppmv chlorine, the detectors will send a signal which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the chlorine gas within the chlorination and storage rooms.  The caustic scrubber system is automatically activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system at both plants consists of two sulfur dioxide bulk storage tanks, evaporators, sulfonators, residual analyzers, ejectors, diffusers, and piping and other equipment.  The capacity of each sulfur dioxide bulk storage tank is 20 tons; however, the maximum quantity of sulfur dioxide present in a tank at any given time is only 17 tons. In case of a major sulfur dioxide leak, the bulk storage tanks and the sulfur dioxide tank trailer can be isolated by the emergency shutoff valves located on the piping downstream of the bulk storage tank manway.  In addition, emergency shutoff valves are located at the end of each of the flexible hoses that connect to the tank trailer at SJCWRP-East, and at the end of the sulfur dioxide gas and airpad flexible hoses at SJCWRP-West.  Installation of another emergency shutoff valve, located at the end of the sulfur dioxide liquid hose that connects to the tank trailer at SJCWRP-West, was completed by August 1999.  Similar to the chlorine system, there are emergency shutdown "

Upon detection of approximately 5 ppmv sulfur dioxide, the detectors will send a signal, which will shut down the normal ventilation system to contain the gas within the sulfonator and storage room.  The caustic scrubber system is automatically activated in the event of a sulfur dioxide leak.\n\nThe scrubber systems at both plants are equipped with emergency generator sets.  The emergency generator will automatically start powering in the event of a power failure and will continue to run for 5 minutes after regular power is restored.  The emergency generator powers the entire scrubbing system including, local alarms, the scrubber fan (SJCWRP-East only), caustic recirculation pumps, electrically-operated valves and the sump pump.  The generator also powers portions of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems including the automatic shutoff valve system (including the air compressors), lighting in both areas as well as lighting in the scrubber area, gas detectors, and the building ventilation fans. \n\nThe SJCWRP-East is manned 24 hours a day, year round.  Access to the plant is through gates which are closed after regular hours.  The SJCWRP-West is manned 8 hours per day, and during the other 16 hours per day, alarms are answered by the SJCWRP-East operators.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of both \"worst-case release scenarios\" and \"alternative release scenarios\" as mandated by the regulations.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.

For the worst-case release scenario analysis for the SJCWRP, the following scenarios were considered: (1) rupture of one aqueous ammonia storage tank with a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons at SJCWRP-East, (2) rupture of one aqueous ammonia tank with a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons at SJCWRP-West, (3) rupture of one chlorine tank with a maximum capacity of 18-tons, resulting in a release of 36,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration, at SJCWRP-East, (4) rupture of one chlorine tank with a maximum capacity of 18-tons, resulting in a release of 36,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration, at SJCWRP-West, (5) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with a maximum capacity of 17-tons, resulting in a release of 34,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a 10-minute duration, at SJCWRP-East, and (6) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with a maximum capacity of 17-tons, resulting in a release of 34,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide over a 10-minute duration, at SJCWRP-West.\n\nThe aqueous ammonia tanks are located within a diked area.  The diked area for SJCWRP-East is 585.2 ft2 and for SJCWRP-West it is 635.47 ft2.  Hence, the release rates for aqueous ammonia at SJCWRP-East/West were calculated to be 1518.0 pounds per hour and 1638.0 pounds per hour, respectively.\n\nAdministrative controls are used to limit the filling of the chlorine bulk tank to only 18-tons and sulfur dioxide tank to 17-tons. The release rate reduction from the enclosed building is estimated to be approximately 82% of the release rate from the bulk tank, per guidance from EPA regarding control efficiencies levels for buildings storing chlorine and sulfur dioxide.

Operators from SJCWRP-East respond to accidental releases at SJCWRP-West when operators are not present after hours at the West plant.  Depending on the severity of the accidental release, external resources such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department will be called upon to aid in handling an aqueous ammonia, chlorine, or sulfur dioxide release.  As part of the emergency response program, the CSDLAC have developed and implemented Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Consolidated Contingency Plans (HMHWCCPs) for SJCWRP-East and SJCWRP-West for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment.  The HMHWCCPs have been coordinated with the local response agency (Los Angeles County Fire Department).  The main elements of each emergency response plan are: (1) initial discovery equipment and procedure, (2) response to an emergency, including procedures for immediate action and internal notifications, (3) procedures for external notifications, including coordination with Local Governments, Incident Commanders, (4) incident action plan, including mitigation actions, response resources, (5) implementation of tactical plan, and (6) termination and follow-up actions.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn 1990, as part of its compliance with the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), numerous change"

The released gas/liquid (i.e., either chlorine or sulfur dioxide) is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of either chlorine/sulfur dioxide vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) that disperse in the atmosphere.  Ammonia vapor from an evaporating pool does not form a denser-than-air cloud.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for aqueous ammonia was estimated using an average of results obtained from the SLAB and ALOHA dispersion analysis models and EPAA?s Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP for aqueous ammonia is 200 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is also the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (111 deg F), and average relative humidity (64%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion analysis indicated that the toxic endpoint distance would be 2.7-miles for sulfur dioxide, 2.6 miles for chlorine and 0.11 miles for aqueous ammonia.  \n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.

Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios must consider the facility accident history and/or failure scenarios identified in the process hazard analysis.  A review of the past five-year accident history data for the aqueous ammonia, chlorination, and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no aqueous ammonia, chlorine, or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the SJCWRP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite.  Thus, an acceptable/credible alternative release scenario had to be selected based on expert judgment.  The following alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis: \n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the SJCWRP ammonia system involves the transfer of the ammonia from the delivery truck to the tank.  A breach in the 20 foot transfer hose with an inside diameter of 2 inches is used as the alternative release.  In addition, the delivery truck operator or supervising facility personnel is assumed to have a reaction time of 60 seconds, at which point the emergency shut-off switch will be activated to stop the aqueous ammonia release.  Hence, the amount of aqueous ammonia released is equal to the volume of the hose as well as the amount released during the operatorA?s reaction time.  The amount released during the operatorsA? reaction time is equal to 60 seconds multiplied by the fill transfer pump flow rate of 100 gpm.

These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the storage tanks.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination facility.  It is assumed that a maximum of sixty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remotely-controlled shutoff valves installed on the flex hoses.\n\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 87 lb/min.  However, the chlorine release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.003 lb/min. The sulfur dioxide release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 56 lb/min.  However, the sulfur dioxide release rate to the atmosphere from the scrubber would be only 0.01 lb/min.  Since the chlorine and sulfur dioxide release from the scrubber stacks would be neutrally buoyant, EPAA?s SCREEN3 model was used for the air dispersion analysis.  \n\nThe meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 64 deg F, and average humidity of 64%.
