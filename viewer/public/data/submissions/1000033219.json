Thermo No. 1 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intermountain Renewable Power, LLC (Intermountain Renewable Power).  Additional process components at Thermo No. 1 include a wet cooling tower, one evaporation pond, and remote geothermal brine production and injection wells.  Auxiliary and operational support equipment and materials are also in use at the site.  \r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan was prepared in accordance with the requirements of Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (Rule) and covers operation of applicable power generation equipment and remote groundwater extraction and reinjection wells at Thermo No. 1.  The goal of a Risk Management Plan (Plan) is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that may occur. \r\n\r\nThis Plan is comprised of five chapters including this introduction.  Chapters 2 through 4 include a discussion of requirements for registration of the Plan with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Plan certification, and an offsite hazard assessment, respectively.  Chapter 5 discusses other Plan requirements.  Appendices are attached at the end of the Plan.\r\n\r\n1.2 SITE DESCRIPTION \r\n\r\nThermo No. 1 is situated in the remote desert region of Utah approximately 15 miles west of the town of Minersville Town and approximately 1 mile north of the Beaver County/Iron County line (see Figure 1).  The entire site consists of approximately 1,120 acres of land with geothermal power generating equipment occupying just 68 developed acres of land.  The elevation of the power-generation facility is approximately 5,070 feet above mean sea level.  Topography at the site slopes gent"

Thermo Hot Springs are located approximately 1.0 mile northwest of the facility in the center of the valley between the Black and Shauntie Mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n1.3 APPLICABILITY\r\n\r\nThermo No. 1 is currently in the planning, design, and construction stages of adding more efficient power generation equipment to the facility, including a process unit that consists of a vaporizer, pre-heater, and condenser that will hold a maximum of 16,500 gallons of isopentane to be used as a motive fluid for driving the turbines.  Hereafter, this unit will be referred to as the Level 2 process unit.  Thermo No. 1 is eligible for Program 1 requirements under part 68.10(b) of the Rule, as indicated below:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\t Since utilization of isopentane at Thermo No. 1 is pending and no other threshold quantities of substances covered by the Rule have been or are currently utilized at the site, there has been no accidental release of substances covered by the Rule, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving regulated substance that led to death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor;\r\n\u00bf\tThe distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor (see Chapter 4); and\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency response procedures will be coordinated between Thermo No. 1 and local emergency planning and response organizations (see Section 5.1).\r\n\r\nThis Plan certifies that no additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases (see Chapter 3).\r\n\r\nThis Plan is written to cover the largest quantity of isopentane that will be used at the site, namely, 16,500 gallons in the Level 2 process unit.  Once the isopentane is delivered to the facility, it will be the only process-related substance at the facility that is regulated under the Rule.  Thermo No. 1 is covered under the rule because it anti"
