Health, safety and environmental compliance are a\n\nfundamental part of every employee's job. It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State\n\nand local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous\n\nammonia. If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its\n\nEmergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency\n\nPlanning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the\n\nimpact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at this facility (the\n\nstationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers. Anhydrous\n\nammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and\n\nlocal codes and regulations. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the facility's\n\nrelease prevention program.\n\n\n\n1) Safety Information: The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable\n\nFederal and State regulations. All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically\n\nreviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes. Safety Data Sheets, equipment\n\nspecifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia\n\nequipment are maintained at the facility.\n\n\n\n2) Hazard Review: Facility management conducts reviews of the hazar"

The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment\n\nmalfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control\n\nhazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases. The results of the\n\nreviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures: The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and\n\nstorage of anhydrous ammonia. The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety\n\nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\". The written\n\nprocedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n\n\n4) Training: All employees at the facility that handle anhydrous ammonia participate in a training\n\nprogram. Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading\n\nsafety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a written test) and onthe-\n\njob supervision. Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3)\n\nyears. The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as\n\nnecessary.\n\n\n\n5) Maintenance: The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.\n\nStorage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate\n\nannual basis and are documented. Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions\n\nfurnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA\n\nstandard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\") or industry codes (i.e.,\n\nthe provisions of the ANSI s"

The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a\n\nregular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n\n\n6) Compliance Audits: As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least\n\nonce every three (3) years. The audit will be documented and conducted by a person knowledgeable\n\nin the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. Corrective actions required as a result of\n\neach compliance audit will be performed promptly and documented.\n\n\n\n7) Incident Investigation: Facility management will investigate each incident that results in, or could\n\nhave reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia. The investigation will be\n\nperformed to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent the\n\nrelease from reoccurring. Investigation reports will be retained for five years.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the\n\npast five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to\n\nour knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage\n\nor environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local\n\nfire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility employees will not respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia except for those\n\nthat are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the\n\nimmediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or\n\nhealth hazard. This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other\n\nemergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency\n\nresponders when there is"
