This facility complies with OSHA 1910.111 standard requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. If an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Berkey Fire Department and request that they respond. We are prepared to work with the Berkey Fire Dept., or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances:\r\n  This facility is a branch location of Luckey Farmers, Inc. We are a farmer-owned cooperative serving our member-customers by providing goods and services to assist them in producing agricultural products. One such product sold to producers is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a crop production nutrient. The primary function of this facility is storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. On site are 4 12,000 gallon storage tanks containing a maximum capacity of 200,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and associated delivery tank-wagons and application equipment.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Scenario:\r\nNot Applicable - EPA removed this requirement due to security concerns.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario:\r\n  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely incident is a break in a transfer hose from the storage tank to a delivery tank-wagon. In this scenario, 2,901 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released, resulting in an impact zone endpoint distance of .31 mile. Within this impact zone are private dwellings and small businesses with a population of approximately 250 people.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program:\r\n  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\" published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Heal"

Employees are given proper training and the facility is on a regular inspection schedule.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n  We have not had an accident involving a release of anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n  This facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.138. We have provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency and employee training is in place. In the event an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Berkey Department and request that they respond. We have discussed this with the fire department and a member of the fire department has inspected this facility.\r\n\r\nPlanned Safety Changes:\r\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process. Periodic evaluations are performed to review the preservation of safe conditions. Corrective actions are made if the evaluations warrant it. There are no additional anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
