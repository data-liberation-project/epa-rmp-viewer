Outside contractors are on call to make any repairs needed to the ammonia system.  Any response requiring entry into a dangerous atmosphere or situation will be performed by the Linn County Fire Department. Ammonia response procedures are discussed during the annual inspection by the fire department. A copy of the LaCygne Station's modified Emergency Action Plan is included.  Employees are provided emergency response awareness training annually.\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nEvergy is committed to continually improve the RMP Program and safety systems. The LaCygne Generating Station has an effort in place to improve the facility\u0092s program documentation for the ammonia processes to ensure an overall robust and successful program.\n\nEvergy has completed this report to provide the public with information about our activities at this facility.

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nEvergy promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nEvergy believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Evergy employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nEvergy has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process.\n\nContractors [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nEvergy hires contractors to conduct specialty maintenance activities.

Valves that are relied upon to respond to an ammonia release were identified as shown on the system engineering diagrams. Comments and recommendations are summarized in the Process Hazard Analysis section of the Risk Management Program and are resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Evergy maintains detailed written operating procedures. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of both ammonia storage systems are in place. The SOPs are posted in appropriate areas. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nPersonnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nThe ammonia system is visually inspected on a regular basis. The LayCygne Generating Station has established operation, maintenance and inspection procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system. There are Operation and Maintenance manuals for each major piece of equipment, and personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the systems. The tank is located outdoors which will better ventilate the areas.  \n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Evergy to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

Engineered controls, such as automatic shut-off valves, check valves, relief valves and water misting system can be considered in the analysis.\n\nThe type of system failure identified for the alternative release was a loss of ammonia caused by a major leak in the liquid piping network between the tank and the vaporizer. As a conservative estimate, the rate of release was assumed to be the maximum flow that would not cause the ammonia storage tank liquid excess flow valves to automatically shut. The leak was assumed to continue until the ammonia odor would alert an operator or plant security personnel. The main isolation valve would be closed manually if it is safe to do so. If the ammonia vapor concentration is unsafe for facility response, the Linn County Fire Department will be called to respond to the emergency. The estimated time for leak detection and complete response for the Fire Department in the alternate release scenario is 30 minutes.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nEvergy has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nEvergy LayCygne maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the ammonia processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nThe most recent process hazard analysis was performed using a What If and Checklist type analysis for the ammonia system.

The facility is situated east of Interstate I-69 on the bank of the LaCygne Lake. The around the LaCygne Generating Station is rural and not occupied by other industrial entities. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the LaCygne Generating Station as an air pollution control additive, to reduce the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to the atmosphere from the unit boilers. Each boiler unit is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nEvergy LaCygne Generating Station maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity is 10,000 pounds. Evergy stores the chemical in four (4) 60,000-gallon  tanks, each limited to 85% fill, resulting in a total of 1,100,000 pounds onsite. The storage and management of anhydrous ammonia for both systems is addressed in this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario for ammonia was calculated as the loss of one 60,000-gallon (263,270 pounds) tank in accordance with the definition provided in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance for RMP development. The ammonia would be released as a gas. As required by the rule, only administrative control systems such as the company policy to fill the tanks to a maximum of 85% liquid by volume, were taken into consideration. The conditions of the scenario, such as release time and weather status are those specified in the EPA Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nThis type of rapid release would occur only if the ammonia tanks were breached.
