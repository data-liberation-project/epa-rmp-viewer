Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  The Waha Gas Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.

This information addresses the physical properties of hazardous substances handled, operating parameters of the equipment, and design basis and configuration of the equipment.  Energy Transfer ensures that this process safety information is available to all Energy Transfer employees, the LEPC, and the fire department.  \r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.

A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant has well-established programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks).\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) a review of the process hazards, and (3) the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOUCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer operates the Waha Gas Plant located in Pecos County, Texas.  The Waha Gas Plant uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas.   As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances (methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane) are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.  The Waha Gas Plant does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels.\r\n\t\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant has had no accidental release during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.  \r\n\r\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68,12(b)(3).  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Waha Gas Plant.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer and the Waha Gas Plant actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate i"

      "SummaryText": "ight be affected by process changes are informed of and trained in the change prior to process start-up.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  This investigation is lead by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process.  The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. \r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\r\nThe Waha Gas Plant retains a written site specific formal emergency response plan which includes the designated actions the company and all personnel will take to ensure personal safety from fire and other emergencies.  The plan outlines actions that company technicians and contract employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals.  The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Waha Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team includes those knowledgeable in the process, operations personnel, and at least one person trained in audit techniques and"
