Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n \n Ducor Cold Storage (\"DCS\") accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices. It is the policy of Ducor Cold Storage to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local environmental and safety laws and regulations.\n \n DCS emergency release policy involves the preparation of a response plan and training of employees in evacuation and appropriate response to releases of ammonia.\n \nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n \n DCS is located at Divizich and Carlisle Street, in the town of Ducor, Tulare County, California.  DCS is a cold storage facility and utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant. Ammonia is the only regulated substance at DCS in quantities over the threshold limit. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system at DCS is 53,500 pounds.\n \nC. Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n \n EPA guidelines for determining the worst-case release scenario were applied.  The worst case release scenario asumed the release of ammonia from the single largest vessel (receiver) as a gas over 10 minutes. Dispersion analysis was conducted using the public domain code DEGASIS. The distance to EPA  end-point for the worst case release scenario at DCS was off-site.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is unlikely because the company has employed the following control and mitigation measures.\n\nIndustry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of the equipment at its manufacture.\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to codes and good practices at the time of the installation and when upgrades were completed.\nPressure safety valves limit the operating pressures in the receiver.\nThe facility utilizes a preventive maintenance program to maintain the on-going integrity of the vessel\nThe facility has a training program that insures that only qualified personnel operate the"

Low level controls, high level controls and sensors for ammonia monitoring would act as active mitigation before the event reaches the levels that would bring about the above scenario.\n \n Alternative releases were also considered.  A release resulting from failure of the sight glass on the ammonia receiver was the alternative scenario that could have the greatest impact outside of BCS. The release will be as a flashing liquid or a \"two-phase flow\". The release rate was calculated using methodology due to Fauske and Epstein, and was modeled as a ground level release for a 10 minute duration.  Dispersion modeling was done using DEGASIS. The distance to the end-point for this scenario was determined to be off-site.\n \nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nDCS accident release prevention program is based in the following key elements: \n\n7 written operating procedures \n7 training of personnel\n7 preventative maintenance programs \n7 written safety procedures and safety equipment\n\nDCS prevention program is in accordance with  OSHA's process safety management PSM rules.\n\nDCS complies with:\n\n7 Applicable California safety laws and regulations\n7 International Institute of Ammonia refrigeration (IIAR) standards for good work practices\n7 Applicable local fire Codes and California laws and regulations for the handling of hazardous materials.\n\n\nE.
