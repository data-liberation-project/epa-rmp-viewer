Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we store chlorine and sulfur dioxide which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide  valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine InstituteA?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the purposes of this facility is to store chlorine and sulfur dioxide for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine and  sulfur dioxide are not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide containers is subject to RMP Program Level 2.  \n\nThis facility was previously registered to store hydrofluoric acid (concentrations above 50%) above threshold amounts.  We no longer store >50% hydrofluoric acid above threshold amounts at this facility and that chemical is not included in this registration.\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prev"

This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\nA summary of our Prevention Program\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION A? Our facilities maintain current copies of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  In addition, this facility has current copies of all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.  Much of the information in these pamphlets is applicable to the storage of sulfur dioxide also.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW A? A hazard review is conducted for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide container storage process at least every 5 years.  We primarily use a checklist prepared by the Chlorine Institute which is relevant to our operations.  At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in this review.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES A? We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of storage and movement of containers.\n\nTRAINING A? All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 5 or 3 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store chlorine and sulfur dioxide receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to those chemicals.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nMAINTENANCE A? Container storage is the only process for RMP chemicals at this facility.  We perform a visual inspection of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the fork"

We have an Incident Investigation SOP which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as A?near-missesA? that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by Corporate safety personnel and are shared with all facilities within the company.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDIT A? A compliance audit is conducted at least every 3 years to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.  In addition, there have been no minor incidents or A?near missesA?.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facilityA?s emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine InstituteA?s Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only.  We will not respond to other types of emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required.\n\n\n6.
