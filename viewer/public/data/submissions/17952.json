The lookup table (Reference Table 14, p. 59, EPA Guidance) gives a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.08 miles (422 feet).  This method discounts the effect of the relatively higher emissions during the first 15 seconds of the release.  It probably underestimates the circle of influence.\n Modeling Approach:\n\n\tThis can be modeled as a transient release (since the release varies with time).  The bulk density of the cloud would be 23.4 kg/m3 due to the presence of aerosols.  The release radius Is calculated as above in the worst case scenario.  It varies as the release rate falls.\n\tModel results indicate that the toxic endpoint would extend 0.40 miles (2112 ft.) from the source of the break.  This result depends on the fact that the toxic endpoint is based on a 1 hour averaging time.  In fact, the model predicts the peak to occur after only 370 seconds which is far less than the averaging time for the standard of 3600 seconds.  The use of shorter averaging times and higher concentrations indicates that a one hour average concentration of 7.8 mg/m3 is unlikely to occur beyond about 0.1 miles.  Modeling guidance and EPA suggest that for very short duration releases (such as this) we should look at an averaging time closer to the duration of the release.  \n\tPollutants can be measured (and modeled) over any chosen averaging time.  The choice of an averaging time should be reflective of modeling conventions, EPA guidance and the effects of the pollutant of concern.  Every standard is set with an averaging time in mind.  In the case of the toxic endpoint the averaging time is presumed to be 1 hour.  That is, a citizen would suffer the effects of the pollutant if exposed to a concentration exceeding the toxic endpoint for an hour.  A method exists to convert standard concentrations from one time basis to other time bases.  The relation is:\n\n\tC12*t1 = C22*t2\n\n\tWhere C1 = concentration for time basis 1"

Choosing a 2 minute averaging time for the toxic endpoint moves the toxic endpoint to 0.19 miles (1003 feet).  \n\n\n\n\n\n Passive Reduction Techniques:\n\n\tIf a building were built around the SO2 storage tank credit could be taken for a reduction in emission rate.  EPA Guidance (p. 13) states that the release rate would be reduced by 90% but would continue for 10 times as long so the same total amount of contaminant would still be released.  The release rate would then be 0.02248 kg/sec for 2.5 minutes then 0.00352 kg/sec for another 47.5 minutes.  There is a building around the sulfonator so if a break occurred in this building this would be the appropriate technique to use.\n\tModeling shows that the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.15 miles (792 feet) using this scenario.  This information is useful to show that a broken line in the sulfonator building is of less concern than a release outside the building.  However, since the line outside the building is exposed to more hazards and there is more pipe outside the building than inside this passive reduction technique will not be used for consequence analysis.\n\nSummary:\n\n\tThe simplified EPA technique gives better results because it is unable to account for transient emissions.  The modeling approach is the appropriate choice for this scenario.  Since SO2 is a respiratory irritant and no one can criticize taking a more conservative approach, the use of a 2 minute averaging time is recommended which yields a circle of influence extending 0.19 miles (1003 feet) from the source.  No offsite consequences would occur from this scenario."

This should be modeled as a non-isothermal release to account for heat transfer between the gas cloud and the surrounding air and ground.  This gives a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.79 miles.  \n\nSB Equation Modeling Approach:\n\n\tThe SB Equation allows for the calculation of the evaporation rate of boiling liquids on land.  This value can be inserted into the model in lieu of the EPA derived value.  The SB Equation is designed for liquid pools that are relatively shallow which would not be the case if the EO tank ruptured and filled the dike.  The calculation will be done for comparison purposes.\n\n \nThe SB Equation is as follows:\n\tm = 4Xks(Ta-Tb) x (2 x 3.14159 x g x Vo)0.5 x t.50/(dHv x 3.14159 x as)0.5\n\n\tWhere:\tm = mass flux rate (evaporation rate), kg/sec\n\t\t\tX = surface roughness correction factor = 1 for concrete\n\t\t\tks = thermal conductivity of surface = 0.92 for concrete\n\t\t\tTa = Ambient Temperature = 25 oC = 298 K\n\t\t\tTb = Liquid boiling point = 283.77 K\n\t\t\tg = 9.8 m/s\n\t\t\tVo = Volume of Liquid Released = 128.7 m3\n\t\t\tt = time after spill (sec)\n\t\t\tdHv = latent heat of vaporization = 569,000 j/kg\n\t\t\tas = thermal diffusivity of surface = 4.16 x 10-7 for concrete\n\n\tm = 4 x 1 x 0.92 x (298 - 284) x (2 x 3.14149 x 9.8 x 128.7)0.5 x t0.5\n\t\t\t(569,000) x (3.14159 x 4.16 x 10-7)0.5\n\n\t    = 3.68 x (14) X (7924.7)0.5 X t.5\n\t\t569,000 x (1.31 x 10-6)0.5\n\n\t    = 4586.4 x t.5\n\t\t650.5\n\n\t    = 7.05 x t.5 kg/sec\n\n\tSolving this equation on a spreadsheet indicates that the entire tank contents would be evaporated in about 840 seconds (14 minutes).  This is two orders of magnitude less than the EPA's equation predicts due to the fact that the SB Equation includes no term for the surface area of the pool.  Degadis predicts that an unrestricted pool would cover 138,536 ft2 (to a depth of 0.1 cm)"

The alternative scenarios were developed by reviewing \tthe Process Hazard Analyses for these substances (which were done as part of \tthe OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) planning) as well as talking to \tarea supervisors and operators.\n\nEPA requires that one worst case release scenario be submitted to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity and one worst case release scenario to represent all flammable substances held above the threshold quantity.

The model can be run and the evaporation rate determined, then input this value into the model again as a continuous gas release (because the release is much longer than the averaging time used).  The evaporation rate determined in this manner is 69.6 lb/min which would take 3713 minutes (61.9 hours) for the EO to evaporate completely.  This should be modeled as a continuous, ground level, isothermal release.  Degadis indicates that the toxic endpoint (90 mg/m3) extends 0.47 miles for this case.\n\nSummary:\n\n\tThe last method is the most realistic approach although it probably overstates the extent of the toxic endpoint.  However, this conservative approach is acceptable for the worst case scenario.  The distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.47 miles should be used.\n Alternative Case Scenario\n\n\tEthylene Oxide has a boiling point of 51 oF.  It is stored as a subcooled liquid at about 45 oF.  The worst case scenario would be a tank rupture creating an instantaneous spill of the entire tank contents.  The tank capacity is 40,000 gallons.  Administrative controls are present which stipulate that the tank contents will not exceed 85% of capacity or 34,000 gallons (258,400 lbs).  It is assumed that since ethylene oxide is stored as a subcooled liquid it would be released as a liquid and would not flash immediately to a vapor.  This is born out by evaporation equations.\n\tThe m"

No significant difference in modeled results was found when the evaporation time was extended to 1 hour (a more reasonable assumption) although the time to reach the toxic endpoint was extended to 12 hours.\n\tThe evaporation of the SO2 will initially form a very cold vapor cloud.  It is likely that ambient moisture will be condensed in the cloud.  Some water vapor will actually freeze.  This will have several effects.  It will increase the bulk density of the cloud.  This will cause increased dispersion in the x direction due to slumping of the cloud.  Only a slight decrease in distance to the endpoint was found when increased plume density was modeled.  The temperature difference between the cloud and the ambient air will tend to cause increased dispersion at the margins of the plume.  Modeling is unable to account for this effect.  It should be minor because the effect should not penetrate to the center of the plume and it would exert its most powerful effect in the early stages of the release when the temperature difference between the plume and the ambient air is the greatest.  Modeling indicates that this occurs within the first 5 seconds of the release.  Subsequent rapid expansion of the plume brings the temperature close to ambient.\n\tThis rapid cooling and vigorous boiling of the pool of SO2 would cause a localized pocket of turbulence which would enhance the initial dispersion of the plume.  Nearby buildings also make the micro environment resemble urban land use as opposed to rural.  Large numbers of heat generating sources enhance this effect.  Previous modeling done in Muscatine indicates that an intermediate roughness length is appropriate to use near a facility such as this.

EPA defines the potentially affected population as all residents within a circle whose radius is equal to the distance to the toxic endpoint.  While all these people are potentially affected, in reality, only those downwind of the source following a release would actually be affected.  This drastically reduces the actual number of people who could be affected.\n\nSummary:\n\n\tThe modeling approach is the most realistic method to use.  It is appropriate to use a roughness length of 0.25 meters for this case.  A ten minute gaseous release was chosen in accordance with EPA guidance.  The effects of delayed release due to evaporation of liquid SO2 were not considered.  No credit was taken for increased plume density due to condensation of ambient moisture.  The worst case impact would encompass a circle around the sulfur dioxide storage tank with a radius of 4.75 miles.  It is important to understand and communicate to those who review the consequence analysis that the total number of people EPA defines as potentially affected is always greater than the actual number of persons who would actually be affected.  This difference can be very large.  This is particularly important when there is one large population center within the area being analyzed.  The only way a large number of people could be affected would be for the worst case release to occur (which is very unlikely) at the right time of day (usually the early pre-dawn hours) when the winds are extremely light and out of the right direction.\n\tFurthermore, the proper meteorological conditions must persist, unchanged for at"

However, the instantaneous concentration could exceed a much larger value for a short time and, even if it went to zero for the remainder of the hour, the 1-hour average would still exceed the toxic endpoint.  For example, if the plume reached a concentration of 900 mg/m3 (using a 6 minute average) after six minutes and then went to zero for 54 minutes, the 1 hour concentration would be 90 mg/m3.  EPA suggests looking at this situation with shorter averaging times when the anomalous results are obtained.\n\tThe highest results are usually obtained for an averaging time that is close to the duration of the release.

Passive mitigation techniques are present in the form of a dike and excess flow valves.  A building around the tanks would also be considered a passive mitigation technique and would be installed if it proved beneficial.  The dike will provide no benefit for modeling purposes because EPA techniques assume that gases stored as liquids by refrigeration and pressure will be released as gases and will not form a pool.

This is due to the fact that the SO2 aerosol would likely flash to vapor and greatly reduce the gas cloud density.
