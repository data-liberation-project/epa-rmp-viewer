      "SummaryText": "A) Facility Description\n     The Sony Technology Center - Pittsburgh (STC-P) is located at 1001 Technology Drive in East Huntingdon Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  The facility is located in close proximity to State Route 119, Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76), and Interstate 70.  Sony Electronics Inc. consists of three operations: Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) and component manufacturing, Color Television (CTV) assembly, and support functions which include Wastewater Treatment Plant and Central Utilities Plant.\n\n\nB) Aperture Grille (AG) Manufacturing Division       \n     AG department produces aperture grilles or masks- a CRT component- that are a thin sheet of cold rolled steel located inside a cathode ray tube (CRT) between the electron gun and panel glass.  The RMP is being submitted for Chlorine used in the production of AGs. \n                                     \n     B1) Aperture Grille Process\n          The aperture grille or mask serves as a screen to block stray electrons from hitting the wrong color  \n     phosphor on the panel glass.  Each grille contains several hundred apertures or slits.  The \n     manufacturing process begins with a rolled steel coil.  The coil is unwound and transferred through a \n     series of chemical process tanks and chambers.  Transfer of the material, or web, is accomplished via \n     a series of nip rollers, steering, and drive mechanisms.  The coil remains continuous until the final \n     shearing is performed.  Primary web processing steps are as followings:\n     1. Clean and degrease with an alkaline solution.\n     2. Coat with a photo-sensitive material followed by drying.  \n     3. Print the desired aperture pattern on the web using high intensity UV light exposure.  \n     4. Develop the aperture pattern.\n     5. Etch the aperture grille pattern on the web using ferric chloride solution.\n     6. Strip coatings with sodium hydroxide solution and rinse.\n     7. Shear the aperture grille to proper size.\n     8."

In addition, to comply with PSM regulation for updating PHA every five years, the chlorine system underwent the revalidation of PHA in July 1998 and again in August 2003.  A number of preventive engineering design features and procedural steps have been established in order to reduce the risk of occurrence of an incident and/or its severity.  The safeguards have been categorized into stationary source siting, equipment, and documentation.\n\n     C1) Stationary Source Siting  \n          Chlorine is received (as liquid) via rail service in 90-ton rail car in a protected area away from any \n     on-site traffic and other process equipment.  Liquid chlorine is then converted to vapor form which is  \n     the physical phase required for converting FeCl2 to FeCl3 (regeneration of FeCl3).  The chlorine tank \n     car as well as the facility are being monitored on a 24-hour basis by security surveillance cameras and \n     security guards.  The chlorinators and vaporizers are situated in a room which is isolated from the \n     supply system. All administration & engineering offices as well as auxillary services such as machine \n     shops and labs are located outside the supply system.\n\n     C2) Equipment Safeguards\n         The facility has a Total Preventive Maintenance (TPM) program on equipment according to the \n     recommended schedule by the manufacturer.  The PM program requires for periodic inspections of \n     tanks, piping, and other equipment to ensure their proper working conditions.

The Chlorine alarms are linked to the \n     security office via a Builiding Automated System (BAS).  In addition, several sensors that are capable \n     of detecting chlorine are installed around the supply system, fume scrubber stacks, etching process, \n     and the aperture grille building.  Additional equipment and related safeguards are:    \n     - The chlorine system is operated via a panel that is equipped with emergency power.\n     - An excess flow valve as well as thermal expansion relief provided on the supply system with \n       pressure indication on the expansion chambers.  An air mottor is attached to the tank car outlet valve to automatically shut off the supply during any upset process condition.\n     - To limit the amount of chlorine that could potentially be released due to ruptures, the supply line is  \n       divided into several sections with isolation valves which will be shut off automatically.  \n     - High pressure alarms are installed to notify the operators should a rupture disk open.\n     - Fail/safe settings for critical valves should loss of utilities occurs. \n     - The emergency stop buttons are present in accessible locations.  The operators can manually use the \n       E-stops should other engineering control devices fail.\n     - The sodium hydroxide purge scrubber will evacuate chlorine from the pressure side piping and \n       neutralize it.  \n     - Safety equipment such as"

Some of the items include self contained breathing apparatus units; full face respirators \n     with various cartridges; level-A encapsulating and level-B suits; portable gas detectors being capable \n     of detecting % LEL, % oxygen, and ppm level of chlorine; Drager pumps with various colorimetric tubes; \n     chlorine Institute emergency C kit; neutralizing supplies and decontamination tools; and first aid \n     supplies.  \n               \n          All emergency equipment is required to be inspected periodically with proper maintenance and \n     cleaning after every response operation.

These elements of the off-site response plan are incorporated into \n     the PPC plan.\n\n\nE) Accident History\n     Since operation of the system began in 1993, and as a result of various safety features and comprehensive employee training, the facility has had no reportable incident.  One minor incident occurred on July 27, 1995 in which one pound of chlorine was released.  Following the incident, corrective actions were immediately issued and all the actions were completed by August 10, 1995 (in two weeks).  In addition, through the management of change procedure, other safety design features have been added to improve the chlorine system since the incident.\n\n\nF) Release Scenarios\n     The facility has registered the chlorine system as a program 3 process.  Under the RMP, two separate release situations for the chlroine system were analyzed.  Although the facility is located in an area of rolling terrain, it is considered as urban for the release determination purposes.  This is due to presence of several obstacles such as terrain, hills, trees, glass manufacturing plant, warehouse building, a"

The Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)  Guidance was used to determine the end points for both worst case and alternative releases.  The endpoint for chlorine is assumed to be 3 ppm (8.7 mg/m3).  The atmospheric conditions, according to the guidance, are an ambient temperature of 77F and humidity of 50 percent.  In order to determine whether any public and/or environmental receptors are located within the hazard area, software (LandView III) and USGS maps were utilized.  \n\n     F1) Worst Case Scenario\n          The analysis is based on release of the full content of a 90-ton rail car which is presently being \n     used.  In order to determine the offsite consequences of a worst-case release and based on the EPA  \n     Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Guidance, the following assumptions were made: wind speed of \n     1.5 m/sec under very stable atmospheric conditions (class F) which allow for lower plume dispersion \n     and higher concentration; the duration time in which the release occurred is 10 minutes at ground level.  \n     According to the results, the release rate is 9 ton/min with an end point of 13.4 miles.  Within this \n     endpoint, there are several public receptors, however no environmental receptors can be identified.    \n\n     F2) Alternative Release Scenario\n          The modeling is based on release of 64 lbs of liquid chlorine in one minute due to a failure of supply \n     line under a wind speed condition of 3 m/sec.  The selection of wind speed is based on the EPA's \n     Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance which allows use of neutral atmospheric stability \n     (class D) resulting in greater plume dispersion and lower concentrations.  This will result in an end \n     point of 0.15 mile within which no public receptors are located nor are there any environmental \n     receptors.  Equipment safeguards (such as those identified in section C2) and extensive \n     employee"
