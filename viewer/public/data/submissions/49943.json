If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify 911 (emergencies) or the City of Riviera Beach Dispatcher (non-emergencies) at (561) 845-4123 and request response to the situation. Additional emergency response can be obtained through the Palm Beach County HazMat Team, if necessary.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled. The Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of Ft. Lauderdale - Palm Beach, Inc. (Pepsi) facility manufactures soft drink products. The facility consists of a 180,000 square foot operations building situated on approximately ten acres. The site is enclosed by a chain-link fence to prevent unauthorized entry. A maximum of 4,500 pounds of ammonia is stored at the Pepsi facility. The anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant during the manufacturing process. It is contained in one, 800-gallon (4,500 pounds) cylinder and associated refrigeration system pipes, pumps, and receivers. The refrigeration system is a closed loop system; therefore, ammonia is not released during normal operations. \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with engineering standards associated with the refrigeration industry. The facility completes daily preventive maintenance and contracts a licensed ammonia refrigeration contractor to perform detailed monthly preventative maintenance. The facility's prevention program also includes employee training. Operators receive both classroom and on the job training.\n\n\n\nPepsi has safety programs "
