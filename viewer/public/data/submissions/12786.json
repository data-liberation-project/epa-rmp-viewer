Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Diversified CPC International, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe have 4 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] and Butane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for an aerosol propellant.  Butane is used for an aerosol propellant..\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 282000.00 lb. while Propane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] and Butane are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 254000.00 lb., 224000.00 lb. and 146000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from A-17.  In this scenario 146000 lb. of Butane is released.  It is assumed"

Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.42 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 88396.03 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.22 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from A-31.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 55633.18 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.16 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from A-17.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 45812.37 lb. of Butane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.13 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from 152a.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 92055.12 lb. of Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from 152a.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist, What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP and Fault Tree.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/26/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Diversified CPC International, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is read"
