As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of sulfur dioxide and propylene.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of these covered systems as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the systems.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\n\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of sulfur dioxide or propylene.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes specific protocol for responding to a sulfur dioxide or propylene release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 8 CCR 3220.\n\n\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and acc"

The company provides sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfurous acid (H2SO3) to wineries, as well as welding gases such as acetylene, argon, and oxygen to its customers.  \n\n\n\nThe business is located at 1180 Vendels Circle in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, California, just east of the intersection of State Highways 101 and 46 West.  The facility is situated within a few hundred feet of State Highway 101 on the east side of the highway.\n\n\n\nThe company property is bordered by commercial businesses, light industrial facilities, and agricultural land. The facility is located south of the town of Paso Robles and lies at an elevation of approximately 740 feet.  The business lies west of the Salinas River in the Salinas River Valley between the Santa Ysabel and Paso de Robles Mountains. The average annual rainfall for the area is about 13 inches.\n\n  \n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. uses two PSM/RMP regulated substances, sulfur dioxide and propylene.  Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. maintains up to a maximum of 13,950 pounds of sulfur dioxide stored in 25-lb, 150-lb, and 2,000-lb cylinders on site at any one time.  Sulfur dioxide is purchased in 1-ton (2,000-lb), 150-lb, and 25-lb cylinders as a gas liquefied under pressure from a sulfur dioxide manufacturer. The sulfur dioxide may be sold directly to customers for use as a compressed gas without any processing or it may be sold as a sulfurous acid solution produced by mixing anhydrous sulfur dioxide and water. There is one sulfur dioxide system for production of the sulfurous acid solution and two fill points in the system, dep"

There is one propylene fill process at the facility.  Two 1,000-gallon propylene storage tanks are used to fill smaller cylinders (6, 15, and 24 gallons), which are sold directly to customers for use as a compressed gas.  Propylene, which is liquefied under pressure in the storage tank, is pumped through piping to the cylinder being filled.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. processes have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the systems.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has developed a preventive maintenance program in which each cylinder is inspected upon delivery. All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor. Each cylinder is equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization.  The propylene system pump and propylene storage tanks are equipped with pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide vent lines in the system are routed to a scrubber.  The scrubber is used to neutralize sulfur dioxide prior to releasing it to the atmosphere.  This is done by passing sulfur dioxide gas through a solution of sodium hydroxide and water.\n\n\n\nThe process building is ventilated using an exhaust fan at the wall and portable fans. The large roll-up door and man door at opposite ends of the building are typically open to ventilate the process area.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergen"

To save lives.\n\n  2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3. To protect the environment.\n\n  4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chemical health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. personnel circulate throughout the storage facility, taking note of unusual conditions.  In the event that a chemical leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of regulated substances from covered processes over the past five years (January 2007 - January 2012) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\nHowever, on July 20, 2011, there was a sulfur dioxide release associated with the fill system.  An operator failed to verify that the downstream valves were closed.  Liquid sulfur dioxide flowed downstream passing through the scrubber and out through the stack.  The high level sulfur dioxide alarm was activated.  There were no injur"

The facility updated the fill SOP's and retrained operators the following day.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis studies, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a facility inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. facility located at 1180 Vendels Circle in Paso Robles, California. The Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
