This company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place. Our owners,managers and employees are dedicated to  preventing accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in pressure vessels on our properties.  It is transferred into the vessel from semi-transports then transferred into nurse tanks.  The nurse tanks are then transported to the farmer's field where the anhydrous ammonia is injected into the soil. The nurse tanks storage capacities are included in our total onsite quanity.\n\nAn anhydrous ammonia storage tank is equipped with safety release valves that are designed to release pressure in the event the tank becomes over pressurized.  The tanks are also equipped with excessive flow valves that are designed to shut down the flow of ammonia if a sudden release should happen\n\nThe worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our Local First Responders as an on-going training program. More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency action plans, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nFrontier Ag Inc.  maintains and operates our NH3 plant in strict accordance with all State and Local regulations. The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply promptly with their requests for improvement.\n\nOur employees are trained in safety procedures, site specific operating procedures, plant maintenance and are competency tested over the training material. Each employee uses goggles and gloves as well as having adequate safety water during all operational procedures. With this in mind it makes it easy to report that there have been absolutely no injury ac"
