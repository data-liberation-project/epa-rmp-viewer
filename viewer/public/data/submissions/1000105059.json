Results are included with this submittal. \nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the use of a motive fluid has inherent potential risks, and worst-case and alternative case release scenarios cannot reach public receptors.  However, Ormat recognizes the potential risks to plant personnel and has structured its process design and safety programs to make these types of release events improbable.  \nDesign safeguards include the following: \n\u2022\tAutomatic Shutdown is initiated when select process variable ranges are exceeded.\no\tStop brine flow, initiating unit depressurization\no\tClose process isolation valves, removing motive fluid feed to turbines to stop turbine rotation\no\tStop process feed pumps\no\tDisconnect electrical grid breakers \n\u2022\tOperator-initiated Shutdown can be activated from the control room and from various locations around the stationary source to prompt the same actions initiated by an automatic shutdown. \n\u2022\tPressure Relief System is designed to prevent system overpressure due to process upsets such as blocked flow or accidents resulting in equipment exposure to fire.\n\u2022\tPhysical Separation of the process from potential public receptors.\nSafety programs are defined by the Accidental Release Prevention Program described below.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAlthough the North Valley process qualifies for an EPA-RMP Program level 1, an accidental release prevention program has been developed to meet the requirements of OSHA PSM and Nevada CAPP.  As part of the implementation of the accidental release prevention program, program elements are documented and implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of the motive fluid.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\nOrmat has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan at its North Valley process to address the requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program (EPA RMP - 40CFR68), OSHA Process Safety Management (OSHA PSM - 29CFR1910.119) and the State of Nevada Chemical Accident Prevention Program (Nevada CAPP - NAC 459.952 - 95528).  Ormat is highly diligent in handling the process of motive fluid and Isopentane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Ormat staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards while effectively and safely using the motive fluid for geothermal power production.\nOrmat has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the motive fluid system. Ormats policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of motive fluid.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nOrmats geothermal power production facility is fueled by geothermal brine from a reservoir located in the San Emidio Valley. The facility is located north of Reno, Nevada in an area that is generally uninhabited. The facility uses the process motive fluid as a working fluid in a binary Rankine cycle process for power production. There is one process in the stationary source.  The process is new with commissioning occurring in 1Q23.\nThe regulated substance managed at the stationary source is the previously mentioned motive fluid, Isopentane. The motive fluid circulates in a closed-loop power cycle, traveling through accumulators, pumps, heat exchangers, turbines, and condensers to produce electricity with turbine-driven generators. The electricity generated by this process is then sold to contracted off-takers. The maximum intended invent"
