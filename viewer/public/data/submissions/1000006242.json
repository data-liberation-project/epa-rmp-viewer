Facility Policy:  The management and employees of Okawville Farmers Elevator Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Washington County ESDA, and/or authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment. \n\n2.    Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for the direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 510000 pounds is storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.    Worst - case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n      a.    The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispertion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\n     b.    Alternative - case scenario:  The alternative-case scenario is assumed to be a release of 11,908 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in a period of two minutes from the rupture of a two inch transfer hose.  Before an automatic excess flow shut down valve/valves intervines or remote manual shut off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The distance to the end point (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.  The most likely potential incident would be a release from a break in a one inch hose scenario followed by release of ammonia for two minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual s"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispertion to 200 ppm) is .31 miles.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility is in compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 cfr 1910.111 \"storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in the RMP registration from, seed section 8.3 (b) and the \"State of Illinois, Fertilizer Law, Sub part A, Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.    Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.    Emergency Action Plan:  \n\n            a.    This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA standards 29CFR 1910.38 and 1910.20.\n\n            b.    Provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under Sara Title III (EPCRA).\n\n            C.    If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n                   1.    Within 15 minutes of determining the amount of release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:  the National Emergency Response Center at 800-424-8802.\n                   2.    Within one hour of determining the amount of release would effect the environment and over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:  Illinois Environmental Management Agency at 800-782-7860. \n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regardi"
