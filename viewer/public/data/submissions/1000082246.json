It asks the same questions that a thorough job briefing would ask, but in a systematic way by guiding through the major hazards in a checklist form. We review the checklist at the work site and mark which hazards are present. Yellow hazards must be addressed during the completion of the step by step job plan, Red hazards require the completion of the appropriate work permit. The permits are basically additional checklists for the special hazards that are identified. The step by step plan analyzes the work for the hazards of each step. The hazards are identified and what will be done to control them. These are assigned to an individual a"
