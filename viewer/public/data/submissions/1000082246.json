The safe management of chemical products is considered priority to minimize the risk to our community, environment, and personnel.\n\nAdditionally, Chemsolv(R), Inc. manages the facility in compliance with all Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (DEQ) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) regulations.\n\nTo ensure the facility continues to operate in a safe and responsible manner in compliance with all regulations, an extensive risk management system has been developed and integrated into our operating procedures.\n\nSignificant components of the system include training, operating procedures for chemical handling, inspection, maintenance, emergency response, and incident management. These procedures provided to responsible personnel and management's continual compliance oversight ensures safe chemical management.\n\nThe President, Regulatory Affairs Manager, and the Plant Manager are designated as having the primary responsibility and accountability to ensure the plan and all components are in compliance and implemented.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility is used for receipt, storage, package, and distribution of chemical products.  There is no reactive chemistry conducted at the site.\n\nBoth liquid and dry chemicals are received, relabeled, repackaged, bulked, blended, and placed in storage for shipment to industrial, agricultural, government, food, and cosmetic customers.

It asks the same questions that a thorough job briefing would ask, but in a systematic way by guiding through the major hazards in a checklist form. We review the checklist at the work site and mark which hazards are present. Yellow hazards must be addressed during the completion of the step by step job plan, Red hazards require the completion of the appropriate work permit.
