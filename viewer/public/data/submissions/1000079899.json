XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant, located near Crane, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at Cordona Lake.  The facility takes inlet gas and compresses it. The gas is then dehydrated to remove and entrained water in the gas.  The gas is then sent to a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream.  This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in an amine contactor tower.  The stabilized liquids are stored and trucked to delivery.  The gas then travels through a CO2 membrane for CO2 extraction.  The CO2 goes through a final dew point skid to remove any liquids left.  The CO2 gas is compressed and sent downhole as a flood for the reservoir.  Any residue gas is sent via pipeline to an offsite third party gas processing plant.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the Cordona Lake Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 29,000 gallo"

Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS. This scenario was selected as it is the largest flammable liquid vessel with the highest potential for off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a BLEVE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.50 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Cordona Lake Gas Plant. It is a small natural gas refrigeration plant. The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 1.  The plant has more than a threshold quantity of flammable chemicals, e.g. natural gas and NGLs, in a process.  The Cordona Lake Gas Plant is an existing facility but no receptors are present within the distance to the worst-case release endpoint. The plant foreman is responsible for implementation of all prevention program elements.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nHazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with ma"

He analyzes and evaluates hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when he believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe hazardous analysis findings are forwarded to corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the engineer.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the engineer's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Cordona Lake Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating "

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral test, skills determination) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Cordona Lake Gas Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
