Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n  \n4.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.

No injuries on- or off-site occurred. The process was permanently shut down after the incident because we were unable to reduce the risks of more releases below an acceptable level.  This was our way to assure the safety of the workforce and the community. Consequently, the s"
