Sanford, North Carolina, Plant 12/28/12 (changed Saiden Technologies to STI Polymer, Inc.)\n\nOverview of activities and facility design.\n\nSTI Polymer, Inc.is a state-of-the-art polymerization plant built in Sanford, NC.  The plant has been designed and built to best engineering practices and in accordance with all relevant codes and regulations.\n\nThe plant was designed for optimal safety and efficiency by professional engineering contractors and consultants.\n\nSTI Polymer, Inc. uses a batch process in which monomers are reacted to form water-based emulsion polymers, which are then compounded into adhesives and other products for use in the carton, bag, label, construction, coating, roofing, flooring, dust control and other industries.  During the polymerization process, trained operators monitor reactions frequently and document readings.  Using human logic, pre-engineered safeguards, and automatic safety controls, thoroughly trained operators maintain control of the processes and prevent releases of chemicals from explosion, over-pressure or over-filling. Vinyl acetate monomer will be stored in a single bulk tank.  This tank has been built to ANSI codes and tested before and after installation to ensure integrity.  Daily operational procedures specify the use of checklists that include steps to record the tank levels and temperatures, as well as to visually inspect the dike around the tanks to ensure no tank is leaking. The daily recording of the tank levels provides a running record that can be used with inventory records to ensure that any leaks are detected immediately.\n\nSafety Program\n\nSTI Polymer, Inc. has a strong OSHA Process Safety Management program that is designed to prevent any accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals. Upper management and company ownership have supported the development of this program and given guidance where necessary to ensure this program is enacted to its full capabilities.  Early in the"

      "SummaryText": "development of the facility, an initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted.  While the plant was still in the \"green field\" stage, recommended changes to engineering plans were made before construction began.  After the design was finalized, follow-up PHA meetings were conducted to ensure that (1) recommendations from the initial meeting were resolved appropriately and (2) the PHA is consistent with the actual installation of the process equipment.  The company found the PHA to be an outstanding tool for training employees about the process and identifying and addressing potential hazards.  Not only did the PHA team address design issues, but also many necessary operating procedures, maintenance issues, and general safety issues were addressed and noted as required.  In January 2008 the second revalidation PHA was held to ensure no new hazards were present and all safeguards were still in place. Again in October 2012 STI Polymer conducted another 5-year revalidation on site.  During the PHA revalidation process in November 2017 safeguards still in place.  In October and November of 2022, the revalidation was conducted, and the cross functional team found all safeguards to be in place.   Process controllers from the tank farm to the process tanks were upgraded in 2022 which has improved the safety of the monomer transfer system.\n\nAll employees are encouraged to report anything they believe may cause an accident of any kind, whether it is an unsafe work practice or an unsafe condition.  These near miss reports, as well as incident reports, will be formally investigated following the facility's incident investigation procedure.  In addition, employees are encouraged to recommend process improvements, including changes in SOPs and suggestions to improve the process itself.  Continual Improvement is an integral part of the culture at STI Polymer and has led to many strong suggestions and improvements over the years.  All employee suggestions are researched and a"

The Safety Committee at STI Polymer, Inc. encompasses all groups of employees, not just upper management or shift supervisors.\n\nResponse Plans\n\nSTI Polymer, Inc. emergency response plan is written to cover spills, fires, and accidents.  Our standard procedure will be to only fight small fires, which can be contained and put out with a hand-held fire extinguisher.  The local fire department will be called on to fight any large fire.  The sprinkler system in the facility will be activated automatically if heat or smoke is detected.  This system is connected to a monitored alarm system, which will alert the monitoring company to call 911.  The local fire department has been given a list of all chemicals and their storage locations, along with a tour of the facility.  The standard NFPA labels will be on all large tanks or storage buildings for easy identification.  The local fire department is to be informed of any changes in chemicals or chemical inventories.\n\nKey production personnel are trained to the 24-hour HAZWOPER level to ensure that any accidental spill will be handled immediately and safely.  Spill kits are located throughout the facility in the most likely areas they will be needed.  Small spills will be contained, cleaned up, and disposed of according to all state and federal regulations.  An outside contractor will clean up any spill that is too large for STI Polymer, Inc. personnel to handle.  STI Polymer, Inc. will do everything possible to contain the spill until the contractor arrives.  \n\nIf the spill is above the reportable quantity, the Lee County Emergency Management (LCEM) office will be notified of how the spill is being handled.  If the release affects the natural environment or the public, the LCEM office will be notified immediately so that appropriate steps may be taken.  \n\nLCEM has been given a co"

Among other benefits, this will enable STI Polymer, Inc.to benchmark its safety program against the safety programs of other facilities in the Lee County area.  STI Polymer has also built a working relationship with the members of the LCEM LEPC including first responders as well as other industry leaders.\n\nVarious types of drills will be conducted, including but not limited to, tabletop, walkthrough, functional, evacuation, full-scale exercises, and outside source involvement.  It is important to be prepared, and there will be drills interspersed throughout the year.  All drills will be evaluated for effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nIn the past five years no accident involving Vinyl Acetate Monomer has occurred.  STI Polymer does conduct investigations on all incidents/accidents/ near misses to ensure all processes, equipment and training are accurate.  This contributes to the safe handling of Vinyl Acetate monomer by resolving any possible issues before they occur.  We have found the near miss program is very successful in eliminating hazards before they occur.\n\nFuture Goals\nIt is STI Polymer, Inc.'s intent to treat the RMP plan and OSHA PSM program as living, growing documents.  As the plant operates and grows, we will strive to ensure all changes are made in a manner that maintains or improves safety and environmental responsibility.  We will continue to build a strong environmental, health, and safety program through employee participation, compliance audits, maintaining SOPs, and community involvement."
