The facility is situated within a few hundred feet along Highways 101 / 46 on the east side of the highway.\r\n\r\nThe company property is bordered by commercial businesses, light industrial facilities, and agricultural land. The facility is located south of the town of Paso Robles and lies at an elevation of approximately 740 feet.  The business lies west of the Salinas River in the Salinas River Valley between the Santa Ysabel and Paso de Robles Mountains. The average annual rainfall for the area is about 13 inches.\r\n  \r\nSulfur dioxide is the RMP-regulated substance maintained onsite.  It is purchased from a vendor in cylinders as a gas liquefied under pressure. The sulfur dioxide may be sold directly to customers for use as a compressed gas without any processing, or it may be sold as a sulfurous acid solution produced by mixing anhydrous sulfur dioxide and water. There are two separate fill points within the sulfur dioxide process for the production of sulfurous acid solution, depending upon the size of the vessel required to fill an order (Large Fill and Small Fill).  A maximum of 7,500 pounds of sulfur dioxide is maintained on-site for both storage and the fill process.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the sulfurous acid process is not in operation. The process will remain part of the PSM/RMP/CalARP documentation as the facility may utilize the system in the future. Therefore, sulfur dioxide cylinders will arrive on-site for purchase by customers and will not be tied to any process.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has developed a PSM/RMP/CalARP Program to manage the handling of sulfur dioxide. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSafety information regarding the chemical hazards, and operating and technical specifications for the process equipment;\r\n\u00bf\tWritten procedures for handling and inspecting the cylinders, and operating and maintaining the fill process;\r\n\u00bf\tTraining for employees involved with cylinder"

The cylinders are equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization and rupture.  The cylinders are inspected upon delivery, and any cylinders with damage are rejected and returned to the supplier.  All cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor.\r\n\r\nThe fill process is located inside the production building. The building ventilation fan and neutralization tank/scrubber system are turned on prior to operating the process.  Any vapors produced during fill is exhausted through the ventilation fan and discharged to the neutralization tank/scrubber system located outside the building.   Sensors are also installed in the production building and the scrubber exhaust to monitor releases of sulfur dioxide.\r\n\r\nThere are check valves on the fill line from the sulfur dioxide cylinder to the sulfurous acid container to prevent contamination of the sulfur dioxide. In addition, there are safety relief valves in the fill process.  If a relief valve actuates during fill, any sulfur dioxide vapor would be exhausted through the ventilation fan and discharged to the neutralization tank/scrubber system.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property d"

As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of sulfur dioxide.  \r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program for this facility.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling of highly hazardous chemicals. Written procedures have been developed for handling and inspecting the chemical cylinders, and for operating and maintaining the fill process.  The company training policy requires all employees to be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.  The facility's maintenance program requires periodic inspections of process and safety equipment to ensure they are in good condition.  Overall, our program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nIncorporated into our program is our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled chemical release.  The EAP includes procedures for notification of local emergency responders.  The EAP is maintained current and updated periodically.\r\n\r\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the covered processes and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. is a retail supplier of various compressed gases for industrial, commercial, and medical use.

In addition, there have been no releases of sulfur dioxide that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity.\r\n\r\nHowever, on July 20, 2011, there was a sulfur dioxide release associated with the fill system.  An operator failed to verify that the downstream valves were closed.  Liquid sulfur dioxide flowed downstream passing through the scrubber and out through the stack.  The high level sulfur dioxide alarm was activated.  There were no injuries resulting from the release.  The facility updated the fill SOP's and retrained operators the following day.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the incident, a neutralization tank was installed in series with the scrubber. The operating procedures require both the scrubber and neutralization tank be running at all times during the fill procedure.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas, Inc. has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and outside emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for chemical exposure.  Employees perform drills and receive refresher training on the EAP.  In the event of a chemical release, the facility emergency coordinators will assess the situation and contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe following Process Hazards Analyses, which included a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a facility inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve site safety:\r\n\r\nApril 15, 2009 - Five Year Revalidation \r\nMarch 14, 2011 - Updated to include an increase in sulfur dioxide storage and the addition of the scrubber.\r\nApril 9, 2014 - F"
