      "SummaryText": "finished products and raw materials are successfully applied in a number of industries, including pulp and paper, water treatment, agriculture, wood, leather, and coatings.\n\t\n\tBuckman Laboratories\u00bf established the facility in Cadet, Missouri in the early 1960\u00bfs.  The Cadet Plant manufactures several of the specialty chemicals mentioned above.  The manufacturing of these products requires the use of several raw material chemicals regulated by the EPA as regulated substances.  The regulated substances handled at the Cadet Plant include the following:\n\t\n?\tBromine\n?\tCarbon Disulfide \n?\tDimethylamine \n?\tEpichlorohydrin \n?\tFormaldehyde\n?\tMonomethylamine \n?\tPhosphorous Trichloride \n\t\n\tManufacturing of the specialty chemicals occurs in the production area of the Cadet Plant, which contains 14 process vessels.  The process vessels are used to react and formulate the various specialty chemical products.  In addition to the process vessels, the manufacturing processes are supported by approximately 70 storage tanks, rail car loading and unloading stations, tanker truck loading and unloading stations, and various utility systems.\n\t\n\tProduction processes are monitored and controlled by a Distributive Control System (DCS), an automated computer control system.  The DCS allows for the continuous monitoring of thousands of process parameters, and allows for the quick identification of any parameters that may have deviated from their intended range.  The DCS is programmed to automatically correct or alarm these parameter deviations, allowing for the safe operation of the various production processes.  In addition to the DCS, highly trained Chemical Operators perform the day-to-day tasks required to safely operate the various processes.\n\t \n\t\n\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(d)):\n\t\n\tBuckman Laboratories\u00bf Cadet Plant complies with the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA), Accidental Release Prevention Rule, also known as the"

      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Program, also known as 112(r).  In addition to this rule, the Cadet Plant complies with various Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, which address accidental release prevention.  Specifically, Buckman Laboratories has established a Process Safety Management System for each of the regulated substances mentioned above.  In addition, Buckman Laboratories has also included several processes that involve reactive chemistries.  The Process Safety Management System complies with 29 CFR 1910.119 and the requirements of 40 CFR 68.\n\t\n\tIn addition to the regulatory requirements, Buckman Laboratories has also installed an emergency release containment system to reduce the consequences of an accidental release.  The Process Vessels are equipped with systems to relieve pressures that may build up beyond design limits.  The relief systems consist of piping, which leads from each Process Vessel\u00bfs pressure relief valve to a knock-out tank and quench tank.  These tanks allow for the containment of any released pressure and chemical vapor, thus, minimizing the potential release of regulated substances to the ambient air. \n\t\n\tThe process areas and tank farm areas also have passive mitigation systems, such as liquid release containment systems.  These systems consist of diked areas, which would contain any spilled material and limit the effects on the environment.  The design of these diked areas reduces the total surface area of the spill, thus, reducing the evaporation rate of the spilled material.  In most cases, these diked areas may reduce the evaporation rate by a factor of 10, which reduces the distance to the endpoints associated with an accidental release.\n\t\n\tChemical specific prevention steps have also been enacted and include the following:\n\t\n\tPlant-wide:\n\n\u00bf\tSpecially trained on-site Emergency Response Team which includes a Fire Brigade and Spill Response Team;\n\u00bf\tAbility to apply vapor and/or fire suppression foam;\n\u00bf\tImplementation"
