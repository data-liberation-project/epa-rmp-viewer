It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The EPS Williamsport, Maryland facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  The EPS Williamsport, Maryland Facility manufactures resins and coatings for numerous applications.  The Urethane Resin Manufacturing process uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a raw material.  The facility stores TDI in a 15,000-gallon storage tank.  The storage tank is surrounded by a secondary containment structure.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  The Williamsport, Maryland Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.
