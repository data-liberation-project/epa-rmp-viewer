The properties of this material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal & State of California rules and regulations.  These include EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP, 40CFR Part 68), OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 29CFR 1910.119), California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP, 19 CCR 2735-2785), and Cal / OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM, 8CCR 5189) as well as regulations referenced by these or incorporated because of the nature of the chemical.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle the ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics is a wholesale food distribution warehouse.  It stores bare root trees, and plants, frozen food products for fast food chains and microwave meals and other products in over 3 million cubic feet of current storage space with the capacity of storing in excess of 30 million pounds of products in spaces from -20 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in two (2) refrigeration systems at the warehouse.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia at the site is completely contained within two (2) closed loop refrigeration systems at all times.  A maximum intended inventory of 12,062 pounds of ammonia is utilized in the covered process associated with Engine Room #2 and an estimated maximum intended inventory of 7,073 is utilized in Engine"

Engine Room #1 has been decommissioned and does not contain any ammonia.  \n\n\n\n3.0 Worst and Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe areas affected by a release of ammonia have been calculated and are part of the RMP.  They have not been included in the executive summary at the direction of the EPA due to homeland security considerations.\n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The hazardous materials management and safety programs implemented at the facility for the ammonia related activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility keeps comprehensive Process Safety Information (PSI) documentation on the ammonia process at the California Cold Logistics facility. This PSI assists the employee operators and outside contractors in understanding the ammonia process so they can operate and maintain the refrigeration system in a safe efficient manner. A copy of the PSI is available for review to all employees who work on or near the ammonia process equipment.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If and/or Hazop. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of every five years. The process hazard analysis is also revalidated when there is an extensive change in the process. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n\n\nTraining:\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. New employees receive training in process operations, followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at California Cold Logistics to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Californi"

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nCalifornia Cold Logistics believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule; including information resulting from process hazard analysis, in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, California Cold Logistics hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. California Cold Logistics has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process.

The Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the Yuba City Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if needed.  The Sutter County Environmental Health Division incorporates this response into the County Area Plan.\n\n\n\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. We will continue our annual facility evacuation drills and planning/training site visits with the Yuba City Fire Department in the future.\n\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the RMP to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated substance in the regulated process of the refrigeration system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance.\n\n"
