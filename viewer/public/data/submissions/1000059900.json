PCS Phosphate - White Spring's employees will mitigate or contain the release and assist in the provision of emergency medical treatment for any injured personnel. \r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nThe White Springs facility employs about 480 people. Phosphate rock mining takes places within a project area of over 100,000 acres or about 160 square miles. The Hamilton County Mine, located just off US 41 approximately eight miles north of White Springs, produces nearly four million tons of phosphate rock each year. This rock is used at the two chemical plants to produce various phosphate products. The Swift Creek Chemical Plant is located on US 41 adjacent to the Hamilton County Mine. The Suwannee River Chemical Plant is located on County Road 137, approximately six miles north of White Springs. \r\n\r\nThe Suwannee River plant produces a sulfur enhanced monoammonium phosphate (MAP). The Sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, are used as the primary ingredients in production. However, anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance that is stored above the threshold quantity. In addition, the Suwannee River plant is the only location that stores and processes anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the Suwannee River plant by trucks that are not disconnected while loading. The ammonia is stored in two bullets (tanks).  Safety features in the storage area include relief valves and excess flow valves on the tanks, ammonia sensors and alarms, and a shut-off valve system to stop transfers of ammonia - if preset conditions are exceeded. These valves will fail-closed in case of a power failure. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the trucks to the storage area using specially designed piping and pumps. Safety features in the unloading area include: \r\n\r\nAn emergency shut-off valve system (which fails closed in case power is lost) activated by any of six switches located strateg"

Referenced documents, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Process Safety Management Plan, and SPCC plans are maintained at the facility and are available for inspection. \r\n\r\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nThe PCS Phosphate - White Springs policy is to provide a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors. This policy includes prevention of accidental releases through the use of initial design to recognized standards, preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel. A Management of Change process is used for all changes other than replacement in kind. A work order system is in place for employees to formally report deficiencies and track progress until completed. \r\n\r\nIt is PCS Phosphate - White Springs' policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policies, and regulations. Operations of the facility are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during normal operating periods or emergencies. \r\n\r\nThe goal of PCS Phosphate - White Springs is to prevent emergencies from ever occurring. However, should an event occur, the immediate goal is to keep the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries and not allow it to present a threat to the health and safety of the public. All procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel. Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions. \r\n\r\nIt is the emergency response policy of PCS Phosphate - White Springs to immediately notify Hamilton County authorities, the LEPC, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center of a release of anhydrous"

Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provides a system to prevent accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each job task. The safety and operating procedures manuals contain detailed job descriptions related to each task. The manuals are reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes. Each shipment receives a detailed pre-unloading inspection, inspection during unloading, and a post unloading inspection by the operator. Employees and contractors are trained regularly to insure proficiency in all phases of the operation. \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThere have been no releases of ammonia meeting the reporting requirements of \u00a768.42(a) of the RMP rule during the last five years. In fact, there have been no releases of ammonia that have affected offsite receptors in the 40-year operating history of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program \r\n\r\nThe PCS Phosphate - White Springs facility has developed an Emergency Management Plan designed to address prevention, preparation, response and recovery from a variety of potential emergencies. This includes an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility.

The Process Safety Management program is integral to the RMP and includes, among other materials, procedures for Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, Employee Involvement, and Management of Change. \r\n\r\nThis facility maintains an aggressive training program for all members of its emergency response teams (medical, hazardous materials, rescue and fire), its emergency management group, and general employees. In addition to the initial training programs for all emergency response team members, quarterly refresher training is provided along with frequent drills and exercises. Emergency response equipment is maintained in prime condition and includes two fully equipped ambulances, a hazardous materials response vehicle, two fire engines, a water tanker with a monitor nozzle, and sophisticated rescue apparatus. \r\n\r\nThe emergency response teams operate under the NIMS Incident Command System. All positions in each response team have at least two alternates and all members of the Emergency Management Group have designated and trained alternates. \r\n\r\nBecause of the isolated nature of the location, PCS Phosphate - White Spring's facility coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams. This training includes joint exercises. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nA Safety Plan is developed each year by the Safety Manager and staff and followed to completion. Additional improvements will include the implementation of the Action Items identified by the 2018 Process Safety Management audit.
