Facility Policy.\n\n     The owners, management and employees of Rod's Fertilizer Sales (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the evnvironment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 57,400 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Secnario.\n\n     A.  The worst-case scenario would be the release  of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period 10\n     minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 57,400 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank\n     at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per\n     million, or ppm) is 1.75 miles.\n\n     B.  The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release\n     from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual  shut-off\n     intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds.  The distance to the\n     endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.56 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous"

(ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that; have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\n\n     The facility has:\n     a.  A written action plan, inaccordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n     b.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required\n          under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n     c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n          planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of\nsafe conditions.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implemention at this time."
