      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Equinox Oil Company Zif Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as\ntraining personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of\nour processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of\nregulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to\ncontrol and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Zif Plant, located approximately seven miles south of Clay City in Wayne County, Illinois,\noperates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane,\nbutane/gasoline [BG]-mix and condensate) from natural gas. The Zif Plant has several regulated\nflammables, such as propane and BG-mix. There are no regulated toxic substances at the Zif facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level\n3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the\nlargest storage tank containing BG-mix and condensate. A written procedure is in place to limit the\nstorage inventory to 24,000 gallons, (85% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced\ninventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1psi\nendpoint for this WCS is 0.41 miles. Although controls are in place to prevent such releases and to\nmanage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in\nevaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substance's At the Zif Plant is a VCE resulting\nfrom the release of propane from the propane storage area. The maximum distance to the 1 - psi\nendpoint for this event"

Figure 1-1 graphically presents the hazard assessment results for\nthe flammable WCS and ARS events.\n\fGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Zif Plant. Because\nprocesses at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk\nmanagement program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration's (OSHA's)  process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each\nof the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident\nprevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Zif Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and\naccident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical\ndocuments and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA)\nteam. Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention\nprogram. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are\ndocumented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each\naccident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way\nwhich address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to\npromote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of\nthe plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Zif Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of\nthe processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key\nprocess parame"

Specific departments within the gas plant are  assigned responsibility for maintaining\nup-to-date process safety information. A table  summarizing the reference documents and their\nlocation is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate\nany necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The gas plant ensures\nthat the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring\ninstruments, highly trained personnel,  and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown\nsystems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design\nand construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination\nwith written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and\nmaintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that\nsafety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n The Zif Plant has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are\nidentified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to  identify\nhazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Zif Plant primarily uses the fault tree analysis technique to perform these evaluations. Fault tree\nanalysis is recognized as a systematic hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using\na team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.\nThis team id"

In addition, operating\nand maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Zif Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted\nin, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.\nThe goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a\nrecurrence and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions\ntaken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are\ncomplete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the\ninvestigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected\nby the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports\ncan be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA re-validations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Zif Plant periodically\nconducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident\nprevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three\nyears. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops\nfindings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in\nresponse to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each\nfinding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained..\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Zif Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.\nFollow"

The Zif Plant\nincorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that\nnew equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when\nrepairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Zif Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.\nExamples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a\nlockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing\nmaintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or\nequipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control sparkproducing activities (i.e., hot work),\nand (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a\nconfined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a\nsystem to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Zif Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system\nrequires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including\nprocess-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and\nauthorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are\nin place to manage any new hazards, and (2) verify that existing controls have not b"

New employees\nreceive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.\nAfter successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn\nprocess-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills\ndemonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own,\nthey can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the\noperating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\nThis refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for\neach operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\nContractors\n\nThe Zif Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance\nor construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas\nplant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2)\nhave the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4)\nunderstand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety\nrules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is\naccomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and\nhealth hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their\nbeginning work.

Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance\nto ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Zif Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in\nthe process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures,\npersonnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into\nservice. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with\nthe design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review\nteam uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification that accident\nprevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Zif Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping\nsystems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems\nin a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2)\ndeveloping written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified\ndeficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
