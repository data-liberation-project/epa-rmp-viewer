The plant is staffed by approximately 10 regular employees.  This plant is located north Yuba City near the Feather River.  There are some residences and commercial/industrial occupancies nearby.  The facility processes potable water for Yuba City and surrounding communities.    \n\nThese EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) Support Documents satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 68.  \n\nA. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe WTF accidental release prevention policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The facility adheres to all applicable procedures of the federal EPA Risk Management Program (EPA-RMP).  The emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans, which are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response of the community and local responding agencies.  It is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program (ARP) is in compliance with the federal and State OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and is based upon the following key elements:\n?A high level of training for the facility state certified plant operators.\n?A preventive maintenance program with strict adherence.\n?Use of state of the art process and safety equipment to control and neutralize any accidental release of chemical.\n?The use of an accurate and effective operating procedure written with participation of the operators.\n?Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n?Assignment of the facility chief operator with overall responsibility of the RMP and Cal/ARP\n?Implementation of an auditing and inspection program under the direction of the facility chief operator.\n\nThese policies and"

      "SummaryText": " procedures are described in the Yuba City Water Treatment Facility Process Safety Management Plan.  This plan, as required by State and local regulatory agencies, also contains information and procedures relating to chlorine processing equipment, handling, leak response and repair procedures, education and safety training.  It contains a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and various report forms.\n \n\nB.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThis hazard assessment was prepared in compliance with Subpart B of 40 CRF 68.  This is described in sections B1 through B9.\n\nB1. Applicability\n\nThe Yuba City Water Treatment Facility handles chlorine, an EPA-regulated substance, in amounts exceeding the regulatory threshold of 2,500 lbs.  This process of chlorination is subject to OSHA Process Safety management (PSM) requirements.  This qualified the facility as a Program 3 process.\n\nB2.   Offsite consequence Analysis Parameters\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis parameters are listed below.\n\n(a) Endpoint\n\nChlorine - As required by EPA, the chlorine toxic endpoint used is 0.0087 mg/L.   This corresponds to 3 parts per million by volume (PPM), and represents the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG) ? 2, which is defined as ?the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?\n\n(b) Wind speed/atmospheric stability class\n\nAs required by EPA, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s), and an atmospheric stability class F were used for performing the offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case release scenario.\n\n? Ambient temperature/humidity\n\nEPA RMP regulations for the worst-case release analysis assume 25-degree C. (77 degree F.) and 50% humidity for the dispersion analysis of the worst-case scenario.  \n\n(d) Hei"

      "SummaryText": "ght of release\n\nThe RMP regulations require that, for the worst-case release analysis, the release should be assumed to occur at ground level (0 feet).  Accordingly, the worst-case release analysis was performed at this level.\n\n(e) Surface roughness\n\nRMP regulations require that either urban or rural topography should be used for performing the air dispersion analysis for the identified release scenarios.  The rural and urban topographical conditions are characterized in the air dispersion models in terms of surface roughness.  The rural condition, defined by EPA as ?no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed?, is characterized by a surface roughness of 0.03 meter, whereas the urban condition is characterized by a surface roughness of 1.0 meter.  Urban topographical conditions were chosen due to the trees and buildings in the facility vicinity.\n\n(f) Dense or neutrally buoyant gases\n\nRMP regulations require that the models used for dispersion analysis should appropriately account for the density of the released gas.  Since the chlorine gas released during the identified accidental release scenarios would be denser-than-air-, the Dense Gas Air Dispersion model was used for performing the air dispersion modeling.\n\n(g) Temperature of released substance\n\nThe facility process temperature coincides with the ambient temperature.  Therefore, the temperature of any released chlorine is the same as the ambient temperature.\n\nB3. Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRMP regulations require that a worst-case release scenario analysis be performed in compliance with specified conditions, as detailed below.\n\n(a) Number of release scenarios\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario for each chemical, estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.  The worst-case release scenario selected was the complete release of the foll"

One-ton chlorine container (2000 lbs.)\n\n(b) Worst-case release quantity\n\nThe one-ton (2000 lbs.) worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel.  The container is provided with a negative pressure regulator on the manifold and an automatic valve shutoff system that is activated in the event of gas release.  The chlorine building is also provided with an automatic chemical scrubber system to neutralize the contents of the tank.\n\n(c) Worst case release scenario for toxic gases\n\nAccording to the RMP regulations, it should be assumed that, for toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the quantity present in a vessel will be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate is assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10.  The boiling point temperature for chlorine is ?31 degrees F; thus, chlorine is a gas at ambient temperature.  The worst-case chlorine release rate was therefore estimated at 200 lb. /min.  The potential of any released gasses from the building is very low taking into consideration the automatic valve actuation devices on each cylinder; and, the construction and containment the building provides and the chemical scrubber system in place.\n\nA summary of all the parameters selected for the dispersion modeling is presented in Table B-1.  \n \n\n\nTable B-1\nDispersion Model Summary Sheet for the \nChlorine Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nInput Parameter-Release Scenario:Tank Release\nRelease Quantity (lb.)-2000\nRelease Rate (lb./min)-200 \nRelease Time (minutes)-10 minutes\nPhysical State-Gas\nRelease Direction-Ground\nRelease Temperature (degrees C)-25\nRelease Pressure (atm)-1\nAmbient Temperature (degrees C)-25\nAmbient Pressure (atm)-1\nStability Class-F\nWind Speed (m/s)-1.5\nConcentration Averaging Time-600 seconds\nEPA Level of Concern for Chlorine-3 ppm\nTerrain-Urban\n\nDispersion Modeling Results --The chlorine concentrations at endpoint p"

Due to the building enclosure, the maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 0.9 miles.\n\nB4. Alternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nRMP regulations require that at least one alternative scenario be identified and analyzed for each regulated toxic substance.  However, if systems are in place showing that no reasonable scenario could lead to offsite consequences, a scenario that has no offsite impacts can be used for the alternative scenario.  The chlorine facility at the treatment plant is provided with a fully enclosed structure having an automatically activated chemical scrubbing system for the released chlorine.\n\n(a) Scenarios to Consider\n\nRMP regulations require that a scenario, which is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario, be selected as the alternative release.  The scenario selected involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtails) connected to the one-ton containers.  \n\nUpon release of the chlorine gas from the line, the leak detection system (with battery backup) would activate the emergency shut off system for the chlorine cylinder.  The emergency chlorine valve actuator will terminate a leak within 1.5 seconds automatically using the detection system or it can be initiated manually by means of locally mounted panic buttons.\n\nIn the event of a failure of the valve actuator ability to shut the flow of chlorine from the tank, the chemical scrubber system has the capability to neutralize the contents of the faulty chlorine tank.\n\n(b) Parameters to be Applied\n\nNone applicable with this scenario.\n\n\n(c) Consideration of Mitigation\n\nThe active mitigation system considered is the actuation of a chlorine detector connected to an automatic valve shut off system.

This system allows for immediate notification of chlorine leaks to facility operators who will then initiate the emergency response plan.  Any chlorine released inside the building will be neutralized by the chemical scrubber system.\n\nThe amount of chlorine released will be less than the EPA reportable amount of 10 pounds.  Emergency responders will allow this to disperse or neutralize before entering the facility to conduct repairs.\n\n(d) Factors in Selecting Scenarios\n\nThe rationale for selection of this scenario, which is more likely to occur than the EPA worst-case release discussed in Section B3, is based on performance of a hazard review.\n\nDue to the active mitigation system in place, we believe there is no reasonable alternative release scenario that could lead to offsite consequence to environment.\n\nB5. Offsite Impacts ? Population\n\nEPA RMP regulations require the determination of the potentially affected residential population within a circle with its center at the point of the release and a radius determined by the distance to the endpoint estimated to two significant digits.  \n\nConsidering the worst-case release scenario, it is estimated that approximately 1,774 people live within the endpoint circle and 200 people within the plume footprint.\n\nDue to the active mitigation systems in place, we believe there is no reasonable alternative release scenario that could lead to offsite consequence to population.\n\nB6.

It is in compliance with all EPA Prevention Program Requirements.\n\n1. Process Safety Information ? Yuba City Water Treatment Facility has developed and maintains written safety information about the chlorination process and the technology of process equipment used.  The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and to the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management.\n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) ? A PHA has been conducted appropriate to the complexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards using the ?What-If Checklist? and ?Hazard Review Checklists? processes.  These processes include the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error.  It describes steps used to detect and monitor releases.  This PHA will be updated every three years and the treatment facility will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\n3. Operating Procedures ? The facility has prepared written procedures that provide clear instructions for the safe operational activities associated with the process.  These procedures are included in the facility operations manual and the Process Safety Management manual.  The manual includes procedures for operation of all phases of the processes, and normal and emergency shutdown of the process.  \n4.
