At the Isomerization Plant, we emphasize continual analysis of the potential hazards of our process, annual training of our employees, and on-going safety.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7We have installed infrared monitors throughout the plant to detect flames\n\n\u00b7We have installed fire water monitors throughout the plant for fire fighting.\n\n\u00b7We monitor all the storage tanks and vessels for pressure, temperature, and liquid level.  We provided high and low level alarms, high pressure alarms, and high temperature alarms on all the storage tanks and process vessels. \n\n\u00b7We provided a siren system for plant evacuation during emergency situations.\n\n\u00b7We provided uninterrupted power supply for all high level alarms in the control room.\n\n\u00b7We provided emergency shutdown buttons at various locations within the facility in order to safely shutdown the facility during emergency situations.\n\n\u00b7We provided high level, high pressure, and high temperature shutdown capabilities for all our critical process equipment.\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1989.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the Isomerization Plant within the last five years.

Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for at Koch Hydrocarbon.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Isomerization Plant is one of many hydrocarbon processing facilities operated by Koch Hydrocarbon.  At the Isomerization Plant, we receive n-butane by pipeline and convert it into iso-butane.  The iso-butane is shipped out by pipeline as well as by rail and truck.  We also receive propane by rail and truck.  We purify the propane in molecular sieves.  The purified propane is shipped out of the facility by rail and truck.  Propane, n-butane, iso-butane, and hydrogen are the flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the facility.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans i"

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the butane or iso-butane in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Isomerization Plant, this would involve our 42,000- iso-butane bullet.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, at an overpressure of 1 psi, which is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts from a vapor cloud explosion, public receptors would be affected if this event were to occur.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, etc.) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario which would involve offsite impacts, is based on the failure of a 2 relief valve on the propane bullet.  When modeling this alternative release scenario, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account.  However, we have several mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  These measures include the following:  1) We conduct periodic inspection and testing of all the relief valves;  2) We keep the operating pressure of the bullet at well below the set pressure of the relief valve;  3) We monitor the liquid level in the bullet;  4) We provided a percentage gauge on the bullet for visual observation of the liquid level; and  5) We provided an automatic emergency shutdown switch to completely shutdown the product movement in case the liquid level in the bullet gets too high.  The presence of these mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurrin"
