Energy Transfer\u0092s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency planning and response activities in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility, and continuous improvement efforts to improve safety at the facility.\nNon-Responding Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nEnergy Transfer owns and operates a natural gas processing plant located near Stanton, Texas.  The Sale Ranch Gas Plant compresses and treats natural gas to produce residue gas (methane) and natural gas liquids (NGL).  After processing, the residue gas and NGL exit the plant via product pipelines. \nPre-treated, sweet field gas enters the pant via a pipeline, is dehydrated, and sent to the NGL recovery plant. At the recovery plant, gas is routed to a demethanizer tower, which separates it into a residue gas product stream and an NGL product stream. The NGL stream is purified using an amine treater, which removes carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Sale Ranch Gas Plant uses a flare to burn waste acid gas generated by the amine treatment system. NGL is then pumped into the sales pipeline for further fractionation downstream. Residue gas is also transported off-site via the sales pipeline.  \nThe RMP flam"

There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  \nEnergy Transfer has determined that the gas plant should be considered one process under the RMP rule.  This facility has one process (as defined by the regulation) consisting of a flammable mixture and propane.  Although the systems containing the flammable mixture and the propane are not interconnected, an incident in one of the systems could trigger a release in the other system, therefore, the two systems should be considered one process (see definition of \u0093process\u0094 at 40 CFR 68.3). \nEnergy Transfer has determined that SRGP is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the RMP regulation because the nearest public receptor is within the worst-case scenario flammable endpoint radius and the facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency planning and response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Energy Transfer. These high standards include: \n-\tOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n-\tOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n-\tCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility, operator training, and intervention.\nPrevention Program\nThe Sale Ranch Gas Plant is operating under a prevention program that involves identifying and taking s"

Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n-\tThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, or equipment are considered.\n-\tThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) process serves as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential process hazards and verification of safeguards, thereby leading to continual improvements in process safety and safe work practices.\n-\tThe Mechanical Integrity program ensures that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n-\tIncident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective and/or preventative measures are taken, as applicable, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance safe work practices are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent the recurrence of an incident.\n-\tInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements with any action items tracked to completion.\n-\tAn annual dialogue with the Martin County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Martin County Volunteer Fire Department will ensure a readiness to respond to potential emergencies, as well to implement improvements as the need develops."
