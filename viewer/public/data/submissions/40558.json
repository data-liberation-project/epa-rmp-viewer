City of Rio Rancho and OMI operates the 2 Wastewater Treatment Facility. This facility use chlorine gas for disinfection in excess of the RMP threshold of 2500 lbs. The City of Rio Rancho WasteWater Treatment Plant is located suburb of Sandoval Count. The plant stores up to 4 tons of chlorine gas in one-ton clylinders, in it's  treatment facilities and gas detectors. During normal bsuiness hours there may be other  OMI employees and/or consultants engaged in work on the Rio Rancho WasteWater Treatment Plants, sometimes near the plant process site. They do not enter the plant or the chlorine process area without direct supervision.  OMI management is committed to protecitng employees, the public, and the environment and to preventing injury or death that could result from chlorine gas releases. To do this, OMI has a variety of safety and emergency response policies in place to guide employees in general workplace safety, storage and handling of chlorine gas, fire prevention and suppression, and emergency response actions. The only worst-case release scenario, as specified by EPA, would involve the release of the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder in a 10 minute period. Based on modeling with EPA's RMP*COMP model, this could impact an area withing a radius of 0.2 miles of the plant. Any release from this plant would be mitigated by the fact that all the chlorine is is equipped with a emergency systems. The worst-case scenario is made even more unlikely by the fact that, in order for the entire contents of a ton cylinder to be released within 10 minutes by the cylinder would have to be split open. Given the extreme strength of the cylinder design and the extremely safe industry-wide record of this technology, only the most direct and severe trauma to the c"

However, for the purpose of compliance with the regulations OMI has included this figure in the RMP for Rio Rancho Waste Water Treatment Plants. The alternative-case release scenario involves the potential rupture of a 5/16\" valve or tranfer line during a cylinder maintenance or replacement operation. This scenario estimates the impacts of the release of approximately 320 lbs of chlorine over a 60 minute period, with the same mitigation measures. When modeled with RMP*COMP, this could impact an area within 0.1 mile radius of the plant. This area of concern would be entirely within OMI plant operations."
