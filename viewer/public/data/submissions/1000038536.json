As part of this commitment, the Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division in McGehee, Arkansas, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility. One component of this system is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Clearwater and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan Rule (the Rule).  One of the requirements of the Rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at Clearwater. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Clearwater.\n\n\n\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nClearwater is an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 345 full-time workers. Clearwater produces approximately 900 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates a coated paperboard machine, during which Clearwater handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Rule: chlorine and chlorine dioxide. \n\n\n\nThe Rule requires all regulated toxic substances contained in 40 CFR 68 that are stored in quantities above the specified thresholds to be included in an RMP.  Chlorine is present in pressurized containers above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and chlorine dioxide is present in a chilled aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThe regulated use of these substances at Clearwater is as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 1.  Summary of Covered Processes.\n\nProcess\n\nDescription    Program Level    Regulated\n\nSubstance    Maximum Process\n\nQuantity\n\nChlo"

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Clearwater does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that both might occur at a facility similar to Clearwater and would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. By identifying these potential releases, Clearwater has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be effected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.  The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard Assessment Documentation section of the RMP.\n\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (PROGRAM 3)\n\n\n\nSince Clearwater's inception in 1977, the mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, Clearwater formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the Rule established similar requirements for Pr"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of Clearwater's Program 3 prevention program that address the Rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nTo ensure the safety of our processes, equipment complies with good engineering practices and a variety of technical documents are maintained.  These documents address:\n\n\n\n?    physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n\n?    chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances, and\n\n?    design basis and configuration of the equipment\n\n\n\nClearwater ensures that this process safety information is available to all Clearwater employees and local fire and emergency response personnel.\n\n\n\nSafety Data Sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of hazardous substances handled at Clearwater, including regulated substances in RMP-covered processes. SDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available to mill operators for ready reference.  The SDSs for covered processes include the information outlined in ?68.65(b).\n\n\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

These documents are used to:\n\n?    train employees,\n\n?    perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and\n\n?    help maintain the equipment.\n\n\n\nAll the above mentioned information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.\n\n\n\n4.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nClearwater performs and periodically updates Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. \n\n\n\nClearwater primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) to perform this analysis as allowed by ?68.67(b)(4). The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to mill personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. \n\n\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nClearwater engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed. The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Clearwater employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including:\n\n?    initial startup,\n\n?    normal operations,\n\n?    normal shutdown,\n\n"

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change process. All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change review to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\n4.7  Pre-startup Review\n\n\n\nClearwater performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely. This review confirms that:\n\n?    construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications,\n\n?    adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place,\n\n?    employee training has been completed, and\n\n?    for covered processes, a PHA has been performed for new processes and management of change requirements have been completed for modified processes.\n\n\n\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n\n\n4.8  Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nClearwater audits covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of Clearwater operations. Clearwater assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure "

Clearwater trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented as described in ?68.81(d), recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented. \n\n\n\n4.10  Employee Participation\n\n\n\nClearwater developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of Clearwater employees are addressed. Clearwater encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities of all processes at the mill. Employees are consulted on and informed about all aspects of the RMP, including PHAs, employee training, and operating procedures.\n\n\n\n4.11  Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\nClearwater established a hot work permit program to control spark-producing or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at Clearwater. Clearwater reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form. The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.\n\n\n\n \n\n4.12  Contractors\n\n\n\nClearwater established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at Clearwater are performed in a safe manner.

Clearwater trains the contract supervisors in the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, in Clearwater safe work practices, and in mill emergency response procedures. Clearwater requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the mill before that worker begins work at the site. Clearwater periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed. \n\n\n\n5.0  CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Clearwater has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the mill. \n\n?    Chlorine specific release prevention is the use of the one ton cylinders in water treatment in various areas of the mill. These cylinders provide passive security against potential releases. \n\n?    Chlorine dioxide is produced at Clearwater and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a maximum of 1.5% by weight chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release. A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\n\n\n\n6.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nClearwater has had no releases during the last five years of chlorine or chlorine dioxide that have resulted in any offsite public or environmental effects or that have resulted in employee first aid treatment.\n\n\n\n7.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\n\n\nClearwater has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
