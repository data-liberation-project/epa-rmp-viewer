As part of this commitment, the Arkansas Pulp and Paperboard Division in McGehee, Arkansas, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility. One component of this system is a risk management plan (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Clearwater and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Plan Rule (the Rule).  One of the requirements of the Rule is to submit an RMP describing the risk management program at Clearwater. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the Rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Clearwater.\r\n\r\n2.0  REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nClearwater is an integrated bleached kraft mill that employs approximately 345 full-time workers. Clearwater produces approximately 900 tons per day of bleached kraft pulp and operates a coated paperboard machine, during which Clearwater handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the Rule: chlorine and chlorine dioxide. \r\n\r\nThe Rule requires all regulated toxic substances contained in 40 CFR 68 that are stored in quantities above the specified thresholds to be included in an RMP.  Chlorine is present in pressurized containers above the threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds and chlorine dioxide is present in a chilled aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nThe regulated use of these substances at Clearwater is as follows:\r\n\r\nTable 1.

The offsite consequence analysis consists of evaluating both worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Clearwater does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that both might occur at a facility similar to Clearwater and would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred. By identifying these potential releases, Clearwater has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \"Prevention Program\" section of this plan.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be effected in the event of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint, the effects would be less.  The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard Assessment Documentation section of the RMP.\r\n\r\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (PROGRAM 3)\r\n\r\nSince Clearwater's inception in 1977, the mill has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, Clearwater formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Unloading and Transfer and the Chlorine Dioxide Generation, Storage, and Transfer, and the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage and Transfer processes to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the Rule established similar requirements for Pr"

A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. \r\n\r\nClearwater primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) to perform this analysis as allowed by \u00a768.67(b)(4).

Clearwater periodically reviews contractor training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe work practices are followed. \r\n\r\n5.0  CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, Clearwater has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the mill. \r\n\u00bf\tChlorine specific release prevention is the use of the one ton cylinders in water treatment in various areas of the mill. These cylinders provide passive security against potential releases. \r\n\u00bf\tChlorine dioxide is produced at Clearwater and stored as a dilute aqueous solution to avoid the necessity of transporting large quantities of the solution. Chlorine dioxide is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to an absorber column, where a maximum of 1.5% by weight chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Storing this substance as a solution helps to reduce the consequences of a release. A curbed area around the storage tanks further reduces the consequences of a release.\r\n\r\n6.0  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nClearwater has had no releases during the last five years of chlorine or chlorine dioxide that have resulted in any offsite public or environmental effects or that have resulted in employee first aid treatment.\r\n\r\n7.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAMS\r\n\r\nClearwater has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
