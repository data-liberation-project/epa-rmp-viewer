We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nBAPM produces polyurethane foam seat pads for the automotive industry using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our process, we use Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\r\n\r\nOur facility has one 10,000 gallon storage tank to handle the TDI.  TDI is a main component of the chemical mixture used to formulate the foam seat pads.\r\n\r\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by the use of this chemical.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\r\n\r\nOur Worst-case Release Scenario would be a catastrophic failure of the 10,000 gallon storage tank.  This would involve the involuntary release of up to 10,000 gallons of TDI being released to the diked area located inside our building.\r\n\r\nBy using an advanced air modeling program, it was determined that the endpoint distance for a catastrophic failure is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROG"

      "SummaryText": "RAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBAPM maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operations.  The accident prevention programs in place include:  \r\n\r\n1.  Employees that handle the bulk truck unloading of the TDI receive extensive training before they are authorized to handle the unload process, and annually thereafter.\r\n2.  Internal checklists have been developed for the unloading procedures and are used for every unload.  These checklists reduce the risk of an accidental release.\r\n3.  The physical placement of the storage tank within a concrete dike located inside the facility\r\n4.  The storage tank is equipped with a high level alarm and sight gauges to prevent overfilling the tank.\r\n5.  Inventory records are kept at the plant and are checked before the truck is unloaded into the tank.  This verifies that the storage tank can accommodate the truck.\r\n\r\nThese  individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\r\n\r\nWe have not had a significant accidental chemical spill occur at our facility since the facility has opened.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a significant spill does occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the each event.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting"
