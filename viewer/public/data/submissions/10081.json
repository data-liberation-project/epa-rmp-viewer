This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nClemens Terminal is an underground storage facility of finished and rerun products.  The products stored in the underground storage domes are: Normal Butane, iso-Butane, iso-Pentane, Hydrogen, Natural Gas, Propane, Ethane-Propane mix, Butanes-Butylenes mix, NGL, Propylene, and Ethylene.  In addition to the underground storage domes.  Clemens is capable of treating Ethylene, Propylene, Propane and normal and iso-Butanes for sales.  These five products are treated through a molecular sieve bed for the removal of carry-over water resulting during storage.  Ethylene and Propylene are additionally treated for the removal of Carbon Dioxide resulting from the underground storage.  In our process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:  There are no toxics stored at Clemens Terminal\n \nFlammables:  Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Propylene, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2-Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario associated with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum intended inventory of the largest vessel containing a flam"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the Sweeny Complex's Accident Prevention Program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accident Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Clemens Terminal Risk Management System and in the Employee Participation Section of all other Risk Management Elements.  In addition, the terminal has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process safety and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the terminal, including operations, maintenance, engineering and terminal management.  \n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the Employee Behavioral Safety Process (VIPER) and OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program.  Clemens Terminal received the OSHA VPP Star award as part of the Sweeny Complex overall inspection by OSHA.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Clemens Terminal storage facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.

Typically, it is assumed the entire contents of the vessel are released instantaneously, thus calculating the distance to a 1 pound overpressure endpoint.  However, Clemens Terminal is an underground storage facility with large amounts of storage which cannot be emptied instantaneously.  Modeling was based upon a 10 minute release of a substance in the cavern through a failure of the above ground piping, which is the only piping that enters or exits the cavern.  This piping is considered the closest release point whereby the cavern contents can be released into the atmosphere.  Based on this modeling, our worst case scenario was a failure of the 8 piping on a NGL underground salt dome storage cavern.  In a 10 minute time period, 3,290,000 pounds of NGL would be released into the atmosphere resulting in a potential vapor cloud explosion.  Due to the piping configuration of the salt domes as stipulated by EPA General Guidance question and answers (Worst Case and Mitigation) 4-11, we have taken credit for passive mitigation.  The resulting vapor cloud explosion would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for flammable substances at Clemens is a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of NGL from a 1 nipple failure on associated piping on above ground piping of a cavern (59,640 pounds released over a 7 minute period).  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 7 minutes (active mitigation).  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  This scenario has no offsite consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Clemens Terminal.  Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PS"

For specific process areas, the terminal has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit-specific Process Safety Information (PSI) document.  The terminal verifies the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  \n\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Clemens Terminal facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the HAzard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the proc"

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Clemens has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nClemens uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Clemens Terminal has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. The Emergency Response Program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Clemens Terminal is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Clemens has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.

The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nClemens Terminal has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
