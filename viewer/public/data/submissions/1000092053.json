The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility process or other ONEOK Rockies Midstream facilities.

The overall emergency response plan for the Garden Creek Complex is coordinated with the McKenzie County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which is responsible for preparing the community's emergency response plan.  The local responders for facility emergencies are the Watford City, ND Volunteer Fire Department and the McKenzie County Sheriff's Department. The Garden Creek Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, sheriff's office). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\r\n\r\n8.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Garden Creek Complex will resolve all findings from PHAs.

(ORM)\r\nGarden Creek Complex\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1.0\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Garden Creek Complex (Facility) has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of said processes and equipment. Our policy is to implement reasonable engineering and administrative controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, facility personnel are trained to respond and control small releases. ONEOK Rockies Midstream (ORM) believes in maintaining a safe working environment for all employees. Our equipment and personnel reflect this belief, and our prime objective is to ensure the personal safety of every employee on the job-site and to safe guard company property through preventative measures. Employees of ORM are expected to be familiar with all company safety policies. Through continuing education, in-house training and management support, we will provide a safe and professional working environment for our employees as well as those whose lives and safety have been entrusted to us.\r\n\r\n2.0\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Garden Creek Complex, located near Watford City, North Dakota, uses mechanical refrigeration, cryogenic extraction and fractionation to process wellhead gas into marketable natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL). As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, gas condensate). There are three 60,200 gal (192,228 lbs), twelve 48,300 gal (181,494 lbs), fifteen 19,100 gal (68,114 lbs.), and twelve 33,500 gal (162,610 lbs) flammable mixture storage tanks.  The Facility does not use or store any"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls, or active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS was determined by RMP*Comp at 0.50 mile. There is one residence and 1 occupied industrial facility within the .5 mile radius of the WCS. \r\n\r\n4.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nGarden Creek Complex is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program regulation and also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\n5.0\tCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Garden Creek Complex have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\r\n\r\n5.1\tUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accidental release prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Garden Creek Complex. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\n5.2\tSpecialized Safety Features\r\nThe Garden Creek Complex has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

Releases that did occur at the facility involving a regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, or shelter in place.\r\n\r\n7.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Garden Creek Complex maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address or reference all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response.
