The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\n\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 505 3rd Street in Chester, South Dakota (the \"facility\").  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is routinely filled to 85% capacity.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000-gallon and 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 24 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n  \nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirem"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\n\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\n \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no applicable accidental releases at the facility within the last five (5) years, where accidental releases from covered processes resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility had an incident reported to the South Dakota Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources in a Voluntary Statement dated November 10, 2021. The statement includes the details of the minor incident, that did not require reporting to the National Reporting Center (NRC).  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility coordinates with the Chester Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release.  T"

The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combing the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
