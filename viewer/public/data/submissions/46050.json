Shaws operates many retail grocery stores throughout new england that are supplied through distribution and transporatation complex loacted in Methuen, Massachusetts. The Shaws Refigerated Distribution Center # 8353, located on this facility site employs over 420 people and uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anyhdrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals. Shaw's Methuen distribution center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequeneces that affected residents or the environment. Pursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Shaws (Albertsons) has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals on site. The facility completed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry Standard what-if?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). The PHA was completed using techniacl and operations staff from the Methuen Facility as well as experienecd  facilitators from an outside engineering Firm (Industrial Consultants LLC).  Shaws (Albertsons) implementation of the PSM  program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventative maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviewsand management of changes (MOC) to the system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices  (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements, Shaws (Albertsons"

      "SummaryText": ") undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental release of the largest vessel in the system. Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  Shaws (Albertsons) is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration process at the Methuen distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation and maintenance of the system. Shaws (Albertsons) employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with employees  regarding the hazards of ammonia and to ensure a safe workplace  and surrounding community. Specific questions regarding RMP compliance at Shaws should be addressed to Albertson's Environmental Affairs Department Albertsons has prepared this RMP in accordance with the requiremenst imposed by the April 2004 revisions to the RMP regulations."
