      "SummaryText": "The City of Neosho's Water Filtration Plant is a 5 MGD Public Water Supply for the City of Neosho.  Chlorine gas is used for disinfection of the water.  This presents the risk of chlorine gas release.  The Filtration Plant complies with all State EPCRA regulations.  The chlorination equipment was updated in 1995 to an all vacuum operated system, which is the safest type available.  By July 1999, a Chlorine Alrm System will be installed that will monitor the air in the tank storage area , which will notify the proper personnel 24 hours a day in case of a chlorine release.  In the past 5 years there has been no chlorine release accidents at the water filtration plant.  In a worst case scenario, if the total contents of a one ton cylinder (2000 lbs.) were to be released in 10 minutes with a wind speed of 3.5 mph, the toxic endpoint (.0087 mg/l) would be .9 miles from the plant.  In an alternative scenario, if  a release was for 60 minutes at a rate of 10.5 pounds per minute, and wind speedat 6.7 mph, the toxic endpoint would be .1 miles from the plant.  Operators have been trained in emergency response to a chlorine release.  We also work closely with the Newton County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Neosho City Fire Department in the event of any chlorine release.  Emergencies will be handled in accordance with the Newton County Emergency Operations Plan."
