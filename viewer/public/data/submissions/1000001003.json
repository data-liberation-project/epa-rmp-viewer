This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as\nrequired by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of\nthe current Risk Management Program and to describe further\nmeasures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of\nRS's.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's Wastewater Treatment Plant,\nlocated at 2880 S. Fifth Ave., Oroville, CA in Butte County, uses\nchlorine for disinfection in quantities greater than the\nFederal threshold quantity for this RS. The facility is located\nin an industrial area in Oroville. There are 9 full-time\nemployees at this site. Chlorine is received in ton containers by\ntruck, handled with an electric hoist, and stored on ton\ncontainer scales inside the building. The chlorine is used for\nodor control of the influent wastewater, to disinfect the\nwastewater effluent, and for other process uses. Pressu"

From there, the gas under vacuum is metered through rate\nvalves and rotameters in chlorinators located in a separate room,\nand drawn into water solution by the passage of pressurized water\nthrough an eductor.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of the Sewerage Commission Oroville Region that\nthe receipt, storage, and handling of chlorine at its facility be\ndone in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and\nminimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of\nchlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and\nsafety of its workers, the public, and the environment. In order\nto accomplish this goal, Sewerage Commission Oroville Region has\ngathered safety information on chlorine and on the process,\nequipment, and procedures involving chlorine; performed a\nstructured assessment of hazards of the process and external\nevents which might affect the process; performed an offsite\nconsequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a\nwritten program for prevention and mitigation of accidental\nreleases; and established a written emergency response program\ncoordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be\nconsidered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum\ndistance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on the site\nabove the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in\nthe ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest\nsingle container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of\n10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents\nof the largest container of chlorine on the site, in this case\n2,000 lb. This release scenario is not physically possible, due\nto the characteristics of chlorine.\n\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn \"alternative"

The \"alternative case\" considered for this\nfacility is the release of chlorine from a pinhole in one of the\nfusible plugs on a received ton container, due to a supplier\nerror or damage in transit, with the release secured by\napplication of a Type \"B\" Ton Container Repair Kit fixture after\n60 minutes.\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sewerage Commission Oroville\nRegion which were considered to mitigate the severity of the\nWorst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region's written policies and\nprocedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel,\nwritten procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at\nthe facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement\nmaterials and components for the chlorine systems.\n\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of\nthe Worst Case scenario. No passive mitigation measures were\nconsidered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case\nscenario. Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative\nCase, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and\nequipped employees.\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region are categorized as\nadministrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and\nengineering controls; and emergency response programs.\nSewerage Commission Oroville Region has instituted a Process\nSafety Manageme"
