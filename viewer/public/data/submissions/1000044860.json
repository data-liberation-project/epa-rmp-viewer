      "SummaryText": "OLS Energy-Agnews\r\nRMP for Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \r\n\r\nOLS Energy-Agnews, Inc. of San Jose generates electric power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine. As part of its emissions control it injects diluted ammonia vapor into the turbine exhaust, and thus reduces NOx emissions.  The ammonia is stored in anhydrous form in a 12,000 gal. storage tank, which is well anchored to prevent earthquake damage. However, per administrative controls, the facility only utilizes 85% of the storage capacity, which equates to a maximum storage of 10,200 gallons.  The ammonia is piped from there in liquid form to a vaporizer where it is turned into gas.  From there it goes to an accumulator.  From the accumulator it is mixed with air and injected into the turbine exhaust stream in the heat recovery steam generator.\r\n\r\n The facility has good preventative maintenance procedures and emergency response planning.  As part of the emergency response planning the facility has an Emergency Action Plan, which addresses every type of emergency or release the facility could expect.  The release of ammonia is specifically covered in the Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP for ammonia contains all emergency contact numbers as well as operator safety and mitigation procedures.   As part of the facility's accidental release prevention, training is conducted annually for employees on Hazardous Material Handling, Hazard Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operation, maintenance, and emergency procedures.  There is a specific procedure for delivery and handling of anhydrous ammonia, which includes specific operational guidelines as well as emergency actions.\r\n\r\nThe facility has carried out an initial Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  As a result or the PHA some safety improvements were made to the ammonia system and procedures.  These improvements are as follows:  1) Installation of relief valves between isolation valves on the piping between the unloading rack"

      "SummaryText": "and the tank, 2) Conducted a seismic evaluation and installed flexible lines from the tank to the supply pipe, fill pipe, and the vapor return pipe, 3) Plan to install additional vertical and horizontal support on the ammonia piping system by June 2000, 4) Installed emergency shut-off valves to isolate all three pipes coming from the ammonia tank, 5) Modified delivery procedures to take deliveries with and additional operator present during shift change on Saturday mornings, 6) Conducted an ammonia release during a delivery drill with Cisco Systems ERT and the San Jose Fire Department. \r\n\r\nThe facility completed another PHA and Seismic Assessment, with no discrepancies and recommendations to continue as currently operating. \r\n\r\nIn order to limit the distance of a release, the facility has identified or added the following:  1) If there is a leak on the ammonia injection skid, ammonia flow to the HRSG can be increased to decrease pressure until the leak can be isolated, 2) Emergency shut-off valves were installed to minimize a leak in any piping downstream of the ammonia storage tank, 3) An extra operator was added during a delivery to increase safety and decrease response time in the event of an accident.  \r\n\r\nOLS Energy-Agnews, Inc. has had no ammonia related accidents or releases in the last five years.  Additionally, the facility has had no ammonia related accidents in its operational history beginning December 1990.\r\n\r\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified, they will be evaluated by staff for application and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe facility has a completed Risk Management Plan and is actively implementing the RMP. The facility is in full compliance with all provisions of its RMP."
