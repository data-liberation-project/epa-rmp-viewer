      "SummaryText": "A.     Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe McKenna Falls Intake Facility (McKenna Falls) provides drinking water for the City of Bremerton (WA) and is operated by the City's Public Works and Utilities Department.  The water is diverted from the Union River and chlorine is used to disinfect the water prior to entering the City of Bremerton water distribution system.\n\nChlorine ton-containers are delivered to the McKenna Falls facility approximately once a month.  The facility maintains four ton-containers on site at all times, with two of the containers connected to the process at any time.  Although two containers are connected to the process at all times, only one is used to feed chlorine to the process, with the other used as standby.  The containers are stored on cradles inside of a building at all times.  The chlorine process at McKenna Falls pulls chlorine vapor from the containers under vacuum.  The chlorine is fed to a chlorinator where it is mixed with water.  The flow rate of the chlorine vapor is controlled by the flow rate of water into the supply system.  The facility has two chlorinators on site; however, only one is on-line at a time.  The ton-containers are connected to automatically change over to the standby container when the pressure in the on-line container decreases to a designated level.  The chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms are equipped with a chlorine leak detector.  These detectors are connected to the City's supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) system for alarms.\n\nAs a result of the process at McKenna Falls, chlorine is stored at the facility in quantities (approximately 8,000 pounds) that exceed the threshold quantity specified by EPA regulations.  McKenna Falls has one covered process that requires compliance with Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation.\n\nB.

Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the EPA RMP regulations McKenna Falls performed the following offsite consequence analyses:\n\n- One worst-case release scenario for chlorine.\n- One alternate release scenario for chlorine.\n \n D.     Five-year Accident History\n \n Under the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, McKenna Falls has had no releases that meet these requirements.\n \n \n E.     Prevention Program Elements\n \n Management System - McKenna Falls has a management program that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to a qualified individual or position of responsibility.  It clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for any elements where responsibilities are delegated.\n \n \n Process Safety Information - Process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process, including the following information:\n -  MSDS for chlorine that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n- Block flow diagrams for the covered process. \n- Process chemistry and maximum intended inventory data for the covered process.\n- "

The PHA was performed using the What-If method.  The PHA identified the hazards associated with chlorine and the covered process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and resolved in a timely manner.  The PHA will be revalidated and updated once every five years following completion of the initial PHA.\n \n Operating Procedures - Operating procedures have been developed for the chlorine process. \n \n Training - New employees working with a covered process will receive initial training in accordance with 40 Part CFR 68.71.  The training will include an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown.  Those employees already involved in operating or maintaining a covered process prior to 21 June 1999 have certified in writing as having \"the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as specified in the operating procedures.\"\n \n Refresher training will be provided at a minimum of once every three years but generally occurs annually to all employees involved in working with a covered process.

Maintenance, inspection and testing procedures and frequencies are consistent with applicable manufacturer's recommendations and follow accepted engineering practices.  \n \n Management of Change (MOC) - A written MOC procedure has been developed to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and operating procedures for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.75.  The MOC procedure does not apply to \"replacements in kind\" which are defined as replacements that satisfy the original design specifications (e.g., replace a pressure reducing valve with a new identical valve supplied by the original equipment manufacturer).\n \n Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - A PSSR will be performed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.77 for new covered processes and for modified covered processes when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  \n \n Compliance Safety Audits - RMProgram compliance will be confirmed through safety audits that are performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.79.  The audits will be completed by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  A report of the findings will be generated following the audit, and all deficiencies and/or recommendations will be promptly addressed and the resolution is documented.  The two most recent safety audit reports will be maintained at the Water Resources Division Office.\n \n Incident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been developed in accordance with 40 CFR Part 68.81 in response to any incident involving a covered process that did"

The program covers all contractors performing maintenance or repair, turnaround, major renovation, or specialty work on or adjacent to a covered process. The safety performance of each contractor will be evaluated prior to selection.   Each contractor employee will be informed of the known potential toxic release hazards related to work on a covered process as well as the relevant provisions of the emergency response program.  Procedures are in place to control the entrance, presence, and exit of contract employees in covered process areas.  Periodically, the performance of the contract owner or operator will be evaluated while working in or adjacent to a covered process.\n \n F.  Emergency Response Program\n \n McKenna Falls employees will respond only to incidental releases of chlorine where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel.  For non-incidental releases McKenna Falls will rely on outside responders.  Therefore, McKenna Falls has coordinated response actions with the City of Bremerton Fire Department and the PSNS HazMat Response Team and ensured that appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for response.\n \n \n G.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n Since the Last RMP submittal in 1999, Brmerton has implemented a computerized maintenance management program to schedule and track maintenance activities. Training is conducted more often than requred and several videos on chlorine safety and crane operation have been purchased and viewed by operations personnel.
