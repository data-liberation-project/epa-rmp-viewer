We are dedicated to protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors as well as the environment at our site and in our community.  Our goal is always zero incidents.\r\nWe use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nThe Clariant Louisville West Plant manufactures customized precipitated catalysts and catalyst\r\ncarriers. They are used in various industries to aid in the manufacture of other products.  They set in motion a desired chemical reaction or process using much less energy than otherwise needed and minimizes the output of waste and greenhouse gases.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the use of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a chemical regulated by the EPA. Titanium tetrachloride is used by plastic resin manufacturers to more efficiently make polypropylene which is used to makes plastics that go into many useful consumer products, including car bumpers, bicycles, medical devices and toys.  The process is comprised of interconnected units including the tank farm and production process.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nClariant takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous\r\nchemicals.  We used multiple layers of protection to avoid hazards, with each layer adding additional layers of safety.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful process safety programs including:\r\nEmployee participation: Employees are highly trained.  Control room operators constantly monitor the systems and respond quickly.\r\nProcess safety information: Complete and accurate informatio"
