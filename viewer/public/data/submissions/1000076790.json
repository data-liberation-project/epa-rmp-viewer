Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source \n\n\n\nLineage Logistics has a long standing commitment to worker, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Agua Mansa, is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Compliance Department that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance. \n\n  \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics - Agua Mansa is located at 2063 W. Miguel Bustamante Parkway in Colton, California. The facility is situated approximately 1.9 miles northwest of Highway 215 and 2 miles south of Interstate 10. \n\n\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light industrial and residential areas.  \n\nThe facility was constructed and began operations in 2014.\n\n  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Agua Mansa, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance i"
