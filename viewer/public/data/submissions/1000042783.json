This commitment is supported by its Code of Ethical Conduct and policies on Business Ethics, Workplace Health and Safety, and Environmental Law Compliance and Management.  All divisions of BASF actively support these policies. \r\n\r\nThe BASF - Evans City Site is located in Butler County at 1424 Mars-Evans City Road between Mars and Evans City, Pennsylvania.  A small portion of the facility lies within the Borough of Callery; the majority is within Forward Township.  BASF owns approximately 102 acres but only 30 acres have been developed for commercial use.  The facility was purchased from Mine Safety Appliances Company (MSA) in September 2003.  \r\n\r\nEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, 40 CFR Part 68, also known as the Risk Management Program, were created to reduce the probability and severity of accidental releases and to stimulate dialogue between industry and the public to improve accident prevention and response.  In an effort to better educate the community, BASF has presented a summary of the Evans City Site Risk Management Program to the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), local firefighters, the Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Committee, and its own employees.  This written summary should also help other members of the community understand BASF's Risk Management Program. \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nBASF manufactures a range of chemicals based on alkali metal chemistry and boron hydride chemistry.  Its products are used in the pharmaceutical and electronics industries.  Boron trifluoride (BF3), Chemical Abstract Services Registry Number 7637-07-2 is the only substance used at the Evans City Site in quantities above the Risk Management Program regulated threshold quantity.  That regulatory threshold is 5,000 pounds for BF3.  BASF receives BF3 in specially constructed,"

At the time of the original RMP submittal in 1999 up to 22,000 pounds of BF3 were on site at any one-time.  BASF through improved inventory control has reduce the maximum quantity to 16,000 pounds.  The BF3 is directly piped to BASF's process which is standard industry practice.\r\n\r\nBF3 is commonly used throughout the world to manufacture synthetic motor oils, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and flavors and fragrances.  BASF uses it to manufacture diborane, which is a basic boron chemical.\r\n\r\nOther materials listed by EPA in 40 CFR Part 68 are purchased, stored and consumed in quantities below their threshold quantities.  BASF has a procedure to limit the amount of these materials purchased and stored onsite such that they will not exceed these thresholds.\r\n\r\nRelease Scenario\r\n\r\nEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require the preparation of a worst case and an alternate (or more likely) case scenario for the release of the regulated substances.  These updated release scenarios were prepared in May of 2014 by BASF Corporate Ecology Group,  with PHAST 6.7.01.  The PHAST model is capable of modeling dispersions of high pressure releases of heavier than air gases, such as BF3.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario involves the catastrophic failure of one of the high pressure tubes on the BF3 trailer, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of BF3 gas over a 10 minute period.  The alternative scenario involves the occurrence of a 1/4 inch diameter hole in the unloading line from the tube trailer to the first pressure regulator in the facility's BF3 system.  The result would be a release of 2,000 pounds of BF3 over a 30 minute time period.  It is assumed that it would take BASF personnel 30 minutes to detect the release and close the remote shut-off valve on the tube trailer.  By procedure, BF3 is neve"

The Plan is reviewed and updated frequently.  It details responsibilities and actions to be taken by facility personnel as well as by outside response organizations.  The facility has its own Emergency Response Team.  They, along with community firefighters, emergency medical services, HazMat Teams, and the LEPC have been trained to handle and to respond to a release of BF3 by the manufacturer of BF3.  In addition, they have held their own practice drills.  BASF works closely with the LEPC and other community responders to prepare and pre-plan for proper response.\r\n\r\nThe proper response to a release of BF3, which is a corrosive gas and will produce a white cloud, is to hit it with water spray in order to prevent its off-site migration by knocking down the cloud.  If the BF3 cannot be controlled this way, it will eventually react with moisture in the atmosphere or be diluted enough in the air so that it is no longer a hazard.\r\n\r\nBASF has a Community Alert System (siren and community education program) 1998.  BASF maintains this equipment and the community education program element.  For a release of BF3 with off-site consequences, the proper community response is to shelter in place to prevent exposure to the material.  If needed, the siren would be used to alert the community to shelter in place and take proper precautions.  An all-clear signal will let the community know that the emergency is over.  Information on the alert system has been distributed to those in the community within the audible range of the siren.  Drills are conducted monthly.  The alert system may also be activated for weather emergencies at the request of the Butler County EMA Director.\r\n\r\nIf the Community Alert System is activated, BASF will also call 911 to activate the off-site response plan developed by BASF and the LEPC.
