Emergency Response Program - Our emergency response is to utilize an on-site chlorine scrubber which is activated when a chlorine leak is detected and is able to consume a one ton chlorine cylinder within 25 minutes.  Water Treatment staff is also trained and ready to respond to chlorine leaks by activation of the emergency plan, which includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division, which activates the Local emergency Operations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any potentially affected neighbors.  Norfolk Fire Division is a member of the Elkhorn Valley LEPC, which assists with contacting ChemTrec and other agencies that initiates response from a HAZMAT team.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety - We will keep up with the latest technology for safe chlorine use and update procedures as needed.\n\n7.

This includes the West Water Treatment Plant located at 300 South 49th Street and the East\nWater Treatment Plant located at 111 South 1st Street.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy - Water staff is trained on safe chlorine operating and handling procedures.  Staff also performs preventive maintenance and monthly checks on the chlorination, scrubber, and leak detection systems.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Norfolk Fire Division, which activates the Local emergency Operations Plan (LEOP) and notifies any potentially affected neighbors.  Norfolk Fire Division is a member of the Elkhorn Valley LEPC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance - The West Water Treatment Plant uses chorine as a disinfectant.  We have a\none ton chlorine cylinder on line at all times and will have as many as three additional one ton cylinders on\nhand at any given time for a total of four one ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.  Worse Case Scenario - A possible broken cylinder valve on a one ton chlorine cylinder will release\nchlorine and can travel a distance of 1.3 miles.  If this type of leakage would occur we would activate the\nemergency response team to protect the residents in the affected area.  Next step would be to notify Chem\nTrec response team.\n\n    Alternative Release Scenario - A leaking lead gasket that seals an attached line onto the regulator could\npossibly release a chlorine vapor cloud at 15 lbs. per minute and can travel a distance of 0.10 miles.  The\nchlorine cylinders are housed inside a concrete building and are monitored with chlorine gas detectors\nwhich activate the chlorine scrubber when chlorine gas is detected at 1.5 parts per million.  If this type of\nscenario would occur our trained staff and associated scrubber can mitigate the off site\nconsequences.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History - We have not had a"
