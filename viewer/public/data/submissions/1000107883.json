As part of Lubrizol\u0092s philosophy, we believe in maintaining the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and community neighbors.\n\nLubrizol emphasizes release prevention but has a well-developed emergency response program for unforeseen incidents.  We have a trained response team on site at all hours ready to respond to a variety of emergencies.  Lubrizol is a founding member of Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA), the largest chemical plant mutual aid organization in the world.  We also work closely with our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Community Advisory Council (CAC).  \n\nLubrizol is active with the American Chemistry Council (ACC)\u0092s Responsible Care Program as well as the ACC and the Texas Chemical Council\u0092s Process Safety Committees.  Lubrizol Deer Park has hosted three of the ACC Regional Process Safety Committee\u0092s meetings this year (2023).\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Lubrizol Deer Park plant manufactures specialty chemical additives for lubricating oils used in gasoline and diesel engines, automatic transmissions, gear drives, marine engines, and tractors.  RMP covered materials include chlorine, 2-methylpropene, isobutane, propylene oxide, 1,3-butadiene, pentane, boron trifluoride, and a flammable refrigerant.\n\nChlorine, used in our 198 and SCL-IOB/SCL processes, is received by pipeline.  Chlorine reacts rapidly and is only found in trace amounts in our products.\n\n2-methylpropene is used in our Poly, SCL-IOB/SCL, and PB3 processes to manufacture lubricant int"

The 2-methylpropene is reacted in our processes and the remaining isobutane is then returned to the supplier also by pipeline.  We have on-site storage capability for isobutane and 2-methylpropene but currently have no inventory.\n\nPentane is a covered flammable used in the manufacture of intermediates for lubricant blends.  Lubrizol has on-site storage of this material.\n\nPropylene oxide is used in the manufacture of additives for the lubricant industry.  It is received in rail cars and stored on-site.\n\n1,3-butadiene is used in the manufacture of extreme pressure and corrosion inhibitors for the lubricant industry.  It is received in rail cars and fed directly to a reactor where it is fully consumed.\n\nBoron trifluoride is a catalyst used in the manufacture of lubricant intermediates.  The material is received and stored in tube trailers.  The catalyst is fed directly to the reactor with unconsumed catalyst neutralized downstream of the reactor.\n\nA covered, flammable refrigerant (business confidential) is also used in one of the processes to make lubricant intermediates.  This material is in an enclosed refrigeration system and is not consumed in the chemical process.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol maintains an excellent emergency response program in addition to good communication with neighboring chemical plants through CIMA and the community through the LEPC and CAC.  Lubrizol is a member of the East Harris County Manufacturer\u0092s Association (EHCMA) and can post community notifications through its CAER (Community Awareness & Emergency Notification) system.  We also have direct hot lines for emergency contact with our neighbors Shell and Oxychem.\n\nFor new facilities a"

The plant has developed a multi-disciplinary set of Texas Standards for engineering, design, and construction to follow when industry standards are not available.\n\nContractor craftsmen working at the Deer Park facility must receive training from the Houston Area Contractors\u0092 Safety Council (HACSC).  This training must include site specific hazards and emergency procedures for the Deer Park site.\n\nSafe Work Permits are required for any work at Deer Park.  Special training is required for operators and foreman who can approve Hot Work, Confined Space, and Line Opening permits.  These processes are audited regularly to maintain compliance.  \n\nDeer Park follows a Management of Change (MOC) process requiring review and approval for any process changes planned.  This review includes a multi-disciplinary group to ensure all hazards are addressed before the work can proceed.  All MOCs require a Pre-Startup Safety Review to go over the construction and assure that it meets requirements before it can be placed into service.\n\nAll processes have written operating procedures.  These procedures include the chemical hazards, operating limits, and the consequences of deviation from those limits.  Operators have regular refresher training as well as training on any changes that occur as part of the MOC process. \n\nLubrizol recently implemented a Human Performance Initiative (HPI) process to improve employee engagement by documenting individual safe work practices and opportunities for improving those practices.  Employees are encouraged to make regular submittals and to recognize fellow employees for working safely.  To-date, all Lubrizol employees have HPI access via apps on desktops and through phone/tablets. Monthly data is tracked at the corporate level through power bi and engagement rates are also published by si"

Boron trifluoride trailers are kept in an enclosed building with restricted access and vent scrubbing capability in the event of a tube leak.  The scrubbing system is designed to neutralize an entire leaking tube.  2\u00ac-methyl-propene and isobutane are covered under monthly/quarterly fugitive emissions monitoring.  \n\nThe Poly and PB3 units also have emergency flares to burn off excess materials during an upset condition.  Both units have multiple flammable gas detectors that alarm aurally in the unit and in the control room.  These units also have extensive sprinkler, deluge, and fire water curtain systems that are zoned for individual activation points along with a single emergency shutdown that closes off all feeds to the unit.\n\nFor chlorine, Lubrizol follows The Chlorine Institute recommended practices for safe handling.  Emergency reliefs are routed to a containment system with scrubber to prevent release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  The chlorine lines contain expansion bottles to allow for thermal expansion if liquid chlorine is trapped in the piping.  These units have numerous chlorine detectors and alarms to alert operators in the event of a leak.  All chlorine systems also have emergency shutdown stations located throughout the unit in case of leak detection.\n\nFive Year Accident History: \n----------------------------------------\n\nThere have been no releases of RMP covered chemicals at Lubrizol\u0092s Deer Park facility that had an adverse impact on the community.  There have been no incidents in the past five years that would trigger the RMP reporting requirements.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLubrizol has a very active Emergency Preparedness Program with teams on site 24 hours a day.

Emergency response personnel at Lubrizol\u0092s Deer Park facility receive over 1000 aggregate hours of training annually.  Lubrizol uses the NIMS Incident Command System with documented emergency response procedures.\n\nThe Deer Park plant has an Emergency Alert System, and all employees are trained on emergency reporting and shelter-in-place.  Regular drills are conducted on site, with our mutual aid organization and our Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Lubrizol utilizes the E-Merge/E-Notify and CAER platforms for industrial neighbor and community notifications.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrently we have a project in design to install permanent storage for butyl acrylate, a reactive monomer.  This storage will allow redundant temperature monitoring, an emergency short stop inhibitor addition system, and other safety features.\n\nThe Process Safety group has facilitated hazard reviews for areas of the plant that are not covered by the RMP and PSM regulations.  Since 2018, we have completed five of the seven areas, identifying several potential improvements.  These last two remaining areas are planned for completion in 2024.\n\nFor personal safety improvements, the site continues to perform daily site walks with targeted focus areas and processes.  In addition to this, we are also improving the contractor safety program and auditing performances by conducting bi-weekly meetings and daily tasks focusing on continuous improvement."
