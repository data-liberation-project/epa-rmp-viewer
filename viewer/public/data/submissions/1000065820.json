      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary \r\n\r\nKinder Morgan Southeast Terminals, LLC (KMST) - Charlotte #2 Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Blending System, including the associated piping and two 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels.  KMST owns the real property associated with the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer Partners owns all the equipment associated with the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer Partners and KMST each have operational responsibilities for the Butane Blending System. Energy Transfer Partners controls and monitors all butane blending operations remotely from its control center located near Houston, Texas, conducts all maintenance activities, and schedules the delivery of butane trucks.  KMST oversees the unloading of butane trucks into both storage vessels and conducts routine visual inspections.\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer Partners constructed the Butane Blending System in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code No. 58 (2011 Edition) for liquefied petroleum gas operations.  Energy Transfer Partners designed, constructed, and maintains the Butane Blending System in accordance with NFPA No. 58 and the manufacturers' instructions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is the Parties' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the Parties' policy to notify the Charlotte Fire Department as well as the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management Office.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the local Emergency Management Services and the Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy Hospital which is the nearest full service hospital/emergency department.\r\n\r\nThe Charlotte #2 Butane Blending System worst-case scenario is the failure of one of the System's 60,000 gallon butane storage vessels (approximately 250,000 pounds of butane) and the resulting vapor cloud explosion."

      "SummaryText": "The System's alternate (potential off-site impact) release scenario is a pipe release from the truck offloading line (approximately 79,000 pounds of butane) and the resulting vapor cloud explosion.\r\n\r\nThe Parties comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and associated 14 elements (29 CFR Part 1910.119), and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.  This facility has not had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Butane Blending System, it is the Parties' policy to initially contact the owner of the equipment, Energy Transfer Partners, and the local fire department.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the local fire department.  The Charlotte Fire Department personnel have participated in the initial RMP/PSM training session for this system.\r\n\r\nProcess safety controls include excess flow valves, low melting point pneumatic feed lines to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm and 90% ESD actuation) on the vessels, emergency shut-off devices on the system, line thermal/hydrostatic reliefs, and grounding interlock devices.  Note: In contrast to the PSM requirements, this \"stationary source\" as defined under 40 CFR Part 68 is bounded by the off-load station and the points of injection. \r\n\r\nThe Parties actively seek employee input on process safety improvements.  Additionally, the Charlotte Fire Department is contacted regarding participation in site emergency response drills. Additional actions include consolidating separate system inspection checklists for ease of completion."
