      "SummaryText": "The facility name is City of Borger Wastewater Treatment Facility.  The facility is located at 1302 W. Third Street, Borger, Texas, 79007.  Approximately 4,000 Lbs. of chlorine in two one ton cylinders is stored at the site.\n     The facility has a Chlorine Handling and Emergency Response Procedures Manual for use as a guideline.  Employees who handle chlorine have training which is either provided on site or obtained through association schools.  The City of Borger is very safety conscious regarding chlorine.\n     The worst case scenario would occur if a 2,000 Lb. cylinder were to suddenly rupture.  The vapor cloud would be directed toward Borger Senior High School, which is approx. 1/2 mile away.  The building in which the cylinders are stored would hopefully contain the spill long enough to permit evacuation of the affected area.  \n     The alternative worst case scenario would occur if a fusable plug or valve should rupture.  The vapor cloud would not reach any populated areas.  The Borger Fire Department has a B kit which could be used to seal the rupture.\n     To prevent accidental releases, the facility has implemented an operator training program to minimize the risk of an accidental discharge due to operator error.  The facility also has an inspection schedule to reduce the risk of a discharge due to faulty equipment. \n     There have been no chlorine related accidents at the facility in the past five years.\n     The emergency response program is in the hands of the Hutchinson County Emergency Planning Committee.  They have an evacuation plan in place.\n     There are no planned changes in the safety program at this time."
