FACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE POLICY\n\n\n\nThe owners, management, and the employees of Blue Star Gas - Redding, Co are committed to the\n\nprevention of any accidental release of propane. If an accidental release should occur, the company\n\nis prepared to notify and work with the local responders, or other authorities, to mitigate any release\n\nand to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. A detailed emergency\n\nresponse plan has been developed and would be implemented by the facility management in the\n\nevent of an accidental release of our product.\n\n\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe primary business of the facility is the storage and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas\n\n(propane).  Access to the site is restricted to authorized personnel. This facility was determined to\n\nmeet the RMP program (3) criteria.\n\n\n\n3.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA'S accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state, and local\n\ncodes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance\n\nwith NFPA-58 and state law and the uniform fire code standard 82.\n\n\n\n4.    WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nFailure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount (85 %) at (60 deg f) would\n\nresult in a vapor cloud explosion. It is assumed that the entire tank contents are released as a\n\nvapor, which finds an ignition source. 10 percent of the release quantity is assumed to participate in\n\na resulting explosion. The endpoint used is 1-PSI OVERPRESSURE. According to EPA'S\n\nreference tables or equations, the distance to the endpoint is .04 miles. There is an estimated\n\nresidential population of 40 people within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\n5.    FIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or accidents involving propane in the past five years that\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property da"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the local fire\n\ndepartment, or other authorities, to request a response to the emergency. We have discussed this\n\npolicy with the local fire department, and other authorities, to coordinate such a response.\n\n\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSafety is an on- going process at the facility and the periodic evaluations are preformed to assess\n\nthe maintenance of safe conditions. Employees at the facility receive training on safety, proper\n\nloading and unloading procedures, and of the emergency shut-off switches/ valves and procedures\n\nfor closing such switches/ valves in the event of an accidental release of propane.\n\n\n\nEPA FACILITY ID: 100000240474 Blue Star Gas - Redding, Co.
