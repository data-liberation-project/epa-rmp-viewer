All employees at DVWTP are trained in chlorine\r\n     containment procedures and all are trained in the use of SCBA equipment.\r\n\r\n     2.   TYPES OF EMERGENCY\r\n\r\n               a.   Chlorine Release\r\n          \r\n          In the event of an equipment or human failure, potential sources for chlorine releases are:\r\n\r\n                         1.   One Ton chlorine Container\r\n                         2.   Chlorine supply lines and chlorination equipment.\r\n                    \r\n          At this facility, the loss of any utilities including electricity will not increase the potential\r\n     for a chlorine release.\r\n\r\n     3.   SCOPE\r\n          \r\n          The scope of this plan includes:\r\n\r\n               a.   A chlorine release contained within the plant facilities and controllable  by\r\n          CUWCD personnel and equipment.\r\n          \r\n               b.   A chlorine release affecting or with the potential to affect the area surrounding the\r\n          CUWCD; such a release would require outside assistance.\r\n\r\n     4.   PLANNING FOR HANDLING THE EMERGENCY\r\n\r\n          Responsibility:\r\n\r\n          The Plant Manager is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the plan.  He is\r\n     responsible for k"

If it is anticipated that a release\r\n     cannot be soon contained or is of a massive quantity, the evacuation option should be\r\n     utilized.
