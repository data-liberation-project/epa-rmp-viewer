Since the refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Sunview Vineyards has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Sunview Cold Storage has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration process, established procedures to conduct a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration process on a daily basis, Sunview Cold Storage has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration process is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage emphas safe and environmentally sound operating practices through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  While it is Sunview Cold Storage's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Sunview Cold Storage, Pond facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\n\n\nSunview Cold Storage has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, Sunview Cold Storage audits these p"

Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides cooling for the Sunview Cold Storage Pond facility.  The cold storage plant was originally constructed in 1995 and the last expansion of the facility occurred in 1997.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system at the Sunview Cold Storage Pond facility provides cooling to 9 pre-cool and cold storage rooms.  The engine room has an indoor high pressure receiver that supplies liquid ammonia to flooded evaporators in the pre-cool and cold storage rooms.  During normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be ?pumped down? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the indoor high pressure receiver is 12,500 pounds. \n\n\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being implemented by Sunview Vineyards to address the anhydrous ammonia system at the Sunview Cold Storage Pond facility.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nWritten process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHA) have been completed and will be updated "

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Sunview Cold Storage employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program,Sunview Cold Storage regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, Sunview Cold Storage does not have any changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia-based refrigeration system to improve safety."
