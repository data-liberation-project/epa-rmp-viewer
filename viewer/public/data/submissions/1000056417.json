Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Grapeman Delano Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Grapeman Delano Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Grapeman Delano Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical  | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia   30,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM regulation to m"

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nGrapeman Delano operates a commercial cold storage for table grapes in Delano, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following: (9) Rooms (6) Precool Rooms (1) Hallway.\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within, directly above, or outside the machinery room. \n\n\n\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia evaporates to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves "

The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm and strobe. Also, a sampling system is installed in each refrigerated area that provides two-minute interval monitoring. The sampling system is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Grapeman Delano consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Grapeman Delano is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nGrapeman Delano Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Grapeman Delano Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammoni"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nGrapeman Delano Cold Storage has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Grapeman Delano Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Grapeman Delano Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Grapeman Delano Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nGrapeman Delano Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Grapeman Delano Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Grapeman Delano Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
