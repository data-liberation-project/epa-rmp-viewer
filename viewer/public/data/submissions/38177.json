A brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented include:\n\n(1)  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation.\n(2)  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n(3)  A five-year history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated b EPA?s RMP rule\n(4)  An overview of our emergency response program\n(5)  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n(6)  The certification that EPA?s RMP program requires us to provide.\n(7)  The data elements about our risk management program\n\n\n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces specialty chemicals.  These chemicals are used in a variety of applications in the food, powdered metal, personal care, and water treatment industries, to name a few.  This facility uses a variety of processing operations and equipment.  \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:  chlorine, formaldehyde, ethylene oxide, and ethylenediamine.  Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n3.0  OVERVIEW OF ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidenta"

There have been not been any significant releases in the past five years.   \n\n\n5.0  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.  We also installed an emergency siren located on the eastern edge of the plant boundary to quickly notify our closest neighbors in the event of an accidental release. \n\nWe have a trained emergency response team on site that meets and trains on a monthly basis.   If necessary,  we coordinate with Williamsport Area Fire Department for handling larger emergency incidents.  Our emergency response team has incident command, fire, and HAZMAT training and drills with the Lycoming County LEPC.\n\n\n6.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nLonza, Inc. subscribes to the SOCMA, which pr"
