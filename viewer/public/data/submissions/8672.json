DESIGNED FOR THE PROCESSING OF SWEET CORN,WHICH IS HARVESTED,PROCESSED AND FROZEN IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER OF EACH YEAR. THE FACILITIES ALSO INCLUDE COLD STORAGE  AREA.\n     THE AMMONIA REFRIGERATION SYSTEM WAS ALSO NEW IN 1998 AND IS CONSIDERED STATE OF THE ART. HIGH EFFICIENCY SCREW COMPRESSORS AND TOP QUALITY COMPONENTS WERE USED THROUGHOUT. THE MAJORITY OF THE REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT IS SUPPORT  FOR FRESH PACK OPERATIONS LASTING 6-8WEEKS PER YEAR. AFTER WHICH THE AMMONIA IS PUMPED BACK TO HOLDING VESSELS  UNTIL REQUIRED THE NEXT SEASON . 15% OF THE REFRIGERATION EQUIPMENT IS ON LINE TO SUPPORT COLD STORAGE OPERATIONS 12 MONTHS EACH YEAR. APPROXIMATELY 36,000 LBS OF AMMONIA IS ON SITE FOR OUR OPERATIONS.  PER THE MECHANICAL CODE OUR REFRIGERATION SPACES ARE MONITORED BY AMMONIA DETECTION SYSTEMS,WITH AUDIO AND VISUAL ALARMS,CENTRAL STATION MONITORING,AND AUTOMATIC EXHAUST SYSTEMS INTERLOCKED TO SHUNT BREAKERSWHICH ISOLATE  PROTECTED SPACES FROM ELECTRICALY INDUCED EXPLOSION. A 15,000 GAL. WATER TANK IS PIPED TO ALL RELIEF VALVES  IN CASE OF OVERPRESSURIZATION  AND SUBSIQUENT RELIEF VALVE VENTING.\n    OUR OPERATIONS STAFF CONSISTS OF THREE OPERATING ENGINEERS TRAINED IN THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE  OF ALL REFRIGERATION AND BOILER EQUIPMENT. THEIR EMERGENCY RESPONSE EQUIPMENT INCLUDES RADIOS,SCBA'S CANNISTER MASKS CLASS A SUITS AND MONITORS.\n     OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING ARE ON GOING YEAR ROUND. OFFSITE SAFETY TRAINING IS UTILIZED WHEN AVAILABLE.\n     THIS PLANT HAS DOCUMENTED PROCEEDURES COVERING THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF AMMONIA ON SITE. THIS IS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE  \"PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT\" PROGRAM AS DICTATED BY WAC296-67-013.
