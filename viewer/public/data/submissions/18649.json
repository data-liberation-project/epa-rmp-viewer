      "SummaryText": "The Rexnord Corporation, Link-Belt Bearing Division (Rexnord) facility is located 7601 Rockville Road, Indianapolis, Indiana.  Rexnord maintains on site four (4) propane tanks, two with a maximum capacity of 30,000 gallons (127,500 pounds) each and two with a maximum capacity of 12,000 gallons (51,000 pounds) each. Propane is a listed flammable substance under the Risk Management Plan regulations found at 40 CFR 68 and is subject to those regulations since it is stored in quantities in excess of 10,000 pounds. It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the personal health of Rexnord employees as well as to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is the Rexnord's policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which Rexnord handles propane combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of Rexnord personnel.\n\nThe emergency response program at this facility is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook, \"Guidelines for Developing Plant Emergency Procedures\" and \"How to Control LP-Gas Leaks and Fires\". The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors."
