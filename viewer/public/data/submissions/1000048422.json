      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe Turnpike Wastewater Reclamation Facility (Wastewater Reclamation Facility), owned and operated by the City of Leesburg is a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) wastewater treatment plant.  An integral component of the treatment plant is chlorine (Cl2) used for wastewater disinfection.  The Cl2 storage capacity of the facility is 14,000 pounds.  This inventory exceeds the 2,500-pound threshold for Cl2 set by EPA under the Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule codified at 40 CFR 68.  Pursuant to the requirements of the rule, the City of Leesburg has prepared this Risk Management Program (RMP) Plan. We are proud of our environmental, health, and safety efforts and programs and our record in these areas.  The following sections outline our RMP plan.   \n\n\n\nOVERALL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n\n\nThe Plant Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, the Plant Manager has assumed the role of RMP Coordinator.  The RMP Coordinator has the responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the EPA RMP elements.  In addition, the RMP Coordinator works closely with the Chief Operator at the Wastewater Reclamation Facility to integrate the elements of OSHA's PSM program (where applicable) as required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule.  \n\n\n\nThe RMP Coordinator serves as the chairman of the facility's RMP Steering Committee.  This committee comprises members with responsibilities for developing and managing specific elements of our risk management and process safety programs.  The members of this committee are assigned by the Plant Manager.  Currently, the members of the RMP Steering Committee include the following: \n\n\n\n *  RMP Coordinator (The Plant Manager)\n\n *  Chief Operator of t"

The Plant Manager also is responsible for ensuring that the accident history for each covered process is appropriately documented and maintained in accordance with Section 68.42 and 68.168 of the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nThe rule requires the evaluation of a worst case scenario, though the likelihood of the occurrence of such a scenario may be extremely small.  The worst case scenario has been defined as a catastrophic release of one entire Cl2 tank containing 2,000 pounds.  The distance to the toxic endpoint as predicted by the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plant Reference Tables is 2.3 miles.  At this distance, residences, recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas, and a wildlife sanctuary appear to be vulnerable.  In addition to the worst case scenario, an alternative release scenario has been modeled employing more appropriate meteorological conditions and release assumptions.  In the alternative release scenario, 4.95 pounds of Cl2 per minute are assumed to be released as a result of a piping leak or valve failure.  A 15-minute release would be expected in such a scenario.  Based upon these assumptions, the distance to the endpoint as predicted by the RMP Guidance is 0.1 miles (528 feet).  At this distance, no residences, schools, recreational areas or environmental receptors appear to be vulnerable.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDE"
