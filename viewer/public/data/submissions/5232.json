Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Calhoun and Charleston Fire Departments which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled    \nOur facility's primary activities encompass Pulp and Paper Manufacturing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine dioxide and Chlorine Ton Cylinders.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine dioxide is used as a bleaching agent for pulp.  Chlorine is used as a disinfection for drinking water.  \nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine dioxide at our facility is 13,553 lbs., while Chlorine is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 lbs.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in two tanks in a solution of 10 grams per liter.  Chlorine is stored in 1 ton cylinders.  \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario    \nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario - Chlorine Dioxide\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Chlorine Dioxide Plant.  The scenario involves t"

All of the tanks liquid is assumed to be immediately release to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 14 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L. \n\nWorst Case Scenario - Chlorine\nThe worst cases release scenario involves a catastrophic release of Chlorine from the Filter Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine from a 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of  1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (Chlorine dioxide)\n\nAn alternative release scenario for Chlorine dioxide involves a release from one of the tanks at the Chlorine Dioxide Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of  33 lbs. of Chlorine dioxide.  After performing maintenance to replace a section of the solution line a 75 horsepower motor with a 400 gallon/min. capacity was restarted.  Ten minutes after the pump was started, a leak was found from a flange on the section of the pipe.   The pump was immediately shutdown.  Solution from the process line spilled to the ground at a rate of 3.3 lbs./min.  The release formed a pool and it is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance at 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (Chlorine)\n\nAn alternative release scenario for chlorine involves the release from one of the 1-ton cylinders at our water treatment plant.  The scenario involves a leak occurring where the portable tank is connected to the chlorine system.  The system is equipped with a chlorine gas detector which would aler"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements  of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.       \n\nProcess Safety Information\nBowater Newsprint and Directory Division maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis    \nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of time/period.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Bowater Newsprint and Directory Division maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, tem"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety    \nBowater Newsprint and Directory Division is always seeking ways to improve their overall safety program.  Any findings or developments resulting from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program will be implemented as soon as practical.  \n\nBy September 1, 1999, we will be replacing our Chlorine dioxide tanks that currently do not have secondary containment, with a larger tank that will have containment.  This containment system will also be equipped with a gas detection system, remote cameras and a foam suppression system.\n\nUsing EPA's DEGADIS model, the passive containment; i.e. dike, would reduce a catastrophic release toxic endpoint to 7.7 miles.  Assuming a 90% reduction for the foam suppression system, the toxic endpoint drops to 0.9 miles.\n\n8.
