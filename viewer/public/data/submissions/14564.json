Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, Arsine is manufactured, purified, and repackaged.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these products combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation and the CGA COMPGEAP Program defined by NFPA 472. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing, purification, and fill of Arsine.  Arsine is manufactured under vacuum by the addition of water and acid onto an Arsenic compound.  Crude Arsine gas is evolved, collected, purified, and packaged. Residual gases or vapors are vented to state of the art wet scrubbing systems with 99.97% efficiency.\n\nThe regulated substances handled and triggered at this facility are:\n\n7 Over 1000 pounds of aggregate storage of Arsine gas on the rear loading dock of the facility.  Material throughout the processes does not exceed the TQ.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nBelow is a description of the WCS': \n\n130 lb. release from cylinder over 10 minutes outdoors. With a Toxic Endpoint of 0.0019 mg/L, the Vulnerability Radius for Urban would have off-site impacts \n\nBelow is a description of the ACS':\n\nA 74 lb. release from a pipe indoors over 10 minutes.  Gas detection identifies the situation that occurs in the process room which is ventilated to a scrub"

With a Toxic Endpoint of 0.0019 mg/L, the Vulnerability Radius for Urban would have off-site impacts.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes as well as local BOCA codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nPer the requirements of EPA RMP, there have been no accidents or accidental releases of toxic gases that could have had off-site consequences.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard and the CGA COMPGEAP program defined by NFPA 472.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's Operations Level as a minimum or as a HazMat Technician.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the local municipalities. This includes an aggressive Local Mutual Aid group from surrounding industry and Emergency Services.  Periodic drills are conducted with these groups/agencies to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  The last drill held in 1998.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nSafety and Environmental Protection is of utmost importance to Solkatronic Chemicals, Inc.  Through OSHA regulations as a minimum, the implementation of the CMA Responsible CARE initiative, and excellent Accident Prevention Programs, improvements to Safety is an ongoing continuous improvement process."
