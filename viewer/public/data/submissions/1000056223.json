As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Broin Enterprises (POET Research Center) completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBroin Enterprises is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  Ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation, however it is stored on-site below the applicable RMP threshold and therefore is only evaluated for General Duty. It is the policy of Broin Enterprises (POET Research Center) to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia and denaturant, it is the policy of Broin Enterprises to notify the Scotland Fire Department and Bon Homme County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 30 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 57,500 pounds (total pentane is 17,250 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground"

The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored is only 2,850 pounds (below the RMP threshold quantity).  Broin Enterprises (POET Research Center) has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response program for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Broin Enterprises has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Broin Enterprises(POET Research Center) has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nBroin Enterprises (POET Research Center) does not have a history of accidents of the RMP regulated chemicals which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years."
