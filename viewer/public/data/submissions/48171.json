      "SummaryText": "1.0  Accidental Release Prevention And Response Policies\n    \n    At Stratcor, Inc. (Stratcor), we use anhydrous ammonia (AA) as a reactant in the recovery of vanadium products and chlorine (Cl2) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in the halide manufacturing process. AA, Cl2, and TiCl4 are regulated substances under the Accidental Release Program regulations, which governs the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  Certain safety precautions must be observed when handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to employees and nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, training of our personnel who operate the processes, and the safety devices inherent in the design of their storage vessels. \n    Our emergency response program presents a logical coordinated course of action to be followed in case of an emergency.  The program utilizes information from the Emergency Response Guidebook by the Department of Transportation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.0  Stratcor, Inc. and Regulated Substances\n\n    Our Hot Springs facility includes a vanadium recovery process and a halides manufacturing process. AA is used to aid in the recovery of the vanadium product in a crystallization circuit. Cl2 is introduced into the vanadium halide production process as a reactant. TiCI4 is blended with vanadium oxytrichloride to form vanadium-titanium mixtures.  AA, Cl2, and TiCI4 are the only chemicals that EPA has identified on the RMP Rule Toxic Substances list and that are stored above threshold quantities. Stratcor has no flammable substances regulated by Part 68.  Storage conditions for the toxic chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule by Part 68 are provided in the following table.\n\nTable 1.

U.S. Stratcor's PSM program follows the requirements of the OSHA standards (29 CFR 1910.119) that are given in Part 68. Although the PSM program has been developed to follow the guidelines of the OSHA PSM standard, it should be noted that the Stratcor facility is under the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).The requirements for our prevention program take a proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of regulated substances that pose a danger to human health and the environment. This prevention program is a vital part of our everyday operations as safety is our chief priority. Our program employs high standards and includes the following steps and programs that lead to successful accident prevention: \n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\n    Process safety includes information pertaining to the hazards of the substances in the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process, and information pertaining to the equipment in the process. This information, updated regularly, helps to educate all employees on the current status of covered processes. The chemical hazards of the process chemicals used at the Stratcor facility are covered by the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) program required by"

Recommendations resulting from the PHA are promptly addressed following the completion of the review. The resolutions to the recommendations are performed and documented as soon as possible and a schedule of the completion of all resolutions to recommendations resulting from the PHA is developed and kept on-file in the PSM program with the PHA. \n \n\n3.3    Operating Procedures\n\n    The PSM program has developed and documented procedures for each operating phase of Stratcor's processes covered by the PSM program. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department are kept in the safety office. SOPs are also readily accessible to employees. The SOPs are revised as needed as part of their ongoing review and reflect the most current operating practices of the covered processes. Included in the SOPs are practices for such operations as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, hot work permits, and safe work permits. The SOPs address elements for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. \n\n3.4  Training\n\n    Operating and maintenance personnel at Stratcor, as well as any contract employees, as required by the regulation, must be trained in an overview of the process and in the developed operating procedures. This training must emphasize specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  \n    Initial training must occur before an employee?s assignment to a PSM covered process.

Training documentation indicates whether the employee received and understood the training required by the regulation.\n\n3.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\n    The General Manager is responsible for implementation and adherence to the mechanical integrity program by Stratcor facility personnel and contractors.  The mechanical integrity program for the Stratcor facility is maintained and implemented by the Maintenance and Engineering Department. Stratcor personnel completing inspection, maintenance, and preventive maintenance includes plant technicians, maintenance, and engineering personnel. A level of knowledge of mechanical and electrical equipment, process hazards, and safe work practices is required within the job description and within other elements of the PSM program.\n    Inspection and testing will be documented as described in the mechanical integrity program maintained by the Maintenance and Engineering Department.  Equipment deficiencies found during routine operation, maintenance activities, or tests/inspections will be addressed before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n    The program coincides with our Quality Assurance program and an important element of quality assurance is the consistent use of the Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review.  \n    \n3.6    Management of Change\n\n    The Management of Change (MoC) procedures must address any change other than ?replacement in kind? made in or to a PSM covered process.

The MoC procedures described in the Plant/Process Change Procedure will be utilized as part of the system to manage changes to covered processes. The Plant/Process Change Management Form must be utilized by personnel to document the required MoC information. The information gathered within the form will be kept on file at the Safety Office to track changes completed at the facility.\n\n3.7  Pre-startup Reviews\n\n    Stratcor's Management of Change Equipment Release program also requires that a safety review be performed before any change or modification to a process. This safety review confirms that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; and training of each employee involved in operating a process is complete. \n\n3.8  Compliance Audit\n\n    Compliance with PSM standards will be evaluated at least every three years through a documented audit to verify that the procedures and practices developed under the PSM standard are adequate and being followed.  Deficiencies noted during the audit will be annotated and reported to management.  Progress toward resolving deficiencies will be tracked after a ranking and prioritization of items requiring response.
