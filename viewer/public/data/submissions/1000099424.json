Designing, maintaining and operating equipment, facilities and processes in a safe manner.\n\n\n\n? Using process hazard management systems to prevent hazardous chemical releases or conditions that have the potential to cause fires or explosions.\n\n\n\n? Participating in safety incident and illness investigations, audits and follow-up activities.\n\n\n\nCeradyne Inc. Quapaw Facility and RMP Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nQuapaw purchases and utilizes boron trifluoride (BF3) as a raw material feedstock into its boron isotopic separation process. Boron trifluoride is delivered to the site as a compressed gas in tube trailers consisting of 6 individual tubes, containing 3500 pounds of BF3 gas at a pressure of 1800 psig. The BF3 gas is transferred from a single tube of the tube trailer into the production area; tubes are used sequentially. Quapaw sells isotopically enriched boron trifluoride into global semiconductor markets. Final product gas is stored and transported in portable compressed gas cylinders packaged in accordance with USDOT Hazardous Materials regulations.\n\n\n\nQuapaw maximum BF3 inventory storage, consisting of one to two tube"
