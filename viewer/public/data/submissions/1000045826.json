This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  The Lilly Technology Center has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  Lilly's accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center has an Integrated Contingency Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  This plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additionally, individual business units at the plant maintain local emergency response procedures which focus on the actions of local personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

Through LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\n\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center actively supports community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is bounded by Raymond Street on the South, Harding Street on the West, and Morris Street on the North (plus one property to the north of Morris Street which totals 9 acres); the LTC Site is comprised of 267 total acres.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.

Responsible Care began in 1989 as a collection of management practices that are organized around Codes of Management Practice.  The original code consisted of Community Awareness and Emergency Response and was complemented by five other codes by the end of 1992.  Those five codes are Distribution Safety, Employee Health and Safety, Pollution Prevention, Process Safety and Product Stewardship.  At Lilly our strategy has been to integrate the management practices associated with these 6 codes (there are a total of 106) into our health, safety and environmental management policy and principles as well as our global policy requirements.  Continuous improvement has been driven by annual self-evaluations of the codes. \n\n\n\nA \"new\" Responsible Care was rolled out by the American Chemistry Council in 2001, which responds to both public feedback about the initiative and the changing global economic and socio-political climate.  The \"new\" Responsible Care initiative has resulted in a Responsible Care Management System (RCMS) technical specification, which all member companies must implement and then seek external certification to verify implementation.  Furthermore, an additional Code of Management Practice was added to address chemical security.  As required by the Responsible Care initiative, all affected sites have completed security vulnerability assessments.  As a result of these assessments, action plans were developed to address critical items identified.  Corrective measures have been put into place, and members of local law enforcement were brought in to verify this as a"

The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  It includes response procedures that are applicable for each building/area of the plant.

Within ten minutes it can send a recorded message to everyone who lives or works within one mile of the plant site.  The system calls every number up to three times if there is no answer initially.  It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered.  In conjunction with the Marion County emergency planning organizations, Lilly tests the RN system annually.\n\n\n\nLilly Fire Rescue (LFR)\n\nThe Lilly Indianapolis plant sites have a trained emergency response team, Lilly Fire Rescue (LFR), made up of full time emergency staff and trained extended staff members (volunteers who have other job duties but can be called as needed). LFR is trained as an all hazard response team including Fire, Rescue, HazMat and EMS. LFR will respond to any emergency situation on the plantsite when called. When Security has been notified that an emergency has occurred via telephone (555), radio, alarm or other means, Security dispatches the LFR full time staff along with the LFR extended staff who are in or near the incident area to immediately report to the incident scene to verify that an emergency exists and respond as necessary.  \n\n\n\nLilly Fire Rescue undergoes regular training to meet Local, State, Federal and Company requirements. On-site training facilities and simulators facilitate the training process.  In an emergency situation, one of the site emergency coordinators, or his designate, becomes the incident commander.
