The maximum in inventory of ton cylinder is three with only two cylinder in use at a time.Maximum release of chlorine in case of broken valve or ruptured line would not exceed 4000 pounds at any one time and would affect 500 residents per square mile.Our plan contains procedures for notifying the proper authorities,and those in the immediate vicinity who would need to be evacuated immediately from the area.Through diligence and training we have had no releases and wih none in the future."
