We observe all necessary safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia and propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and propane, the safety devices inherent to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThis facility complies with ANSI K-61.1 and OSHA 1910.111 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local emergency response agency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage.  We receive anhydrous ammonia and propane by transport truck and store it as a liquid in pressurized vessels. Access to the processes is restricted to authorized employees and contractors.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 30,000 gallons (water capacity).  The maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this facility is 46,000 gallons (water capacity).\n\nThe worst case and alternative release scenarios:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (85% @ 60 F), resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 2.41 miles, based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to b"

The operator observes the leak and isolates the hose by closing the shut-off valves.  The contents of the hose are released over a period of ten minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 140 ppm is 317 feet, based on the dense gas dispersion model Degadis.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there is estimated to be 1 resident within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for propane is failure of one 30,000 gallon tank when filled to its maximum allowable capacity (88% @ 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.39 miles, based on the equations in Appendix C of EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are estimated to be 18 residents, commercial/industrial areas and schools within the distance to endpoint.\n\n The alternative release scenario for propane is failure of a 12 foot length of 3 inch hose due to pull-away after loading.  The excess flow valves function to stop the flow.  The contents of the hose are released.  The vapor expands and upon finding an ignition source, it explodes.  The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 111 feet, based on the equations in Appendix C of EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual.  This distance extends beyond the facility boundary and there are no receptors within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI K-61.1,"

The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWe maintain safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our anhydrous ammonia and propane storage facilities.\n\nProcess Hazard Review\nOur Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team conducts comprehensive studies and reviews to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. These activities are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWe maintain written operating procedures for operation of the anhydrous ammonia and propane storage facility.  These procedures address various modes of operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators.\n\nTraining\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years.\n\nMaintenance\nOur EHSS team performs thorough annual maintenance inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Basic visual inspections are performed by facility operators on a more frequent basis during loading and unloading of anhydrous ammonia and propane delivery vehicles.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

These audits are performed at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of anhydrous ammonia or propane.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n\nThis facility has had one accident involving anhydrous ammonia.

This plan addresses chemical inventory, evacuation procedures and instructions for notifying emergency response agencies.  This plan is reviewed on an annual basis and is included in the employee training program.
