      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRalph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Riverside City Fire Department and the Riverside County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our (2) two closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system\u00bfs purposes are to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside processing operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration systems, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case an"

      "SummaryText": "d alternate case release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside RMP Plan on file with the Environmental Affairs Director at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of LANDVIEW VI mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2000 data. \n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nRalph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n- Accident History\n\nThere has been only one ammonia related incident at the Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside facility within the last five years.  This accidental release did not result in any on or off site site property damage or injuries.\n\n - Emergency Action Plan\n\nOur facility has an in-house first responder team that is trained to handle chemical releases and works in cooperation with the City of Riverside Fire Department. Training on emergency response procedures is provided to maintenance engineers upon hiring and refresher courses are provided regularly. The facility maintains a mobile emergency command center that can be used to assist with catastrophic scenarios. A trailer with personal protective equipment (PPE) including Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA\u00bfs) is also located on site and is regularly maintained by the engineering department.  In the event emergency health services are required, trained responders are equipped with basic first aid knowledge and will assist the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services personnel.\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nRalph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside currently has no ch"

However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Ralph\u00bfs Grocery Riverside personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
