The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Pascagoula Gas Plant is coordinated with the Jackson County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The Pascagoula Gas Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Pascagoula Gas Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and will provide periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nEnterprise Products Operating, LLC is committed to the safe design and operation of all of its processing and fractionation plants and liquid hydrocarbon terminals and resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk. \r\n\r\nThe video surveillance system will be upgraded in 2017."

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant (facility or refinery) is located at 6800 Stennis Boulevard; Moss Point, Jackson County, Mississippi 39562. Enterprise Products purchased this facility from BP and assumed operational control of PGP on June 1, 2016. The facility receives raw natural gas from deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and then separates that gas into its components.  The raw natural gas passing through the plant contains the following regulated substances: methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. This natural gas is processed for distribution throughout major pipelines in the Southeast and is provided to customers throughout the Southeast and all along the East Coast.\r\n\r\nDue to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Pascagoula Gas Plant is being registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 3 facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Rel"

The gas processing operations at the Pascagoula Gas Plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant will promptly investigate any incidents that result in or reasonably could result in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develop recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Pascagoula Gas Plant has safety features and controls to help contain/control a release, to quick"
