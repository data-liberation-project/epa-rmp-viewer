THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n    THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF HUMBOLDT-ST.VINCENT ELEV. ARE\nCOMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE\nCOMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE\nRELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n    THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n     THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 420,000 POUNDS IN OUR\n30,000 AND 26,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE\nTHE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\nA.  THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF\nTHE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE\nMAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME\nOF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE\nDISTANCE THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 1.12 MILES.\n\nB.   THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD\nREVEIW IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE\nENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE\nSTORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN\nNATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY\nAND HEALTH ADMIN"
