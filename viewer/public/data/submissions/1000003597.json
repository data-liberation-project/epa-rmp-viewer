It is permitted to treat 20 million gallons of wastewater per day and operates a reuse program that supplies irrigation water to local golf courses and public parks.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJEA's motto is building community and a vital part of that is ensuring the safety of its employees and neighbors.  As a result, operations and maintenance (O&M) and the Field Compliance and Incident Response (FCIR) sections view the upkeep and maintenance of its Risk Management Program as a vital component in sustaining the well being of those in the Arlington East WRF service area.\n\nFacility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Arlington East WRF utilizes a gaseous chlorine system to disinfect its effluent.  In order to discharge into the river, it must pass a rigorous test of various parameters detailed in its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit issued by the local Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) office.  One of those parameters is ensuring that the residual chlorine is decreased sufficiently before discharging into the St. John's River.  Treatment using sulfur dioxide ensures that this is accomplished.   Both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide are delivered to the facility in one ton cylinders.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the process exceed regulatory thresholds and are therefore subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe most advantageous part of the chlorination and de-chlorination system of the facility in terms of safety is the fact that these cylinders are enclosed within a fortified building.  Not only is this building well built and secured, it also is equipped with a scrubber system so that in the event that there is a release, gases would i"

Between this safe layout, preventative maintenance by O&M, and the implementation of the RMP program by FCIR; JEA is able to properly address these safety issues while still providing utility services to the East Arlington Area.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAEWRF has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAEWRF has a plan to contact the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and notify the LEPC in the event of an accidental release.  Personnel onsite will not respond to the release but will evacuate the facility in accordance with the evacuation plan.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAEWRF plans to address action items resulting from the recent PSM/RMP audit and PHAs in order to improve plant safety."
