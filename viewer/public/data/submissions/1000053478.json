The plan has been prepared in accordance with section 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials (AHMs).  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by the AMVAC Chemical Corporation, Axis Plant, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP regulation and the relevent portions of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management regulations.\r\n\r\nThe AMVAC Axis facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Mobile Manufacturing Center.  It was purchased from Dupont by AMVAC on 5-18-2001.  The necessary documentation for the facility to comply with the RMP legislation was a part of that purchase agreement.  All of the Hazard and Operability Studies and Process Hazard Analysies were originally documented by Dupont and they have all been reviewed AMVAC in preparation of this RMP.  The AMVAC Axis plant and the Dupont MMC are on a common site.  All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency teams from both companies.\r\n\r\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nMission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\r\n1.  Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\r\n2.  Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\r\n3.  Operating in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects a high level of concern and respect for the local community.\r\n4.  Investing in its future through aggressive research and development of new products and markets.\r\n5.

Safe conditions and full environmental regulartory compliance will be maintained at all of its facilities.  All unsafe conditions/actions will be immediately corrected and management notified.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Mission Statement:  AMVAC Chemical Corporation's Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) departments are committed to ensuring that facility operations are conducted in full compliance with existing environmental, health and safety regulations.  To achieve this we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\r\n\r\n2.0  Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural pesticides at its plant located at 12650 Hwy. 43 N. In Axis, Alabama.  The facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the Dupont facility located on the common site.  The facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations, peripheral tanks and various ancilliary equipment.\r\nThe AMVAC Axis plant has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing.  The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\r\n\r\nAs per 40 CFR 68.190(b)(4) the RMP must be updated no later than the date on which a regulated substance is first present above a threshold quantity in a process above a threshold quantity. AMVAC plans to begin production of METAM/KPAM in Fall 2008 and two of the raw materials used in this process are covered chemicals. This updated RMP includes information to satisfy this requirement.

Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in Fortress and DCMAA processes\r\n2.  Phosphorous Trichloride, CAS 7719-12-2 used in Fortress and also in K500 processes\r\n3.  Hydrogen Sulfide, CAS 7783-06-4 used in Fortress process (NOTE: This has been removed because it is below threshold)\r\n4.  Bromine, CAS 7726-95-6 used in Dibrom process\r\n5.  Carbon Disulfide, CAS 75-15-0 used in METAM/KPAM process\r\n*Listed Flammable Substances:  \r\n1.  Methylamine, CAS 74-89-5 used in METAM/KPAM process\r\n2.  Isopropylamine [2-Propanamine] CAS 75-31-0 used in Nemacur process\r\n\r\nThe Accutely Hazardous Material associated with the METAM/KPAM process is carbon disulfide. Carbon Disulfide is loaded from iso-containers into storage tank within concrete dike. The storage tank is equipped with level control device. A shutdown interlock on high level will close valve in the unload line. Unload pump will shut down on low flow (dry run protection). Loss of instrument air, electricity or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations.\r\n\r\nThe Accutely Hazardous Material associated with the Dibrom process is bromine. The bromine is stored onsite in a storage tank, located in an enclosed concrete dike.  Bromine arrives onsite via railcar or truck.  The storage tank is equipped with level control devices that will automatically shut off supply of bromine into the tank. \r\n\r\n3.0  The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s):\r\n\r\nThe worst case release scenario for Carbon Disulfide was considered.For the purpose of conducting Offsite Consequence Analysis, absolute worst case and alternative release scenarios were selected.  Worst case scenarios are mandated by the RMP rule.  For the regulated chemicals used at AMVAC these assumed a total failure of all systems in place and a total release of the chemical inventory."

      "SummaryText": "The criteria used to choose an alternative release scenario is an attempt to more closely define a serious release episode that could conceivably occur, but is still substantially more severe than expected with the safety and monitoring equiment in use.  These scenarios include the following:\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario for covered Toxic Substances:\r\n\r\nCarbon Disulfide has been considered as a toxic substance considered for this scenario.  EPA Dispersion Model RMP*Comp was used for this determination.  The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the carbon disulfide storage tank (V-303) with 30,000 gallon capacity. 315,000 pounds of carbon disulfide would be released into its concrete dike.  The event would have off-site consequenses.  RMP*Comp indicated that the estimated distance to toxic endpoint was 4.3 miles. An event of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. \r\n\r\nBromine has also been considered as a toxic substance considered for worst case scenario.  The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the bromine storage tank containing 104,000 pounds into its concrete dike.  The event would have off-site consequenses.  An event of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. Bromine is stored in storage tank V-126, which has a capacity of 4,000 gallons. At 26 pounds per gallon, the worst case scenario involved a release of 104,000 pounds of bromine. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 3.4 miles.\r\n\r\nChlorine is used in DCMAA and Fortress processes. Chlorine is delivered in 2,000 pound cylinders and are stored in racks capable of holding 12 cylinders. Worst case scenario involved release on entire cylinder, resulting in 2,000 pounds of chlorine being discharged over a 10 minute period. RMP*Comp model estimated the distance to toxic endpoint to be 0.9 miles. This is the downwind distance t"

Area monitors are utilized to detect the presence of any chlorine vapors. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios for each covered Toxic Substance:\r\n\r\nAn alternate release scenario for carbon disulfide (METAM/KPAM process) would be a leak to develop in the transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor, resulting in 200 gallons of carbon disulfide spilled onto concrete floor. ALOHA 5.4.1 dispersion model was used to estimate alternative scenario releases for carbon disulfide. An evaporating puddle over 25 square feet (200 gallons), with stability class D was used as input. An estimate of 500 pounds was release to atmosphere and the model predicted that the endpoint of 1 ppm occurs 320 yards from source.\r\n\r\nAlternate release scenarios for other compounds also involve a leak that develops in the pipe on the bottom discharge from the storage tank.  The solution leaks into the concrete containment dike for 20 minutes before the leak is isolated and the flow stopped.\r\n\r\nAn alternate scenario for a bromine pipe leak of 500 pounds resulted in an estimated distance to endpoint of 0.3 miles (RMP*Comp).\r\n\r\nThe alternate scenario for a chlorine release is a pipe leak of 150 pounds. The estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.3 miles. There are no public receptors within this area.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario for Flammable substances:\r\n\r\nMethylamine (MMA)is classified as a flammable substance and is used as a raw material in the KPAM/METAM process. MMA is offloaded from railcars, in gaseous state into storage tanks T-301 and T-302, which have been pre-charged with water. The capacity of the railcar is 160,000 pounds of MMA. The worst case scenario at AMVAC Axis results from the complete release of contents of the railcar. Using RMP*Comp, an estimate of 160,000 pounds (vapor cloud explosion) with wind speed 1.5 m/s and stability class G, @ 77F, resulted in"

An incident of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in the report. \r\n\r\nIsopropylamine [2-Propanamine] is a raw material used in the Nemacur process. Isopropylamine is identified as a flammable liquid in Table 3 of 40 CFR 68. Isopropylamine is stored in storage tank V-421. This storage tank has 8,000 gallon capacity and is located within concrete containment dike. It will be received in tank trucks and unloaded via a seal less pump into V-421. Worst case scenario, using RMP*Comp, simulated total loss of storage tank V-421. Input parameters included 46,037 pounds released, Vapor Cloud Explosion, Liquid Temperature 45 degrees F. Mitigation measures include diked area 425 feet, dike height 4 feet. Assumptions include wind speed 1.5 meters/second, stability class F, Air temperature 77 degrees F.

There is a written agreement between both parties that there will be mutual response for site wide emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe AMVAC Axis facility is equiped with mutiple levels of protection.  The potential for spills and releases is low.  In the event that a spill or release occurs, there are established written procedures for the handling emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe procedures for handling emergencies include the Emergency Response Plan and the Operating Procedures Manuals for each area.  The Emergency Response Plan for the AMVAC facility includes written procedures for handling releases and spills of hazardous materials in any area and contains specific emergency procedures for bomb threat, firefighting, emergency alarm activation, evacuation, offsite emergencies, local area emergency notification, government agency notification and hurricanes.  The operating procedure manual for each process area contains emergency response information for the area.\r\n\r\nTo maintain and upgrade the emergency response capabilities, AMVAC conducts inspections of the facility and the equipment, and emergency response drills are conducted simultaneously with the DuPont drills.
