Crude hydrogen is compressed, then purified via pressure swing adsorption to produce hydrogen gas, which is then purify compressed and fed into hydrogen pipelines.  The plant will be started in November 2016.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is:\r\n- Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, ethylene, ethane, and other components.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPrevention Program:\r\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps:\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, we have implemented safety features specific to the covered process at our facility. Following is a description of some of these safety features.\r\n-At this location we have field mounted fire alarm control systems which tie into the central control unit that will alarm and indicate the location of the problem.\r\n-Fire extinguishers are located in key areas of the plant.
