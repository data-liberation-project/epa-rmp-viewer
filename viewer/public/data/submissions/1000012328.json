              "Description": "FACILITY PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nThe various prevention programs described in existing CKCC plant operations manuals are intended to ensure the safety of workers, the public, and the surrounding environment. The CKCC facility has implemented, and will update if necessary, the existing power facility procedures and will continue the training of personnel to familiarize them with equipment and process operations, and maintenance and safety procedures. Programs and procedures currently implemented to prevent, identify, and mitigate accidental releases of regulated substances are described in the facilityA?s plant operations manuals. Examples of these procedures are:\n\nA?Emergency Action Plan and Procedures\n\nA?Lockout/Tagout Procedures \n\nA?Contractor Safety Program \n\nA?Hot Work Program \n\nA?Confined Space Safety Program \n\nA?Fire Prevention Plan\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY PROGRAM\n\nProcess safety information is essential to the effective operation of the facility. Facility staff must have current process safety information in order to deal with equipment or process operations, chemicals used in the various processes, and maintenance procedures. Current process safety information that is readily available to facility staff is a necessary element of the prevention program.\n\nThe facility has compiled process safety information, which satisfies the regulatory requirements of the RMP Regulations. This information will allow facility staff to identify and understand the hazards with regard to the use of listed substances in the existing facility processes. The following process safety information is an integral part of the prevention program:\n\nA?Substance Data A? The facility maintains material safety data sheets (MSDS) for all substances used at the facility. MSDS data will be kept for all chemicals and/or mixtures of chemicals or listed substances. The MSDS will be available in the plant control room, and at other specified locations as determined by plant safety staff.\n\nA?Process Information A? Process information is available in the Plant Manuals: these manuals present data on the theory of the process operation, safe operations limits, process operations diagrams, and operational procedures.\n\nA?Equipment Information A? Equipment information is maintained in the Plant Manuals: this information describes the specific equipment, how it functions in relationship to and with the overall process, equipment operations limits, equipment substance use, equipment maintenance procedures, and equipment monitoring requirements.\n\nA?Maintenance procedures for process equipment and detailed instructions for equipment shutdown, and startup.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a set of Plant Manuals (10 Volume Set) for the existing equipment and processes. Information in these manuals has been integrated into the existing facility programs with respect to: (1) process safety, (2) training, (3) existing safety plans, (4) maintenance program, (5) startup and shutdown procedures, and (6) operational procedures for normal and non-normal operations. Personnel from the facility will verify that any new equipment complies with existing standards and accepted good engineering practices. Facility staff, in conjunction with design and operations staff have verified that all equipment is designed, inspected, tested, and readied for operation in a safe manner. Implementation of the existing facility operations and maintenance procedures will continue to ensure safe operations. Process safety information for the ammonia process is maintained in these plant manuals. These manuals are available for inspection during normal operation hours. This information is provided to show the scope and depth of coverage in the facility plant manuals.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS (PHA)\n\nA systematized evaluation of the new equipment and processes has and will continue to be implemented in an effort to protect facility employees, the public, and the surrounding environment. This type of evaluation is called a A?process hazards analysisA? or PHA. The purpose of the PHA is as follows:\n\nA?    Identify equipment or process hazards.\n\nA?    Identify equipment failures that could lead to an accidental release.\n\nA?    Identify staff errors (operations or maintenance) that could lead to accidental releases.\n\nA?    Evaluate the consequences of such releases.\n\nA?    Identify additional program measures that may be needed to mitigate or prevent the release.\n\nA?    Identify additional training and/or safety related needs.\n\n\n\nThe PHA revalidation was conducted by Risk Management Professionals, Inc on August 4, 2009 will serve as the revised PHA for the CKCC ammonia storage and distribution system. The What-If/Checklist method was used to identify and evaluate the hazards of the process. The Process Hazard Analysis Team members used the risk-ranking matrix to qualitatively assess the risk associated with cause/consequence scenarios.  \n\nAfter the consequences and safeguards were developed, the scenario was evaluated based on how serious the potential consequence are (severity), and how probable it is that the scenario would fully develop to those consequences (likelihood).  The severity ranking (1-4) and likelihood ranking (1-4) are combined using the risk ranking matrix to provide qualitative risk ranking.  Each scenario evaluated was ranked with a SLR value, S representing severity, L representing likelihood (probability) and R representing risk. The revised PHA was based upon the system design P&ID and the system layout, i.e., system component locations on the existing site.\n\n\n\nA multidisciplinary PHA team was assembled to identify and evaluate potential hazards associated with the Ammonia/SCR systems, The Team members, included plant personnel with significant experience in design and operation of the system and CalARP/EPA RMP/CalOSHA PSM compliance. The Team members are listed in Table 3 of the PHA Revalidation Report. \n\nThe team focused on the identification and evaluation of hazards from the processes and listed substances used, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and made suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believed such measures were necessary. The revised PHA will be reviewed every five (5) years hereafter. \n\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROCESS INFORMATION\n\nThe MSDS contains detailed data on the physical and chemical characteristics of anhydrous ammonia including, but not limited to: toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, reactivity data, corrosivity data, stability data, and health effects data.\n\n\n\nAdditional hazardous affects of inadvertent mixing anhydrous ammonia are:\n\nAnhydrous ammonia has potentially explosive reactions with strong oxidizers. Anhydrous ammonia forms explosive mixtures in air with hydrocarbons, chlorine, ethanol, fluorine and silver nitrate. Anhydrous ammonia reacts to form explosive products, mixtures or compounds with mercury, gold, silver, iodine, bromine and silver oxide. Avoid anhydrous ammonia contact with chlorine, which forms a chloramine gas, which is a primary skin irritant and sensitizer. Avoid anhydrous ammonia contact with galvanized surfaces, copper, brass, bronze, aluminum alloys, mercury, gold and silver. A corrosive reaction will occur.\n\n\n\nThe Operations and Maintenance Manuals contain detailed information on the process and associated equipment and systems, safe operating limits, maintenance procedures, materials of construction, electrical and mechanical classifications, design codes, materials and energy balances, and information on safety systems associated with the identified process. These manuals are available for inspection during normal business hours.\n\n\n\nThe primary equipment associated with the ammonia based SCR system is as follows:\n\n1.Ammonia Storage Tank and Truck Unloading Equipment\n\n2. Ammonia Flow/Vaporizer Skid and Piping to Injection Grid\n\nThe ammonia tank has a design capacity of 12,000 gallons. Administrative controls limit the tank fill capacity to ~85% or 10,200 gallons. The tank has a diameter (OD) of 8 ft. and a length of 30 ft. Maximum design pressure is 265 psig at 120 deg F. The ammonia flow control skid has (2) dilution air fans each rated at 350 scfm. Anhydrous ammonia is routed from the flow control unit to the injection grid. Injection occurs within the confines of the exhaust system prior to the SCR catalyst. Control of NOx emissions is achieved by controlling ratio of ammonia to fuel input to the combustion turbine, and the subsequent reaction within the catalyst bed. The ammonia unloading area does not currently have a secondary containment area or underground sump. Spills in the unloading area will discharge directly to the ground surface.\n\nThe ammonia system is comprised of the following safety systems: ammonia detection, pressure relief valves, excess flow check valves, deluge system, safety showers, tank level alarms, interlocks. \n\n\n\nAn ammonia leak detection system is provided for monitoring ammonia concentration near the ammonia tank. Ammonia concentrations above 30 ppm will be alarmed in the DCS and the ammonia detection panel located inside the control room. The tank is protected form overpressure by two sets of dual safety relief valves.  Each set consist of two relief valves, with a 3-way valve on their common inlet line. Each process connection on the tank is equipped with an excess flow check valve, which is designed to close upon excessive discharge of vapor or liquid resulting from a line break. A manual water deluge system is provided for fog spray should a large ammonia release occur. The vaporizer is protected from overpressure by a relief valve. The ammonia injection system pressure is controlled via two control valves in series. The ammonia tank is equipped with level alarms. High and low level are alarmed in the DCS in the control room. The ammonia isolation valve is interlocked with the SCR inlet temperature and the dilution air flow.  The ammonia isolation valve will open when both the SCR inlet temperature and the dilution air flow permissive are met. \n\nThe facility is equipped with continuous emission monitors for NOx, CO, and O2. Measurements from these systems are used to further trim ammonia use and injection rates.\n\n\n\nCalpine developed a Plant Physical Security standard in May 2013. The standard establishes Calpine?s process for managing physical security, including minimum inspection and maintenance frequencies for physical security systems. Additionally, the standard defines the physical security systems that should be established at each affected Calpine Site based on the results of a fleet-wide physical security assessment and communication with local Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) offices. The standard requires an ongoing awareness of security risks at each Site to be incorporated into the development and maintenance of a Plant Physical Security Plan. The Site  is responsible for developing and implementing security systems including, but not limited to:\n\n?    Barriers\n\n?    Access Control\n\n?    Monitoring\n\n?    Communications\n\n?    Lighting\n\n?    Alarms\n\n\n\nIn January 2010 the facility installed a new camera surveillance system.  The new surveillance system improves the site security by increasing the total number of cameras to be able to view multiple plant areas at one time and having direct view of the ammonia unloading area.

This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n\n\n-Acknowledge the continued operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and  requirements. (EPA RMP Facility ID# 1000-0016-4877)\n\n\n\nCKCC uses anhydrous ammonia and stores greater than 20,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia making the site subject to both the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and the Federal RMP Program under 40 CFR 68. The site is subject to the OSHA and EPA Process Safety Management Regulations. The site has been determined to be a Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nThe RMP addresses the Program 3 requirements of CalARP as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These requirements build upon the provisions of the general duty clause of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP Program 3 requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n\n\n-identify hazards\n\n-design and maintain a safe facility\n\n-prevent releases\n\n-minimize the consequences of releases.\n\n\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented RMP, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility will take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. \n\nPursuant to CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\n\n\nThis RMP applies to the CKCC facility located at:\n\n750 Metz Road\n\nKing City, CA.  93930\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe CKCC facility is a 111-megawatt (MW) (nominal output) natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant. Electricity generated by CKCC is sold to Pacific Gas and Electric Compa"
