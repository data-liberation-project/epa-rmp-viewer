This group monitors the on site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated site. In addition, the corporate safety group is responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs. These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in August 1999.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 4000A 142nd Ave. E. in Sumner, Washington 98390, just east of State Highway 167.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 16,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the sy"

      "SummaryText": "stem.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including each ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment. This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the five year accident history review included in the Hazard Assessment Update, there have been no ammonia-related accidents at the facility to report. (Note - the facility was new in August 1999, therefore the accident history is from August 1999 - May 2004.)\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize p"

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, Costco Wholesale plans to evacuate all employees stationed in the cold storage warehouse and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  Costco Wholesale plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAll mitigation measures from the initial Process Hazard Analysis (August 1999) have been implemented. In addition, there were no new equipment-specific mitigation measure proposed during the revalidaiton session conducted in September 2003. Costco Wholesale is proceeding with a few remaining mitigation measures associated with their compliance audit conducted in October 2002. These include updating management information included in the written programs, verifying certain alarm conditions, and evaluating the performance of their refrigeration contractor. In addition, Costco Wholesale has a corporate program that includes annual review meetings with on site personnel to ensure on going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs."
