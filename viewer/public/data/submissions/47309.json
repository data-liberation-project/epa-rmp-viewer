      "SummaryText": "WEST JOHNSON COUNTY RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant, located approximately 5 miles west of Cleburne in Johnson County, Texas, produces natural gas liquids from natural gas. These natural gas liquids are comprised primarily of ethane, propane and butane. The plant also treats natural gas liquids to remove CO2. Some of the chemicals produced or used include methane, ethane, propane, butane, ethylene glycol and diethanolamine.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThere are no toxic chemicals stored at the West Johnson County gas plant above the EPA Threshold Quantity. The threshold quantity is the level set by EPA for each toxic or flammable chemical which if stored at the site requires compliance with the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations. Generally, if the amount of a substance stored on-site is less than the threshold quantity, there is little danger to the public.\n\nThere are several flammable substances stored at the site above the 10,000 pound threshold quantity for flammables. Examples of flammables at the site include ethane, propane and butane. Information on the worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario is available from the EPA per security guidelines.\n\n    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has a very active accident prevention program in place, primarily based on the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations.

These documents include material safety data sheets for all chemicals on-site, up-to-date process and instrumentation drawings, equipment data sheets on all vessels and equipment and process parameter safety limits. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has a very comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The what-if/checklist analysis technique is used to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people with operating, maintenance, engineering and safety experience. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. All approved recommendations from the PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design and to ensure that new technology is used where appropriate, the West Johnson County gas plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant maintains written procedures that addre"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.\n\nTraining\n\nOur employees at the West Johnson County plant have extensive experience in gas processing. This level of experience provides a great level of expertise throughout the facility. Ongoing training is accomplished through routine safety meetings, scheduled training in new processes and refresher training on operating procedures.\n\nContractors\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or to assist with specialized projects. Contractors are advised about safety and health hazards, emergency response requirements and safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the company evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel routinely monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain our equipment in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include inspections, tests and corrections of identified deficiencies. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment operates within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service or they will determine what actions are necessary to ensure safe operation of the equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has long-standing safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include lockout/tagout to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipm"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe West Johnson County gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the West Johnson County gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
