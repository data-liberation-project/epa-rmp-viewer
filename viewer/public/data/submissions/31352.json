Introduction\n\n\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, contractors, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry has established a  system to help ensure the safe operation of chemical processes at this facility.  One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that is required by the USEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements (RMP Rule) in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68. One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RM Plan), which describes the risk management programs at the facility for review by the USEPA and the public.\n\n\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors, the public and the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our personnel will respond to control and contain the releases.  In most foreseeable circumstances releases could be controlled by shutting down operations and/or by applying generous quantities of water to absorb and dilute the release since all of our regulated chemicals are water soluble. If necessary, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry will evacuate onsite personnel and contact the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), fire department and police to help handle the emergency and to help warn the public.\n\n\n\n3. Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Houston Plant stores regulated substances for use in several chemical processes. In each process the regulated substances are chemically transformed into less haz"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry Houston Plant:\n\n\n\n4.1    Employee participation\n\n\n\nAkzo Nobel Surface Chemistry encourages and insists upon employee participation in process safety management.  Knowledgeable operators write operating procedures, review new or modified product recipes, and are included in process hazard analyses.  Employees attend safety meetings monthly. Meetings begin with a safety topic to increase safety awareness and employee involvement. Several operators have been pulled off of regular duties for extended periods to review and comment on new designs and to help train themselves and others on major process changes before implementation. \n\n\n\n4.2    Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains extensive information on its chemical hazards, processes, procedures and equipment, which is used by employees as needed to help them do their jobs safely. \n\n\n\n4.3    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nNew and existing processes are examined using formalized methods of hazard analysis.  These methods are designed to help knowledgeable employees recognize process hazards. Recommended actions are tracked until resolution.\n\n\n\n4.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Houston Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operatio"

Operating procedure are available from document control department and control rooms where operators work.\n\n\n\n4.5    Training\n\n\n\nSafety training is conducted monthly and the topics change each month. Process safety topics are covered during several months of the year.  The safety topics are posted on a safety calendar, which is available to employees. Initial training is provided to new employees.  Experienced operators train new employees on the proper operating procedures until they believe from direct observation that the newer employee is ready to run the process. Refresher training is conducted periodically.\n\n\n\n4.6    Contractors\n\n\n\nThe Houston Plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased construction or maintenance activities.  Contractor's safety performance is reviewed before hiring the contractors.  Contractors are given safety training prior to being allowed to work in the plant to help assure that our safety procedures are followed. A permit system is in place, which requires contractors to obtain written approval in the form of a work permit from knowledgeable Plant personnel before work by a contractor commences on a regulated process.  Contractors are informed of the process hazards before written approval to commence work is given.\n\n\n\n4.7    Pre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a PSSR before any new or modified process is operated to make sure that the new or modified facilities and the associated procedures are safe to use for operation. \n\n\n\n4.8    Mechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe facility has an ongoing system to maintain the process equipment in good working order as needed for safe operation. The facility has procedures in place for the testing and inspection of equipment and makes sure that equipment is operated within the safe operating limits.

Operations and engineering management personnel assure that changes are not authorized until it is safe to do so and the necessary safety requirements are met.\n\n\n\n4.11    Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe facility has procedures in place that require the reporting and investigation of incidents that result in or could reasonably have resulted in a fire, explosion, or toxic release. Any urgent recommendations resulting from the incident investigation are addressed promptly and other recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  A file is maintained to record the incident history for review and for consideration in the next process hazard analysis.\n\n\n\n4.12    Audits\n\n\n\nAudits are conducted every 3 years and reports are written to which the facility must respond.  The status of recommendations is tracked until resolution.\n\n\n\n5.

Dikes are provided for the storage tanks.  All of the vessels are protected with self-closing relief valves and all of the vessels are maintained under an inert atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe ethylene oxide and propylene oxide suppliers have well developed product stewardship programs and periodically visit the site to provide assistance in the safe handling of oxides and special training materials are provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2    Isopropylamine and Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe isopropylamine and aqueous ammonia are stored at ambient temperatures under  nitrogen blankets.  The tanks are located in a diked area with a nearby drain to a large wastewater basin.  Any spilled material would not tend to accumulate underneath the tanks, but would tend to flow to and be diluted in the wastewater basin. A firewater monitor nozzle is located nearby for use in fighting fires or diluting leaks to reduce the chance of a fire or to greatly lessen the impact of a toxic release.  A scrubber is provided to absorb vapors from normal venting or emergency relief.\n\n\n\n5.3    Sulfur dioxide storage\n\n\n\nThe sulfur dioxide is stored in thick walled steel containers to resist breakage from mishandling.  Each container holds about 200 gallons, which is less than the threshold quantity of sulfur dioxide. The cylinder storage area is protected from traffic by a wall and steel barriers. The cylinders are not stored near other tanks or containers. The plant has repair kits to help stop leaks and leakage could be absorbed with firewater. \n\n\n\n6.
