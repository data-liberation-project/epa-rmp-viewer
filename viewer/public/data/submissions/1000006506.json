We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.\n    Each chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent and minimize the effects of hazards such as fire, chemical release, process control and explosions.  The utilization of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) techniques has been applied at Honeywell Hopewell for many years. The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n    \n    Written operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response.

An accident-investigation procedure\n \n\n(4)  Five-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been three recorded cases in the last five years where the Honeywell Hopewell has notified the US EPA regarding RMP events.  Honeywell Hopewell received return acknowledgement that the facility record had been updated.\n\n(a)    On August 17, 2004 Honeywell Hopewell notified the National Response Center (NRC) (RN732130) of an ammonia release that occurred about 1231 hours.  A relief valve opened, allowing approx"

All appropriate local, state and federal agencies were promptly notified.  Honeywell Hopewell activated the Shelter-in-Place system for the City of Hopewell.  There was not any off-site health effect noted even though the Shelter-in-Place system was utilized.\n\n(b)    On March 18, 2005, about 1645 hours Honeywell Hopewell notified the NRC and appropriate local and state response officials that approximately 450 pounds of ammonia was released from the Kellogg Ammonia Production Unit.  The duration of the event, approximately 10 seconds, did not initiate the Shelter-in-Place system for the City of Hopewell.  However, the activation of the plant emergency system, with notification of  neighboring industry, warrants recording.  There was not any off-site health effect noted even though the Shelter-in-Place system was utilized.\n\n(c)    On March 28, 2005, about 2254 hours Honeywell Hopewell notified the NRC (RN754107) that approximately 5170 pounds of acetaldehyde were released from the Specialty Chemicals operation.  The Hopewell Fire Department was notified and a Shelter-in-Place situation was declared.  All appropriate local, state and federal agencies were promptly notified.  There was not any off-site health effect noted even though the Shelter-in-Place system was utilized.\n\n(d)    On November 30, 2006, about 1320 hours there was an Oleum leak on a small supply line in the Sulfuric Acid Plant.  The Emergency Brigade responded and was able to isolate the leak at approximately 1:30 PM.  As a precaution, the site sheltered in place during the incident.  During the emergency, in-plant and fence-line monitoring was conducted.  Results at the fence-line indicated safe levels, however, due to the wind direction, we notified the neighboring plant to also shelter-in-place as a precaution.  The release to the air continued until the pipe drained completely a"

Approximately 639 pounds of ammonia was released to the atmosphere.  The Honeywell Hopewell Incident Commander initiated the Shelter-in-Place system.  All appropriate local, state and federal agencies were promptly notified.  There was not any off-site health effect noted even though the Shelter-in-Place system was utilized.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)  Emergency Response Plan:\n\nIt is the policy of Honeywell Hopewell to operate a safe and environmentally sound facility by identifying and controlling health, safety and environmental risks related to its operations.  By designing its processes to protect people, property and the environment and by conducting and regularly reviewing and improving processes and programs, Honeywell Hopewell has an active prevention strategy for its chemical processes. Chemical risk management involves the integration of safety devices and technologies inherent in the design of the process, safe operational procedures and management practices, operator training, emergency response planning, maintenance of process and emergency response equipment, coordination of resources and plans with the local and state emergency services and communication with the community.\n\nThe plan is designed to alert employees by an audible alarm system and as the situation dictates, notify the community through the local police and fire departments.  Evacuation procedures are included in the emergency response plan.  Communication is provided through a specialized radio service, where Honeywell Hopewell can review the situation and coordinate directly with other emergency response agencies.  Direct 2-way radio links are in place to quickly notify local school systems and media sou"

      "SummaryText": "rces.  \n\nHoneywell Hopewell has its own emergency response brigade made up of approximately 80 trained, qualified, certified emergency response individuals.  These responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools in Texas and Nevada.  These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and local police, fire, rescue and other emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year. \n\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nHoneywell Hopewell strives to continually improve process safety at the site.  Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \n\nAlso, Honeywell Hopewell benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.  As one part of the investigation tool, we have trained about 180 salaried and hourly employees in root cause analysis, an investigative system designed to identify and correct the causes of equipment and procedural failures.  It is widely used to help improve our level of safety and environmental performance.\n\n    Managing change is a key activities task associated with process safety and risk management.  Detailed procedural steps have been developed to provide guidance for operations personnel in making necessary process and mechanical changes to maintain a safe plant and achieve a high level of performance.  Multi-departmental approvals are requir"
