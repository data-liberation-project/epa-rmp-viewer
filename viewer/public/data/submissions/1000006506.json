We also maintain comprehensive evaluations of the process chemistry and operating conditions of our processes.\n\tEach chemical process is analyzed utilizing a method designed to identify, prevent and minimize the effects of hazards such as fire, chemical release, process control and explosions.  The utilization of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) techniques has been applied at Honeywell Hopewell for many years. The process safety analysis approach is applied to major modifications and also to minor operating changes.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we can maintain the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards and their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.\n\t\n\tWritten operating procedures are structured to cover the significant aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of Honeywell Hopewell has specific operating procedures developed by people knowledgeable in the operation of that area, the operators and area supervisors.\n\n\tBesides standard operating procedures, Honeywell Hopewell has developed training materials to support the development of individuals into trained and qualified process operators.

These responders receive additional training in chemical plant emergency response and many have been trained at nationally known emergency response schools in Texas and Nevada.  These plans and responses to incidents are tested annually through drills involving the brigade and local police, fire, rescue and other emergency service personnel. The brigade receives periodic training e.g., tabletop drills and hands-on exercises, throughout the year. \n\n(6) Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nHoneywell Hopewell strives to continually improve process safety at the site.  Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \n\nAlso, Honeywell Hopewell benchmarks companies to achieve a higher level of safety, and comprehensive incident investigations enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.
