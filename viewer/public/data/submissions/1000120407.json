Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nFuture Foam, Inc. is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\nFuture Foam, Inc.is a urethane foam manufacturing facility which produces various type of flexible urethane foam products located in Elkhart, IN. The facility fabricates some of the urethane foam into various finished products.\nFlexible urethane foam is a product made by combining various chemicals that undergo a chemical reaction. The finished product is produced in a variety of colors, thicknesses, and densities.  One of chemicals used is 2, 4-Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI). The TDI is stored in up to eight (8) 30,000 gal tanks.  The TDI Storage tanks have a combined storage capacity of 240,000 gallons. The 240,000 gallons of TDI equates to 2,440,800 pounds of TDI.  For safety reasons, these tanks are never filled past 95%. \nThe EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) is part of the Clean Air Act and applies to a process storing a specified chemical above a threshold quantity. The chemicals and threshold quantities are specified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. One such chemical is Toluene 2, 4-Diisocynate (TDI) in excess of 10,000 pounds which is used as an ingredient in the manufacturing process.\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Based on the Off Site Consequence Analysis, facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 1 of the RMP regulations.\n\nC.  Accide"

An appropriate response to releases of TDI is in the written Risk Management Program. Safety, environmental, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response. \nFuture Foam, Inc.'s specific prevention steps include:\n1. Develop, review and update operating and maintenance procedures for the TDI process.\n2. Provide the appropriate training for TDI process operators, maintenance personnel, and emergency response personnel.\n3. Conduct timely investigations of all incidents involving the TDI process.\n4. Conduct RMP Compliance audits as per RMP regulations.\n\nD. Hazard Assessment: (OCA)\nThe RMP requires Future Foam, Inc. to evaluate the maximum potentially affected area for accidents involving TDI for a worst-case release scenario and an alternative scenario.\nThe worst-case release is highly improbable since it involves the combination of a certain set of conditions for a large release of the chemical without any employee intervention.  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative. The endpoints specified for regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public. The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered an area in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic accident. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather a basis for any specific actions.\n\nA catastrophic release of one 30,000 gallon storage"

It is assumed the catastrophic release would release the entire contents of the tank. The impact distance from the worst-case scenario has been estimated using EPA's ALOHA Model.  The ALOHA Method estimates a distance to the endpoint of 108 yards for the worse-case release scenario. The impact distance does not include public receptors.\n \n         \nE. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nOperating Procedures: Future Foam, Inc. has developed written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where TDI is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, safety systems and their functions. The operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the TDI system. These operating procedures will be reviewed as often as necessary to assure that they reflect current operating practice. Future Foam, Inc. has developed and implemented safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the TDI facility.\nTraining: Future Foam, Inc. will continue to provide training for each employee associated with the TDI system. This training will include an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined in 40 CFR 68.54.  Refresher training is provided every three (3) years or more often as necessary.

Records of the two (2) most recent compliance audit reports will be maintained.\nIncident Investigation: Future Foam, Inc. will investigate each incident, which results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of TDI. Incident investigations will be initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. The incident investigation team will consist of at least one Future Foam, Inc. person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor.
