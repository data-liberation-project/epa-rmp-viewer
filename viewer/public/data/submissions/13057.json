              "Description": "   The ammonia neutralization process is a batch process in which phosphonates are neutralized with anhydrous ammonia ( NH3) in a  stirred tank,  pressure vessel (reactor). The ammonia flow to the reactor is controlled so that almost all of the ammonia is reacted. Any excess ammonia is vented to the plant scrubber system, where it is absorbed. Safety relief devices are installed on the  reactor to prevent  a catastrophic failure of the reactor should an unlikely overpressurization  situation occur. .                                                                                                              .               The major bulk of the ammonia onsite is in the storage tank. The storage tank is a 250 psig rated pressure vessel. Safety relief devices are also  installed on the tank to prevent a rupture of the tank that might be  caused by an overpressure situation. The ammonia pressure at all ambient temperature conditions is well below 200 psig.  An excess flow valve is also installed between the tank and the plant piping that will stop the flow of ammonia from the tank as a result of a  pipe failure or an excessive flow rate  to the reactor. Check valves are also insta.lled in the ammonia delivery lines to prevent backflowof potential contaminants to the storage vessel.                                                                                             The loading of the storage tank from a delivery tank truck is accomplished by use of a closed loop vapor recycle system in which the liquid ammonia is pumped from the bottom of the tank truck by a compressor to the bottom of the storage tank, and the ammonia vapor from the top of the storage tank is recycled back to the tank truck so that no ammonia is exhausted to the atmosphere. The plant operator and truck driver handle: the connection of the truck to the storage vessel; the unloading of the truck;  and the uncoupling of the truck from the storage tank.  Both the plant operators and truck drivers have been trained and are experienced in the safe handling of ammonia.                                       A process hazards analysis (PHA) has has been conducted on the process from truck delivery to reactor operation and finished product.                                                                                                      Written maintenance procedures are in place to insure on going integrity of the process equipment and piping. Inspections include ultrasound thickness tests and visual inspection of glass lined reactors.   Leaking pumps, lines, and valves are tagged and repaired by maintenance in a timely manner.",

              "Description": "The bisulfite process is analagous to the ammonia neutralization process, in that it is a batch process where sulfur dioxide (SO2) is reacted in a pressurized, stirred tank reactor. The reactor is protected by safety relief devices from a catastrophic failure caused by over  pressurization.  The difference between the bisulfite batch  process and the ammonia neutralization batch  process  is that SO2 is acidic, and ammonia is basic.                   The SO2 addition (flow) to the reactor is controlled so that it is almost completely reacted.  The reactor is first purged with nitrogen (N2) to remove any oxygen prior to the addition of SO2.  Any excess SO2 remaining after the reaction is purged to the plant scrubber system by N2. The plant  scrubber system supresses emmission of SO2 to the atmosphere.  N2 is also used to purge the SO2 delivery lines from the reactor  back to the storage vessel.                                                                                                             Like the ammonia, the major amount of SO2 on site is contained in the 250 psig rated storage vessel. The SO2 in the storage tank is blanketed with N2 to exclude oxygen. The N2 blanket pressure and ambient pressures of SO2 are well below the storage tank's rated pressure.  Like the reactor, the SO2 storage tank is protected from a catastrophic release by safety relief devices.  The tank is also inspected by an outside source every three years, with the last  inspection being  5/28/98.                                                                Like the ammonia tank,  the SO2 storage tank is also loaded from a delivery truck by the use of a closed loop recycle system between the storage tank and the delivery truck to prevent emissions of SO2  to the atmosphere.  Plant process operators, supervisors and delivery truck drivers have been formally trained in the safe handling and loading and unloading of SO2. Operater training is conducted on a yearly basis, with the last  training session being on 8/27/98.                                                                              A  process hazard  analysis  (PHA)  has been conducted on the SO2 storage and bisulfite batch reaction systems.",
