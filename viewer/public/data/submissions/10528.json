Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Tenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of  processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances \nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as trays that you might find meat or poultry on in a supermarket.  We have one substance present at our facility which is regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is butane; and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The regulated substance at our facility is used as foaming agents in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often called \"blowing agents\" or \"expansion agents\" .\n\nThe maximum inventory of butane possible at our facility is approximately 88000 pounds. Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than this amount from being present in this tank.  \n\n3.    Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nUnder RMP, USEP"

      "SummaryText": "A requires facilities to determine the effects of catastrophic releases of regulated substances.  In facilities which use flammable regulated substances, USEPA defines the worst case scenario for a catastrophic release to be 1 pound per square inch (psi) over-pressure as a result of an instantaneous release of the largest tank volume utilizing no active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under worst-case weather conditions.   USEPA defines alternative release scenarios as 1 psi over-pressure as a result of a timed release of a portion of the largest tank volume utilizing active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under neutral weather conditions.  \n\n To evaluate the worst case scenario for the particular regulated substances and conditions at this facility, we used equations from Appendix D of the USEPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute, a simplified EPA model based on the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For analysis of alternative release scenarios, we also employed the equations provided by the USEPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe activities at the plant can be categorized by Program 3 of the RMP guidance.  The projected worst case release scenario would involve a catastrophic release from the butane storage.  The scenario involves the release of 88,000 pounds of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes were not considered when evaluating this scenario.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the entire quantity of the butane storage tank is released as a vapor, an ignition source is present and 10 percent of the released quantity participates in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of 0.40 miles corresponds to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from the butane"

The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include a deluge system and an automatic shut off valve.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.16 miles.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit under Title V of the Clean Air Act. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating guidelines and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts extensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The approach used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP/Modified What If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, process operations and safety and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  maintains written operating procedures.
