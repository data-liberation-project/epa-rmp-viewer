In order for an operator to be licensed, each must pass a test about the dangers and handling techniques of chlorine gas. Due to the number of operators on site, it is the policy of Inframark and the City of Clinton to notify the Clinton fire department in the event of an accidental release. Plant personnel are not to respond to the release. Their duty is to notify the Clinton Fire Department and local residents.  The Clinton Fire Department has personnel with HAZWOPER training.           (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled; The regulated process from this plant is the water disinfection system.  Disinfection is accomplished with the use of chlorine gas.  Four 1 ton containers (8,000) of chlorine gas is kept on-site and stored in the chlorine structure. The gas is delivered to the site in one-ton cylinders.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.       The worse-case scenario review was the loss of one 1-ton of chlorine in a ten-minute period.  Due to the remote location it is unlikely that the gas would affect inhabited areas. Due to the topography we used and urban setting.  The plant is located in a low area.  It is surrounded by trees and a dam.  The chlorine 1-ton tanks are inside an enclosure with a roof.     In the event of a release, the Clinton Fire Department would be notified, they would take the necessary precautions to protect the public.     We also reviewed and alternate release scenario.  We reviewed the potential for a .31 inch hole in a pipe or cylinder.  Again the fire department would be notified.  We maintain a chlorine repair \"B\" kit for such emergencies a the plant.  This kit and supplies are "
