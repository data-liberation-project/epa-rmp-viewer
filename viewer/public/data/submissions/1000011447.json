Unit supervisors, however, will generally decide what shutdown steps are required before and during evacuation.\n\nThe Incident Commander will inform any or all personnel to vacate portions or all of the facility via the intercom and phone speaker system and to notify the police (911) or local fire department if necessary.  The Incident Commander will notify appropriate government agencies as required. For example, OSHA must be notified if there have been any fatalities or five or more hospitalizations. EPA must be notified on specific spills within 24 hours if quantities are over the threshold amount.\n\nThe senior emergency response official responding shall be in charge of the site. All activities will be coordinated through this person. For an on-site incident, this person in charge could well be a designated employee, who has been trained to the accepted level for Incident Commander.\n\nThe Incident Commander shall identify all hazardous substances or conditions present. The IC shall refer to the site analysis, use of engineering controls, maximum exposure limits, hazardous substance handling procedures, and the use of any new technologies.\n\nAfter assessing the hazardous substances and/or conditions present, the IC must implement appropriate emergency operations, and assure that the PPE worn is appropriate for the hazards to be encountered. If the PPE is worn while performing fire fighting operations it must meet the criteria in 1910.156(e). If an employee, while responding to an emergency, is exposed to an inhalation hazard, then the employee must wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus until such time as the IC determines through air monitoring that it is safe to discontinue its use.\n\nThe IC must limit the number of emergency response personnel at"

MarChem Corporation designs and manufactures custom Polyurethane and PVC formulations for a wide array of industrial applications.  MarChem Corporation does not produce any part, but rather supplies these formulations in a liquid state to end product fabricators. MarChem Corporation has trained technical and quality control staff which does all of the development of our products, follows them through the manufacturing process and tests them for quality before shipment. The site has been in operation for more than 30 years. \n\nCovered Process:\n\nThree parallel batch units are on site in which produce polyurethane pre-polymers or quasi-pre-polymers.  In the covered process the polyurethane pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting long chain polyols with Toluene Diisocyanate in a 2/1 molar ratio to produce NCO terminated high viscosity pre-polymer.  These pre-polymers can be chain extended by the end product fabricators with water, short chain polyols, or diamines to produce high molecular weight polymers.  Quasi-pre-polymers are manufactured by reacting only part of the long chain polyol with Toluene Diisocyanate which improves mixing, reduces volatility, improves compatibility, improves the mix ratio balance, reduces the exotherm and helps match viscosity differences.\n\nReactor RTR-1 and reactor RTR-2 both have a capacity of 550-6000 gallons.  Reactor RTR-3 has a capacity of 550-5800 gallon.  Dry air is used as a blanket in the storage of the Toluene Diisocyanate, in the reactors, and as a blanket over the products produced. All three reactors have hot oil jackets which control the temperature of the reactions. MDA Scientific Monitors with TDI keys are used to monitor levels of Toluene Diisocyanate.  The Monitors sounds an alarm if the atmospheric concentration of Toluene Diisocyanate exceeds 5 ppb.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\n\nMarChem Corporation has had no accidental releases of"
